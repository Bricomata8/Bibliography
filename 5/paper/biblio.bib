@inproceedings{tlig_decentralized_2014,
abstract = {Controlling the vehicle traffic in large networks remains an important challenge in urban environments and trans- portation systems. Autonomous vehicles are today considered as a promising approach to deal with traffic control. In this paper, we propose a synchronization-based intersection control mechanism to allow the autonomous vehicle-agents to cross without stopping, i.e., in order to avoid congestions (delays) and energy loss. We decentralize the problem by managing the traffic of each intersection independently from others. We define control agents which are able to synchronize the multiple flows of vehicles in each intersection, by alternating vehicles from both directions. We present experimental results in simulation, which allow to evaluate the approach and to compare it with a traffic light strategy. These results show the important gain in terms of time and energy at an intersection and in a network.},

abstract = {This paper deals with modelling of traffic networks (TNs) for control purposes. A modular framework based on coloured timed Petri nets (CTPNs) is proposed to model the dynamics of signalized TN systems: places represent link cells and crossing sections, tokens are vehicles and token colours represent the routing of the corresponding vehicle. In addition, ordinary timed Petri nets model the signal timing plans of the traffic lights controlling the area. The proposed modelling framework is applied to a real intersection located in Bari, Italy. A discrete event simulation of the controlled intersection validates the model and tests the signal timing plan obtained by an optimization strategy presented in the related literature.},

Our solution contains two types of nodes Wireless Sensor Node and Border Router/Gateway Node. Wireless Sensor Node: These nodes have sensors integrated and are used to gather the information and send to the Border Router/Gateway Node. They create a mesh network among them, forwarding the packets of other nodes in order to make the information reach the Border Router/Gateway Node. Each Wireless Sensor Node is equipped with a 6LoWPAN (802.15.4) radio, sensors and a battery. It can be either a microcontroller based or Linux based embedded platforms. Border Router/Gateway Node: This node takes the information sent by the Wireless Sensor Nodes and sends it to the Tunneling IPv4 / IPv6 server by using the Ethernet IPv4 interface. Each Border Router/Gateway Node is equipped with a Linux based Single Board Computer, 6LoWPAN (802.15.4) radio and an Ethernet interface and a battery.},

abstract = {While smart cities have the potential to monitor and control the city in real-time through sensors and actuators, there is still an important road ahead to evolve from isolated smart city experiments to real large-scale deployments. Important research questions remain on how and which wireless technologies should be setup for connecting the city, how the data should be analysed and how the acceptance by users of applications can be assessed. In this paper we present the City of Things testbed, which is a smart city testbed located in the city of Antwerp, Belgium to address these questions. It allows the setup and validation of new smart city experiments both at a technology and user level. City of Things consists of a multi-wireless technology network infrastructure, the capacity to easily perform data experiments on top and a living lab approach to validate the experiments. In comparison to other smart city testbeds, City of Things consists of an integrated approach, allowing experimentation on three different layers: networks, data and living lab while supporting a wide range of wireless technologies. We give an overview of the City of Things architecture, explain how researchers can perform smart city experiments and illustrate this by a case study on air quality.},

@article{Al-Fuqaha2015,
abstract = {Several divergent application protocols have been proposed for Internet of Things (IoT) solutions including CoAP, REST, XMPP, AMQP, MQTT, DDS, and others. Each protocol focuses on a specific aspect of IoT communications. The lack of a protocol that can handle the vertical market requirements of IoT applications including machine-to-machine, machine-to-server, and server-to-server communications has resulted in a fragmented market between many protocols. In turn, this fragmentation is a main hindrance in the development of new services that require the integration of multiple IoT services to unlock new capabilities and provide horizontal integration among services. In this work, after articulating the major shortcomings of the current IoT protocols, we outline a rule-based intelligent gateway that bridges the gap between existing IoT protocols to enable the efficient integration of horizontal IoT services. While this intelligent gateway enhances the gloomy picture of protocol fragmentation in the context of IoT, it does not address the root cause of this fragmentation, which lies in the inability of the current protocols to offer a wide range of QoS guarantees. To offer a solution that stems the root cause of this protocol fragmentation issue, we propose a generic IoT protocol that is flexible enough to address the IoT vertical market requirements. In this regard, we enhance the baseline MQTT protocol by allowing it to support rich QoS features by exploiting a mix of IP multicasting, intelligent broker queuing management, and traffic analytics techniques. Our initial evaluation of the lightweight enhanced MQTT protocol reveals significant improvement over the baseline protocol in terms of the delay performance.},
