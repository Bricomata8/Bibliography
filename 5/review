The authors should have compared their results with other infection processes proposed in the literature.
To improve their work,
	the authors can also analyze the contagion process using other metrics to choose the infected node.
For instance,
	it is expected that nodes with high closeness spread the infection quickly.


Although the high similarity rate of the paper,
	the paper presents an extensive survey on evaluating user privacy on social networks.
The authors should consider rephrasing the second and third paragraphs from introduction and the Related Work section in order to avoid the high similarity index with previous papers.
The authors analyze usersâ€™ topological relationships with users trustworthiness level to infer weak social interactions.
The authors should consider proofreading the manuscript because there are some unclear statements and some typos.
Moreover,
	the authors should double-check if the manuscript fits the conference template.
