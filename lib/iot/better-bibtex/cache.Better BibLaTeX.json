The development of D2D is driven by mobile operators to harvest short range communications for improving network performance and supporting proximity-based services. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental and interrelated aspects of D2D communication, security and privacy, which are essential for the adoption and deployment of D2D. We present an extensive review of the state-of-the-art solutions for enhancing security and privacy in D2D communication. By summarizing the challenges, requirements, and features of different proposals, we identify lessons to be learned from existing studies and derive a set of “best practices.” The primary goal of our work is to equip researchers and developers with a better understanding of the underlying problems and the potential solutions for D2D security and privacy. To inspire follow-up research, we identify open problems and highlight future directions with regard to system and communication design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst comprehensive review to address the fundamental security and privacy issues in D2D communication.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  urldate = {2018-06-13},\n  date = {0022/2017},\n  pages = {1054-1079},\n  author = {Haus, Michael and Waqas, Muhammad and Ding, Aaron Yi and Li, Yong and Tarkoma, Sasu and Ott, Jorg},\n  file = {Haus et al_2017_Security and Privacy in Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/USRN64MD/Haus et al_2017_Security and Privacy in Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {MAC},\n  note = {00063}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628494612,"version":0},"$loki":991},{"itemID":2957,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{stellios_survey_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-12T11:46:29Z},\n  title = {A {{Survey}} of {{IoT}}-Enabled {{Cyberattacks}}: {{Assessing Attack Paths}} to {{Critical Infrastructures}} and {{Services}}},\n  issn = {1553-877X},\n  doi = {10.1109/COMST.2018.2855563},\n  shorttitle = {A {{Survey}} of {{IoT}}-Enabled {{Cyberattacks}}},\n  abstract = {As the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth, it is no surprise that many recent cyber attacks are IoT-enabled: The attacker initially exploits some vulnerable IoT technology as a first step towards compromising a critical system that is connected, in some way, with the IoT.

However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks.

Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {1-1},\n  author = {Stellios, I. and Kotzanikolaou, P. and Psarakis, M. and Alcaraz, C. and Lopez, J.},\n  file = {Stellios et al_2018_A Survey of IoT-enabled Cyberattacks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/CJFU9GDS/Stellios et al_2018_A Survey of IoT-enabled Cyberattacks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {MAC},\n  note = {00007}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628494642,"version":0},"$loki":992},{"itemID":2958,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{simiscuka_relay_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:34:40Z},\n  title = {A {{Relay}} and {{Mobility Scheme}} for {{QoS Improvement}} in {{IoT Communications}}},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403755},\n  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) networks inter-connect billions of devices of diverse data types such as multimedia and sensor data.

In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Network},\n  date = {2006-05},\n  pages = {41-47},\n  keywords = {SIR},\n  author = {Xu, Wenyuan and Ma, Ke and Trappe, W. and Zhang, Yanyong},\n  file = {Xu et al_2006_Jamming sensor networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/SYTFJXL4/Xu et al_2006_Jamming sensor networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {MAC},\n  note = {00565}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628494696,"version":0},"$loki":994},{"itemID":3086,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{al-fuqaha_internet_24,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-12T11:46:15Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Internet of {{Things}}: {{A Survey}} on {{Enabling Technologies}}, {{Protocols}}, and {{Applications}}},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {1553-877X, 2373-745X},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7123563/},\n  doi = {10.1109/COMST.2015.2444095},\n  shorttitle = {Internet of {{Things}}},\n  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols, and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols.

The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the ﬁrst phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the ﬁeld, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols ﬁt together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards speciﬁcations. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Petri Nets}} 1989},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {1990},\n  pages = {1-29},\n  author = {Marsan, M.

For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area.

These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the ﬁeld of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their ﬁndings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {0021/2014},\n  pages = {414-454},\n  author = {Perera, Charith and Zaslavsky, Arkady and Christen, Peter and Georgakopoulos, Dimitrios},\n  file = {Perera et al_2014_Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/BTE7E8IU/Perera et al_2014_Context Aware Computing for The Internet of Things.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Weather},\n  note = {01786}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495014,"version":0},"$loki":1010},{"itemID":3286,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{perera_mosden_2013,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-30T15:50:40Z},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  eprint = {1310.4038},\n  primaryClass = {cs},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{MOSDEN}}: {{An Internet}} of {{Things Middleware}} for {{Resource Constrained Mobile Devices}}},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4038},\n  shorttitle = {{{MOSDEN}}},\n  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of Future Internet and will comprise many billions of Internet Connected Objects (ICO) or ‘things’ where things can sense, communicate, compute and potentially actuate as well as have intelligence, multi-modal interfaces, physical/ virtual identities and attributes.

Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classiﬁcation for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016-10-21},\n  author = {van der Heijden, Rens W. and Dietzel, Stefan and Leinmüller, Tim and Kargl, Frank},\n  options = {useprefix=true},\n  file = {van der Heijden et al_2016_Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/W67H3GPW/van der Heijden et al_2016_Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Application},\n  note = {00020}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495056,"version":0},"$loki":1012},{"itemID":3293,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{alvear_architecture_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-03-28T08:51:25Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An {{Architecture Offering Mobile Pollution Sensing}} with {{High Spatial Resolution}}},\n  volume = {2016},\n  issn = {1687-725X, 1687-7268},\n  url = {http://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2016/1458147/},\n  doi = {10.1155/2016/1458147},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Sensors},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-13},\n  author = {Alvear, Oscar and Zamora, Willian and Calafate, Carlos and Cano, Juan-Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {Alvear et al_2016_An Architecture Offering Mobile Pollution Sensing with High Spatial Resolution.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/V8YEMA54/Alvear et al_2016_An Architecture Offering Mobile Pollution Sensing with High Spatial Resolution.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Weather},\n  note = {00010}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495068,"version":0},"$loki":1013},{"itemID":3304,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{alvear_validation_2015,\n  timestamp = {2019-03-28T08:51:26Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Las Vegas, NV, USA}},\n  title = {Validation of a Vehicle Emulation Platform Supporting {{OBD}}-{{II}} Communications},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-6390-4},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7158092/},\n  doi = {10.1109/CCNC.2015.7158092},\n  abstract = {In the next few years, important developments are expected in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) area.

This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  pages = {880-885},\n  author = {Alvear, Oscar and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan-Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {Alvear et al_2015_Validation of a vehicle emulation platform supporting OBD-II communications.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/3Y6VC32N/Alvear et al_2015_Validation of a vehicle emulation platform supporting OBD-II communications.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {IEEE},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495100,"version":0},"$loki":1014},{"itemID":3334,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{zaldivar_providing_2011,\n  timestamp = {2019-03-27T23:14:47Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Bonn, Germany}},\n  title = {Providing Accident Detection in Vehicular Networks through {{OBD}}-{{II}} Devices and {{Android}}-Based Smartphones},\n  isbn = {978-1-61284-928-7 978-1-61284-926-3 978-1-61284-927-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6115556/},\n  doi = {10.1109/LCN.2011.6115556},\n  abstract = {The increasing activity in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) area faces a strong limitation: the slow pace at which the automotive industry is making cars \"smarter\".

Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traﬃc light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve eﬀective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, oﬄoading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource eﬃcient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures.

In this paper, we propose an urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and hidden Markov models (HMM). Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac­ curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth­ ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip­ tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework.

Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our ﬁeld experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA).

Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban trafﬁc. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-ﬁeld experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.},\n  number = {8},\n  journaltitle = {Signal Processing: Image Communication},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2012-09},\n  pages = {900-908},\n  author = {Pau, Giovanni and Tse, Rita},\n  file = {Pau_Tse_2012_Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicular sensing.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/GILXBAN9/Pau_Tse_2012_Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicular sensing.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {IEEE},\n  note = {00017}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495246,"version":0},"$loki":1022},{"itemID":3394,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{gerla_internet_2014,\n  timestamp = {2019-03-27T23:14:51Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Seoul, Korea (South)}},\n  title = {Internet of Vehicles: {{From}} Intelligent Grid to Autonomous Cars and Vehicular Clouds},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-3459-1},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6803166/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803166},\n  shorttitle = {Internet of Vehicles},\n  abstract = {Traditionally, the vehicle has been the extension of the man’s ambulatory system, docile to the driver’s commands.

In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current trafﬁc conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a ﬂow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle trafﬁc over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efﬁcacy in controlling the trafﬁc as the number of vehicles increases.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}} ({{IMIS}})},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}}},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-06},\n  pages = {450-455},\n  author = {Kim, Wooseong and Gerla, Mario},\n  file = {Kim_Gerla_2011_NAVOPT.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/U28YNY9U/Kim_Gerla_2011_NAVOPT.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {IEEE},\n  note = {00022}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495290,"version":0},"$loki":1024},{"itemID":3397,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{gerla_picsonwheels_2013,\n  timestamp = {2019-03-27T23:14:50Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{San Diego, CA}},\n  title = {Pics-on-Wheels: {{Photo}} Surveillance in the Vehicular Cloud},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-5288-8 978-1-4673-5287-1 978-1-4673-5286-4},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6504250/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504250},\n  shorttitle = {Pics-on-Wheels},\n  abstract = {Cloud computing allows user to access remote hardware, data and software through the network.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their speciﬁc tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the inﬂux of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed “edge router” incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure conﬁdentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efﬁcacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-18},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {17-24},\n  author = {Jones, Tyler and Dali, Aniket and Rao, Manoj Ramesh and Biradar, Neha and Madassery, Jean and Liu, Kaikai},\n  file = {Jones et al_2018_Towards a Layered and Secure Internet-of-Things Testbed via Hybrid Mesh.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/LPZF5AGW/Jones et al_2018_Towards a Layered and Secure Internet-of-Things Testbed via Hybrid Mesh.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Mesh/WSN},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495406,"version":0},"$loki":1030},{"itemID":3438,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{selimi_blockchainenabled_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-12T11:46:28Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Munich, Germany}},\n  title = {Towards {{Blockchain}}-Enabled {{Wireless Mesh Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-5838-5},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3211933.3211936},\n  doi = {10.1145/3211933.3211936},\n  eventtitle = {The 1st {{Workshop}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 1st {{Workshop}} on {{Cryptocurrencies}} and {{Blockchains}} for {{Distributed Systems}}  - {{CryBlock}}'18},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {13-18},\n  author = {Selimi, Mennan and Kabbinale, Aniruddh Rao and Ali, Anwaar and Navarro, Leandro and Sathiaseelan, Arjuna},\n  file = {Selimi et al_2018_Towards Blockchain-enabled Wireless Mesh Networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/ERIYLWB5/Selimi et al_2018_Towards Blockchain-enabled Wireless Mesh Networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Network},\n  note = {00009}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495420,"version":0},"$loki":1031},{"itemID":3441,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{kabbinale_blockchain_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-31T14:00:35Z},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  eprint = {1811.04078},\n  primaryClass = {cs},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Blockchain for {{Economically Sustainable Wireless Mesh Networks}}},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04078},\n  abstract = {Decentralization, in the form mesh networking and blockchain, two promising technologies, is coming to the telecommunications industry.

However, there are some problems with the growth of the blockchain. The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction.

Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals. The results show our LoRa mesh networking module achieved a 88.49\\% packet delivery ratio (PDR), while the LoRaWAN in starnetwork topology was only 58.7\\% under the same conditions.},\n  eventtitle = {The 16th {{ACM}}/{{IEEE International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 16th {{ACM}}/{{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Information Processing}} in {{Sensor Networks}}  - {{IPSN}} '17},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {259-260},\n  keywords = {PDR},\n  author = {Ke, Kai-Hsiang and Liang, Qi-Wen and Zeng, Guan-Jie and Lin, Jun-Han and Lee, Huang-Chen},\n  file = {Ke et al_2017_A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-scale monitoring.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/MNV4WHIT/Ke et al_2017_A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-scale monitoring.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Mesh/WSN},\n  note = {00006}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495508,"version":0},"$loki":1036},{"itemID":3459,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{ochoa_evaluating_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T14:26:52Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Rome}},\n  title = {Evaluating {{LoRa}} Energy Efficiency for Adaptive Networks: {{From}} Star to Mesh Topologies},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-3839-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8115793/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115793},\n  shorttitle = {Evaluating {{LoRa}} Energy Efficiency for Adaptive Networks},\n  abstract = {The LoRa technology has emerged as an interesting solution for low power, long range IoT applications by proposing multiple ”degrees of freedom” at the physical layer.

In this paper, we analyze the ﬂexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio conﬁgurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio conﬁgurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2017-10},\n  pages = {1-8},\n  keywords = {Tx},\n  author = {Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Guizar, Arturo and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {Ochoa et al_2017_Evaluating LoRa energy efficiency for adaptive networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/FIVDZ6UT/Ochoa et al_2017_Evaluating LoRa energy efficiency for adaptive networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00016}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495534,"version":0},"$loki":1037},{"itemID":3461,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{farooq_operating_2011,\n  timestamp = {2019-03-27T23:14:46Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Operating {{Systems}} for {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  volume = {11},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/11/6/5900},\n  doi = {10.3390/s110605900},\n  shorttitle = {Operating {{Systems}} for {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {Sensors},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2011-05-31},\n  pages = {5900-5930},\n  author = {Farooq, Muhammad Omer and Kunz, Thomas},\n  file = {Farooq_Kunz_2011_Operating Systems for Wireless Sensor Networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/6E6T6QJ5/Farooq_Kunz_2011_Operating Systems for Wireless Sensor Networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Platform},\n  note = {00219}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495546,"version":0},"$loki":1038},{"itemID":3463,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{amjad_tinyosnew_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-03-28T08:51:24Z},\n  title = {{{TinyOS}}-{{New Trends}}, {{Comparative Views}}, and {{Supported Sensing Applications}}: {{A Review}}},\n  volume = {16},\n  issn = {1530-437X, 1558-1748, 2379-9153},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7387670/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JSEN.2016.2519924},\n  shorttitle = {{{TinyOS}}-{{New Trends}}, {{Comparative Views}}, and {{Supported Sensing Applications}}},\n  number = {9},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Sensors Journal},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2016-05},\n  pages = {2865-2889},\n  author = {Amjad, Muhammad and Sharif, Muhammad and Afzal, Muhammad Khalil and Kim, Sung Won},\n  file = {Amjad et al_2016_TinyOS-New Trends, Comparative Views, and Supported Sensing Applications.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/6YIM6WBX/Amjad et al_2016_TinyOS-New Trends, Comparative Views, and Supported Sensing Applications.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Tiny os},\n  note = {00071}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495558,"version":0},"$loki":1039},{"itemID":3465,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{ndiaye_software_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-22T14:24:37Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Software {{Defined Networking}} for {{Improved Wireless Sensor Network Management}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/5/1031},\n  doi = {10.3390/s17051031},\n  shorttitle = {Software {{Defined Networking}} for {{Improved Wireless Sensor Network Management}}},\n  number = {5},\n  journaltitle = {Sensors},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2017-05-04},\n  pages = {1031},\n  author = {Ndiaye, Musa and Hancke, Gerhard and Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan},\n  file = {Ndiaye et al_2017_Software Defined Networking for Improved Wireless Sensor Network Management.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/N6WNWL4G/Ndiaye et al_2017_Software Defined Networking for Improved Wireless Sensor Network Management.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {SDN/NFV},\n  note = {00058}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495572,"version":0},"$loki":1040},{"itemID":3474,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{_wireless_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-08T13:40:07Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Wireless {{Mesh Network}} -

In general, two main categories of networks are used in the IoT: short-range and long-range low-power networks. IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities.

However, each solution provides its own IoT infrastructure, devices, APIs, and data formats leading to interoperability issues. Such interoperability issues are the consequence of many critical issues such as vendor lock-in, impossibility to develop IoT application exposing cross-platform, and/or cross-domain, difficulty in plugging non-interoperable IoT devices into different IoT platforms, and ultimately prevents the emergence of IoT technology at a large-scale. To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together.

In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  urldate = {2019-02-14},\n  date = {2017-03-01},\n  pages = {74-84},\n  author = {Aloi, G. and Caliciuri, G. and Fortino, G. and Gravina, R. and Pace, P. and Russo, W. and Savaglio, C.},\n  file = {Aloi et al_2017_Enabling IoT interoperability through opportunistic smartphone-based mobile.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/L6P8YIFR/Aloi et al_2017_Enabling IoT interoperability through opportunistic smartphone-based mobile.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Gateway selection},\n  note = {00106}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628495774,"version":0},"$loki":1053},{"itemID":3603,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{wang_iot_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-13T10:46:18Z},\n  title = {{{IoT Security Model}} and {{Performance Evaluation}}: {{A Blockchain Approach}}},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525716},\n  shorttitle = {{{IoT Security Model}} and {{Performance Evaluation}}},\n  abstract = {It is a research hotspot that using blockchain technology to solve the security problems of the Internet of Things (IoT).

A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed.

Although SDN/OpenFlow is a relatively new area, it has attracted much attention from both academia and industry.

Hence, a set of unique predefined line commands and operating systems or firmware should be used. SDN (software-defined networking) is a structure designed for simplifying and improving network management with high flexibility by splitting control plane and data plane. Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities. Although SDN is regarded as a new research issue, it has attracted numerous researchers’ attention from both industrial and academic institutes. In this paper, data plane, control plane and application plane as the three planes of SDN and the interfaces between them such as OpenFlow are investigated and the challenges and the latest technologies in relation to SDN are examined.

Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, thus moving the control logic from the node to a central controller. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature. Moreover, it delves into some of the challenges facing this paradigm, as well as the major SDWSN design requirements that need to be considered to address these challenges.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {1872-1899},\n  author = {Kobo, H.

To alleviate such congestion while regulating the M2M devices’ opportunities to transmit, the Access Class Barring (ACB) process was proposed. In this article, we propose a novel implementation of the ACB mechanism in the context of multiple M2M traﬃc classes. Based on a scheduling algorithm, we have applied a PID controller to adjust dynamically multiple ACB factors related to each class category, guaranteeing a number of devices around an optimal value that maximizes the Random Access (RA) success probability.

The massive deployment of such devices may overwhelm the cellular network by imposing strong constraints on the Radio Access Network (RAN) because of the radio resources’ scarcity. As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would eﬃciently help to overcome the risk of congestion. In this paper, we proposed a novel ﬂuid model for M2M communications, which allows gaining an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of such systems. The provided analysis of the model was used to devise a new method to estimate accurately the number of M2M devices willing to connect as well as the number of random access attempts.We proposed, then, a novel implementation of the ACB process, which dynamically computes the ACB factor according to the network’s overload conditions while includes a corrective action adapting the controller action based on the mismatch existing between the computed and the targeted mean load. Compared to existing approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms allow improving considerably the estimation of the number of M2M devices’ arrivals, while outperforming existing techniques in terms of the number of abandons, the success and the collision probabilities, and the average access delay.},\n  eventtitle = {The 19th {{ACM International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 19th {{ACM International Conference}} on {{Modeling}}, {{Analysis}} and {{Simulation}} of {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Systems}} - {{MSWiM}} '16},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {287-291},\n  author = {Bouzouita, Meriam and Hadjadj-Aoul, Yassine and Zangar Tunisia, Nawel and Rubino, Gerardo and Tabbane, Sami},\n  file = {Bouzouita et al_2016_Dynamic Adaptive Access Barring Scheme For Heavily Congested M2M Networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/W7VBDTD4/Bouzouita et al_2016_Dynamic Adaptive Access Barring Scheme For Heavily Congested M2M Networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {3GPP},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496056,"version":0},"$loki":1075},{"itemID":3715,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{bouzouita_adaptive_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-08T13:33:41Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Messina, Italy}},\n  title = {Adaptive Access Protocol for Heavily Congested {{M2M}} Networks},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-0679-3},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7543886/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ISCC.2016.7543886},\n  abstract = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications are expected to be one of the major drivers of future cellular networks, due to a plethora of services provided to operators and consumers. This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion. One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances. Thus, we proposed, in this paper, a new method to estimate accurately the number of random access attempts in a way to measure efﬁciently the congestion level. Then, we proposed a novel implementation of the ACB process that mainly consists of dynamically adapting the ACB factor according to the network’s overload conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions by improving signiﬁcantly the access’s success probability while minimizing radio resources’ underutilization.

It represents a key component of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart spaces. One of the most difficult challenges to support M2M communications is their huge number compared to available radio resources. Hence, to deal with random access channel (RACH) overload and to better control the access in LTE-A Networks, the 3GPP proposed the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor concept. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve this method based on adaptive multiple ACB factors, according to M2M traffic category with respect to their access delay budget and drop rate (QoS parameters). Simulations were done for testing the effectiveness of our MACB scheme and show that using multiples ACB factors and dynamically adjusting them to the congestion level in addition to traffic type category increases the access probability and reduces overload. The obtained results were then compared to the basic ACB method and show that the access probability increases especially for high priority traffic.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer

est d’étendre l’Internet dans nos vies quotidiennes afin d’améliorer la qualité de vie des personnes, de sorte que le nombre d’appareils connectés et d’applications innovantes augmente très rapidement pour amener l’intelligence dans différents\nsecteurs comme la ville, le transport ou la santé. En 2020, les études affirment que les appareils connectés à Internet devraient compter entre 26 milliards et 50 milliards d’unités. [2, 3] La qualité de service d’application IoT dépend non seulement du réseau Internet et de l’infrastructure de communication, mais aussi du fonctionnement et des performances des appareils IoT. Par conséquent, les nouveaux paramètres de QoS tels que la précision des données et la disponibilité des appareils deviennent importants pour les applications IoT par rapport aux applications Internet. Le grand nombre de dispositifs et d’applications IoT connectés à Internet, et le flux de\ntrafic spontané entre eux rendent la gestion de la qualité de service complexe à travers l’infrastructure Internet. D’un autre côté, les dispositifs non-IP et leurs capacités limitées en termes d’énergie et de transmission créent l’environnement dynamique et contraint. De plus, l’interconnexion de bout en bout entre les dispositifs et les applications n’est pas possible. Aussi, les applications sont intéressées par les données collectées, pas à la source spécifique qui les produit. Le Software Defined Networking (SDN) est un nouveau paradigme pour les réseaux informatiques apparu récemment pour cacher la complexité de l’architecture de réseau traditionnelle (par exemple de l’Internet) et briser la fermeture des systèmes de réseau dans les fonctions de contrôle et de données. Il permet aux propriétaires et aux administrateurs de réseau de contrôler et de gérer le comportement du réseau par programme, en découplant le plan de contrôle du plan de données. SDN a le potentiel de révolutionner les réseaux informatiques\nclassiques existants, en offrant plusieurs avantages tels que la gestion centralisée, la programmabilité du réseau, l’efficacité des coûts d’exploitation, et les innovations. Dans cette thèse, nous étudions la gestion de ressources sur l’infrastructure IoT, y compris les réseaux de transport/Internet et de détection. Nous profitons de la technologie SDN comme le futur d’Internet pour offrir un système de support QoS flexible et adaptatif pour les services IoT. Nous présentons un intergiciel basé sur SDN pour définir un cadre de gestion de QoS pour gérer les besoins spécifiques de chaque application à travers l’infrastructure IoT. De plus, nous proposons un nouveau modèle QoS qui prend en compte les préférences de QoS\ndes applications et l’état des éléments de réseau pour allouer efficacement les ressources sur le réseau transport/Internet basé sur SDN tout en maximisant les performances du réseau.----------ABSTRACT: The Internet of Things (IoT) is an integration of various kinds of technologies, wherein heterogeneous objects with capabilities of sensing, actuation, communication, computation, networking, and storage are rapidly developed to collect the data for the users and applications. The IoT vision is to extend the Internet into our everyday lives, so the number of connected devices and innovative applications are growing very fast to bring intelligence into\nas many domains as possible. The QoS for IoT application not only depends on the Internet network and communication\ninfrastructure, it is also impacted by the operation and performance of IoT sensing infrastructure. Therefore, the new QoS parameters such as data accuracy, sampling rate, and\ndevice availability become important for the IoT applications compared to the Internet applications. The huge number of the Internet-connected IoT devices and application, and the spontaneous traffic flow among them make the management of the quality of service complex\nacross the Internet infrastructure. On the other hand, the non-IP devices and their limited capabilities in terms of energy and transmission create the dynamic environment and hinder the direct interaction between devices and applications. The quality of service is becoming one of the critical non-functional IoT element which needs research and studies. A flexible and scalable QoS management mechanism must be implemented in IoT system to keep up with the growth rate of the Internet-connected IoT devices and applications as well as their heterogeneity and diversity. The solution should address the IoT application requirements and user satisfaction while considering the system dynamism, limitations, and characteristics. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networking which separates the control plane and the data plane of the network elements. It makes the network\nelements programmable via the centralized control plane. This approach enables more agile management and control over the network behavior. In this thesis, we take advantage of SDN technology as the future of the Internet to offer a\nflexible and adaptive QoS support scheme for the IoT services. We present an SDN-based middleware to define a QoS management framework to manage the application specific QoS\nneeds across the IoT infrastructure including transport and sensing network. Also, we propose a new QoS model that takes into account the application QoS preferences and the network\nelements status to allocate effectively the resources for the applications across SDN network while maximizing network performance.},\n  institution = {{École Polytechnique de Montréal}},\n  type = {masters},\n  urldate = {2019-04-11},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  author = {Meshinchi, Atefeh},\n  file = {Meshinchi_2018_QOS-Aware and Status-Aware Adaptive Resource Allocation Framework in SDN-Based.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/BNHZ9XGG/Meshinchi_2018_QOS-Aware and Status-Aware Adaptive Resource Allocation Framework in SDN-Based.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Untitled},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496256,"version":0},"$loki":1094},{"itemID":3803,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@phdthesis{drissi_multi_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:34:18Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Multi Criteria Real Time Network Selection Framework}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Environment}} for {{5G}} Systems: {{Application}} for {{Mobile}} and {{Vehicular Heterogeneous Networks}}},\n  url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01872986/document},\n  shorttitle = {A {{Multi Criteria Real Time Network Selection Framework}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Environment}} for {{5G}} Systems},\n  abstract = {Network selection receives considerable attention from communication networks researchers. This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the offered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of e ciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for different multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of different parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study. In the first part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user's preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario. We also improve the latter solution by proposing a network selection algorithm that provides a load balancing technique based on matching game theory to overcome network overload conditions in high-speed scenarios. In the second part, the performance study has been evaluated for two scenario types: Cellular and Vehicular. The proposed algorithms were evaluated and validated in both mobile and vehicular environments using the NS3 simulator.},\n  institution = {{Université Mohammed V - Rabat}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2017-10-21},\n  keywords = {Game,*},\n  author = {Drissi, M.},\n  file = {Drissi_2017_A Multi Criteria Real Time Network Selection Framework in Heterogeneous.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/ZI97W7CU/Drissi_2017_A Multi Criteria Real Time Network Selection Framework in Heterogeneous.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Network selection},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496276,"version":0},"$loki":1095},{"itemID":3806,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{bari_automated_2007,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:35:27Z},\n  title = {Automated Network Selection in a Heterogeneous Wireless Network Environment},\n  volume = {21},\n  issn = {0890-8044},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4107918/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MNET.2007.314536},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Network},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2007-01},\n  pages = {34-40},\n  keywords = {*},\n  author = {Bari, Farooq and Leung, Victor},\n  file = {Bari_Leung_2007_Automated network selection in a heterogeneous wireless network environment.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/SM8ZITCD/Bari_Leung_2007_Automated network selection in a heterogeneous wireless network environment.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Network selection},\n  note = {00282}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496290,"version":0},"$loki":1096},{"itemID":3808,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{qingyangsong_network_2005,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:34:29Z},\n  location = {{Seoul, Korea}},\n  title = {A Network Selection Mechanism for next Generation Networks},\n  volume = {2},\n  isbn = {978-0-7803-8938-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1494578/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICC.2005.1494578},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}}, 2005. {{ICC}} 2005. 2005},\n  booktitle = {{{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}}, 2005. {{ICC}} 2005. 2005},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2005},\n  pages = {1418-1422},\n  keywords = {*},\n  author = {{Qingyang Song} and Jamalipour, A.},\n  file = {Qingyang Song_Jamalipour_2005_A network selection mechanism for next generation networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/I5RKEB5Z/Qingyang Song_Jamalipour_2005_A network selection mechanism for next generation networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Network selection},\n  note = {00352}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496302,"version":0},"$loki":1097},{"itemID":3810,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{niyato_dynamics_2009,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T14:41:07Z},\n  title = {Dynamics of {{Network Selection}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Networks}}: {{An Evolutionary Game Approach}}},\n  volume = {58},\n  issn = {0018-9545, 1939-9359},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4607241/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TVT.2008.2004588},\n  shorttitle = {Dynamics of {{Network Selection}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Networks}}},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2009-05},\n  pages = {2008-2017},\n  keywords = {BW},\n  author = {Niyato, D. and Hossain, E.},\n  file = {Niyato_Hossain_2009_Dynamics of Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/CH2MN45V/Niyato_Hossain_2009_Dynamics of Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Network selection},\n  note = {00405}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496312,"version":0},"$loki":1098},{"itemID":3818,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{helou_radio_2013,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-14T15:20:33Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Lyon, France}},\n  title = {Radio Access Selection Approaches in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-0428-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6673408/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WiMOB.2013.6673408},\n  abstract = {Along with the rapid growth of mobile broadband trafﬁc, multiple radio access technologies (RATs) are being integrated and jointly managed. To optimize heterogeneous network performance, efﬁcient Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM) mechanisms need to be deﬁned. This paper tackles the access technology selection — a key CRRM functionality — and proposes a hybrid approach that combines beneﬁts from both network-centric and user-centric methods. Network information, that is periodically broadcasted, assists mobile users in their decisions. By broadcasting appropriate decisional information, the network tries to globally control users decision in a way to meet operator objectives. On the other hand, mobiles also integrate their needs and preferences to select their access technology so as to maximize their own utility. In comparison with other RAT selection techniques, including network-centric, hybrid and user-centric methods, simulation results prove the efﬁciency of our hybrid approach in enhancing resource utilization and maximizing user satisfaction.},\n  eventtitle = {2013 {{IEEE}} 9th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2013 {{IEEE}} 9th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-14},\n  date = {2013-10},\n  pages = {521-528},\n  author = {Helou, Melhem El and Ibrahim, Marc and Lahoud, Samer and Khawam, Kinda},\n  file = {Helou et al. - 2013 - Radio access selection approaches in heterogeneous.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/HG9H96IA/Helou et al. - 2013 - Radio access selection approaches in heterogeneous.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Network selection},\n  note = {00013}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496328,"version":0},"$loki":1099},{"itemID":3819,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{wenhuizhang_handover_2004,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:36:10Z},\n  location = {{Atlanta, GA, USA}},\n  title = {Handover Decision Using Fuzzy {{MADM}} in Heterogeneous Networks},\n  isbn = {978-0-7803-8344-9},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1311263/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WCNC.2004.1311263},\n  eventtitle = {2004 {{IEEE Wireless Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {2004 {{IEEE Wireless Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{IEEE Cat}}. {{No}}.{{04TH8733}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-14},\n  date = {2004},\n  pages = {653-658},\n  keywords = {*},\n  author = {{Wenhui Zhang}},\n  file = {Wenhui Zhang - 2004 - Handover decision using fuzzy MADM in heterogeneou.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/LN3E74FF/Wenhui Zhang - 2004 - Handover decision using fuzzy MADM in heterogeneou.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Network selection},\n  note = {00487}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496340,"version":0},"$loki":1100},{"itemID":3826,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{dhar_network_2007,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:36:50Z},\n  location = {{Allahabad, India}},\n  title = {Network {{Selection}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Environment}}: {{A Ranking Algorithm}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4244-1877-0 978-1-4244-1878-7},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4475744/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WCSN.2007.4475744},\n  shorttitle = {Network {{Selection}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Environment}}},\n  eventtitle = {2007 {{Third International Conference}} on {{Wireless Communication}} and {{Sensor Networks}}},\n  booktitle = {2007 {{Third International Conference}} on {{Wireless Communication}} and {{Sensor Networks}}},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-14},\n  date = {2007-12},\n  pages = {41-44},\n  keywords = {*},\n  author = {Dhar, Joydip and Ravi, Kiran S and Yashwanth, Reddy K},\n  file = {Dhar et al_2007_Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Environment.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/BYYWAFB4/Dhar et al_2007_Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Environment.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Network selection},\n  note = {00019}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496352,"version":0},"$loki":1101},{"itemID":3836,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{bloessl_performance_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-15T13:05:31Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Performance {{Assessment}} of {{IEEE}} 802.11p with an {{Open Source SDR}}-{{Based Prototype}}},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {1536-1233},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8031977/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TMC.2017.2751474},\n  abstract = {We present a complete simulation and experimentation framework for IEEE 802.11p.

Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modiﬁed. Finally, it enables a seamless switch between simulations and experiments and, thus, helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users’ complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufﬁcient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great inﬂuences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper ﬁrst deﬁnes the SFSD and describes the important inﬂuences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artiﬁcial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  urldate = {2019-04-27},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {39895-39906},\n  keywords = {*},\n  author = {Min, Xunyou and Xu, Xiaofei and Liu, Zhizhong and Chu, Dianhui and Wang, Zhongjie},\n  file = {Min et al. - 2018 - An Approach to Resource and QoS-Aware Services Opt.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/I8KMID9I/Min et al. - 2018 - An Approach to Resource and QoS-Aware Services Opt.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Applications},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496590,"version":0},"$loki":1131},{"itemID":3992,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@misc{_1libelium_,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-23T15:18:39Z},\n  title = {1-{{LIBELIUM}}},\n  file = {waspmote_lora_868mhz_915mhz_sx1272_networking_guide.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/UCRJZKHD/waspmote_lora_868mhz_915mhz_sx1272_networking_guide.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Specification},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496596,"version":0},"$loki":1132},{"itemID":3994,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{rosmiati_air_2019,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-29T14:21:03Z},\n  langid = {american},\n  title = {Air Pollution Monitoring System Using {{LoRa}} Modul as Transceiver System},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {2302-9293},\n  url = {http://journal.uad.ac.id/index.php/TELKOMNIKA/article/view/11760},\n  abstract = {Air pollution is a disaster that can indirectly interfere with human health, Indonesia is the third highest country in the world that has pollution levels, one of the types of pollution that threatens public health is the increase of CO, NO2 and SO2 level in the air.

This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance. Last, the application parameters required by the smart energy scenario influence LoRa performance, but their impacts have been scarcely reported. Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that considers performance issues when establishing a LoRa network on a real-world application testbed.},\n  number = {7},\n  journaltitle = {Sustainability},\n  shortjournal = {Sustainability},\n  urldate = {2019-04-29},\n  date = {2019-03-30},\n  pages = {1917},\n  keywords = {Tx},\n  author = {Kim, Dong-Hoon and Lee, Eun-Kyu and Kim, Jibum},\n  file = {Kim et al_2019_Experiencing LoRa Network Establishment on a Smart Energy Campus Testbed.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/6Z6NW5T7/Kim et al_2019_Experiencing LoRa Network Establishment on a Smart Energy Campus Testbed.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Measurement},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496638,"version":0},"$loki":1134},{"itemID":4001,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{paredes-parra_alternative_2019,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-02T10:03:30Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An {{Alternative Internet}}-of-{{Things Solution Based}} on {{LoRa}} for {{PV Power Plants}}: {{Data Monitoring}} and {{Management}}},\n  volume = {12},\n  issn = {1996-1073},\n  url = {https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/5/881},\n  doi = {10.3390/en12050881},\n  shorttitle = {An {{Alternative Internet}}-of-{{Things Solution Based}} on {{LoRa}} for {{PV Power Plants}}},\n  abstract = {This paper proposes a wireless low-cost solution based on long-range (LoRa) technologyable to communicate with remote PV power plants, covering long distances with minimum powerconsumption and maintenance.

The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa conﬁguration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa conﬁguration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the trafﬁc intensity. The comparison shows the beneﬁts of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its conﬁguration according to its link budget.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-30},\n  date = {2018-10},\n  pages = {192-199},\n  author = {Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Suraty, Luiz and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {Ochoa et al. - 2018 - Large Scale LoRa Networks From Homogeneous to Het.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/CN8P8U28/Ochoa et al. - 2018 - Large Scale LoRa Networks From Homogeneous to Het.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496724,"version":0},"$loki":1140},{"itemID":4026,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{piyare_ondemand_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:16:37Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Limassol}},\n  title = {On-{{Demand TDMA}} for {{Energy Efficient Data Collection}} with {{LoRa}} and {{Wake}}-up {{Receiver}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-6876-4},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8589151/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WiMOB.2018.8589151},\n  abstract = {Low-power and long-range communication technologies such as LoRa are becoming popular in IoT applications due to their ability to cover kilometers range with milliwatt of power consumption. One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the trafﬁc congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efﬁcient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa. Experimental results show a data reliability of 100 \\% and a round-trip latency on the order of milliseconds with end devices dissipating less than 46 mJ when active and 1.83 µW during periods of inactivity, lasting up to 3 years on a 1200 mA h Lithium battery.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-30},\n  date = {2018-10},\n  pages = {1-4},\n  keywords = {Tx},\n  author = {Piyare, Rajeev and Murphy, Amy L. and Magno, Michele and Benini, Luca},\n  file = {Piyare et al. - 2018 - On-Demand TDMA for Energy Efficient Data Collectio.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/AQ2TCM59/Piyare et al. - 2018 - On-Demand TDMA for Energy Efficient Data Collectio.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Measurement},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628496738,"version":0},"$loki":1141},{"itemID":4030,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{mekki_comparative_2019,\n  timestamp = {2019-04-30T09:59:13Z},\n  title = {A Comparative Study of {{LPWAN}} Technologies for Large-Scale {{IoT}} Deployment},\n  volume = {5},\n  issn = {2405-9595},\n  url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405959517302953},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.icte.2017.12.005},\n  abstract = {By 2020, more than 50 billion devices will be connected through radio communications.

coverage by utilizing the direct device-to-device (D2D) links to construct a multi-hop relay network. In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches.

Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler’s objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T . To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T . This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward “variation” and the minimal achievable regret, and by establishing a connection between the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},\n  booktitle = {{{NIPS}}},\n  date = {2014},\n  author = {Gur, Yonatan and Zeevi, Assaf J. and Besbes, Omar},\n  file = {Gur et al_2014_Stochastic Multi-Armed-Bandit Problem with Non-stationary Rewards.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/USD3V3PR/Gur et al_2014_Stochastic Multi-Armed-Bandit Problem with Non-stationary Rewards.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Bandit},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497038,"version":0},"$loki":1174},{"itemID":4149,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{allesiardo_nonstationary_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T01:02:09Z},\n  title = {The Non-Stationary Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit Problems},\n  volume = {3},\n  doi = {10.1007/s41060-017-0050-5},\n  abstract = {We consider a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit with K arms where the rewards are not assumed to be identically distributed, but are generated by a non-stationary stochastic process.

For both settings, we target problem-dependent bounds, instead of the more conservative problem-free bounds. We consider two classical problems: (1) identify a best arm with high probability (best arm identification), for which the performance measure by the sample complexity (number of samples before finding a near-optimal arm). To this end, we naturally extend the definition of sample complexity so that it makes sense in the switching best arm setting, which may be of independent interest. (2) Achieve the smallest cumulative regret (regret minimization) where the regret is measured with respect to the strategy pulling an arm with the best instantaneous mean at each step.},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Data Science and Analytics},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {267-283},\n  keywords = {regret},\n  author = {Allesiardo, Robin and Féraud, Raphaël and Maillard, Odalric-Ambrym},\n  file = {Allesiardo et al_2017_The non-stationary stochastic multi-armed bandit problem.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/DLFMYTZ5/Allesiardo et al_2017_The non-stationary stochastic multi-armed bandit problem.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Bandit},\n  note = {00012}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497050,"version":0},"$loki":1175},{"itemID":4175,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{rizzi_evaluation_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T14:13:27Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Evaluation of the {{IoT LoRaWAN Solution}} for {{Distributed Measurement Applications}}},\n  volume = {66},\n  issn = {0018-9456, 1557-9662},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8036410/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TIM.2017.2746378},\n  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is based on data collection, where billions of sensors sample the real world; in other words, the IoT includes a giant distributed measurement system.

In this paper the use of a LoRa technology, originally developed for IoT, is investigated with the aim of implementing distributed measurement systems. After the conclusion that LoRa (Long Range) and LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network) architectures show a good match with measurement systems, the paper focuses on the characterization of time related performance indicators that are important for distributed systems.

Existing protocols are based on simplistic heuristics that often approach interference problems (i.e., packet loss, delay and energy waste) by increasing power, leading to detrimental results. The scope of this work is to investigate how machine learning may be used to bring wireless nodes to the lowest possible transmission power level and, in turn, to respect the quality requirements of the overall network. Lowering transmission power has beneﬁts in terms of both energy consumption and interference. We propose a protocol of transmission power control through a reinforcement learning process that we have set in a multi-agent system. The agents are independent learners using the same exploration strategy and reward structure, leading to an overall cooperative network. The simulation results show that the system converges to an equilibrium where each node transmits at the minimum power while respecting high packet reception ratio constraints. Consequently, the system beneﬁts from low energy consumption and packet delay.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Sensors},\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2018-01-27},\n  pages = {375},\n  author = {Chincoli, Michele and Liotta, Antonio},\n  file = {Chincoli and Liotta - 2018 - Self-Learning Power Control in Wireless Sensor Net.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/G6JTECZ2/Chincoli and Liotta - 2018 - Self-Learning Power Control in Wireless Sensor Net.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00017}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497070,"version":0},"$loki":1177},{"itemID":4188,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{mikhaylov_analysis_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:43:14Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Analysis of {{Capacity}} and {{Scalability}} of the {{LoRa Low Power Wide Area Network Technology}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper we discuss and analyze the recently proposed LoRa low power wide area network (LPWAN) technology when used under the European frequency regulations.

The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufﬁcient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2016-11},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  keywords = {SF},\n  author = {Reynders, Brecht and Pollin, Sofie},\n  file = {Reynders and Pollin - 2016 - Chirp spread spectrum as a modulation technique fo.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/WMB5B87Q/Reynders and Pollin - 2016 - Chirp spread spectrum as a modulation technique fo.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Measurement},\n  note = {00051}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497090,"version":0},"$loki":1179},{"itemID":4197,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{bankov_limits_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:52:22Z},\n  title = {On the {{Limits}} of {{LoRaWAN Channel Access}}},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {5},\n  keywords = {ToA,DS},\n  author = {Bankov, Dmitry and Khorov, Evgeny and Lyakhov, Andrey},\n  file = {Bankov et al. - On the Limits of LoRaWAN Channel Access.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/V7PYRCSH/Bankov et al. - On the Limits of LoRaWAN Channel Access.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Measurement},\n  note = {00068}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497098,"version":0},"$loki":1180},{"itemID":4198,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{toussaint_performance_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:16:45Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Vancouver, BC, Canada}},\n  title = {Performance Analysis of the On-the-Air Activation in {{LoRaWAN}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-0996-1},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7746082/},\n  doi = {10.1109/IEMCON.2016.7746082},\n  abstract = {Long-range low-power communications are starting to replace short-range low-power communications in monitoring applications based on wireless sensor networks, both in rural and urban environments, due to the small deployment cost of long-range technologies.

When considering the contention between nodes and interference between different networks, simulations show that adaptation of frequency and modulation is imperative for efﬁciently dealing with varying contention and interference in long range unlicensed networks.

With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traﬃc very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related speciﬁcally to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions.

To validate the module, we compare its results with measurements on a real-world testbed and with measured values reported by other work. We also show that the module correctly represents the capture effect that lowers the packet drop rate due to collisions. Second, we want to improve the performance of LoRa devices while not impacting energy consumption, the aspect that usually is not taken into account in the literature. We use the simulator to evaluate CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), a simple enhancement to LoRaWAN that lowers the collision ratio. The simulation results show that CSMA considerably lowers the collision ratio while only slightly increasing energy consumption. We also observe that CSMA presents lower energy consumption than LoRa for a large number of devices. Another advantage of CSMA consists of increased throughput and larger network capacity because the ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle do not longer apply.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}} 2018)},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-13},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  pages = {1-7},\n  keywords = {PDR,Tx},\n  author = {To, Thanh-Hai and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {To and Duda - 2018 - Simulation of LoRa in NS-3 Improving LoRa Perform.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/SSLB3I38/To and Duda - 2018 - Simulation of LoRa in NS-3 Improving LoRa Perform.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Measurement},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497218,"version":0},"$loki":1188},{"itemID":4318,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{jetmirhaxhibeqiri_lora_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:38:32Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{LoRa Scalability}}: {{A Simulation Model Based}} on {{Interference Measurements}}},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/6/1193},\n  doi = {10.3390/s17061193},\n  shorttitle = {{{LoRa Scalability}}},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {Sensors},\n  urldate = {2019-05-13},\n  date = {2017-05-23},\n  pages = {1193},\n  keywords = {PDR,SIR,SF,BW},\n  author = {{Jetmir Haxhibeqiri} and {Floris Van den Abeele} and {Ingrid Moerman} and {Jeroen Hoebeke}},\n  file = {Jetmir Haxhibeqiri et al_2017_LoRa Scalability.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/KEMGJ6IM/Jetmir Haxhibeqiri et al_2017_LoRa Scalability.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Measurement},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497228,"version":0},"$loki":1189},{"itemID":4321,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{blenn_lorawan_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T14:37:09Z},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  eprint = {1706.03086},\n  primaryClass = {cs},\n  title = {{{LoRaWAN}} in the {{Wild}}: {{Measurements}} from {{The Things Network}}},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03086},\n  shorttitle = {{{LoRaWAN}} in the {{Wild}}},\n  abstract = {The Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) specification was released in 2015, primarily to support the Internet-of-Things by facilitating wireless communication over long distances.

due to their advantages in terms of low cost, energy efﬁciency and range. Although LPWANs attract the interest of industry and network operators, it faces certain constraints related to energy consumption, network coverage and quality of service. In this paper we demonstrate the possibility to optimize the performance of the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, one of the most widely used LPWAN technology. We suggest that nodes use light-weight learning methods, namely, multi-armed bandit algorithms, to select the communication parameters (spreading factor and emission power). Extensive simulations show that such learning methods allow to manage the trade-off between energy consumption and packet loss much better than an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm adapting spreading factors and transmission powers on the basis of Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) values.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-13},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {521-526},\n  author = {Kerkouche, Raouf and Alami, Reda and Feraud, Raphael and Varsier, Nadege and Maille, Patrick},\n  file = {Kerkouche et al. - 2018 - Node-based optimization of LoRa transmissions with.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/IJREFCP4/Kerkouche et al. - 2018 - Node-based optimization of LoRa transmissions with.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Bandit},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497366,"version":0},"$loki":1197},{"itemID":4350,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{temglit_distributed_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-14T14:25:06Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Distributed Agent}}-{{Based Approach}} for {{Optimal QoS Selection}} in {{Web}} of {{Object Choreography}}},\n  volume = {12},\n  issn = {1932-8184, 1937-9234, 2373-7816},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7827995/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JSYST.2016.2647281},\n  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the domain of physical/logical objects connected to the Internet that can be accessible anywhere and anytime, giving the access policies. Web objects and services can be seen as distributed and cooperative agents that need to collaborate in order to reach advanced functionalities and also to optimize the overall quality offered to the end users. However, the number of the services that can be supplied through these devices on the Internet will increase more and more. In this context, performing the composition and selection of the best services according to quality-of-service (QoS) criteria become a complex task, especially when dealing with global service selection to satisfy global constraints of users in decentralized environments. For this purpose, we propose a distributed and optimal QoS selection approach based on the multiagent paradigm and the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) formalism. Hence, we revisited a DCOP technique for developing an efﬁcient algorithm: the DPOP4QoS implemented under a real-time Web protocol for IoT communication, the extensible messaging and presence protocol. The proposed algorithm takes into account the speciﬁcities of the service composition context and the satisfaction of the global user constraints. This paper also presents a set of experiments conducted under realistic distributed environment to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Systems Journal},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {1655-1666},\n  author = {Temglit, Nacera and Chibani, Abdelghani and Djouani, Karim and Nacer, Mohamed Ahmed},\n  file = {Temglit et al. - 2018 - A Distributed Agent-Based Approach for Optimal QoS.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/W9GQTLIS/Temglit et al. - 2018 - A Distributed Agent-Based Approach for Optimal QoS.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Applications},\n  note = {00007}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497386,"version":0},"$loki":1198},{"itemID":4354,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{george_coordinateur_2019,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-31T14:28:32Z},\n  langid = {french},\n  title = {Coordinateur scientifique},\n  date = {2019},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {George, Laurent},\n  file = {George - Coordinateur scientifique.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/BM9XN8QH/George - Coordinateur scientifique.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {ESIEE/ECE},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497392,"version":0},"$loki":1199},{"itemID":4367,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{chen_every_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-14T15:18:32Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Every {{Second Counts}}: {{Integrating Edge Computing}} and {{Service Oriented Architecture}} for {{Automatic Emergency Management}}},\n  volume = {2018},\n  issn = {0197-6729, 2042-3195},\n  url = {https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jat/2018/7592926/},\n  doi = {10.1155/2018/7592926},\n  shorttitle = {Every {{Second Counts}}},\n  abstract = {Emergency management has long been recognized as a social challenge due to the criticality of the response time. In emergency situations such as severe traffic accidents, minimizing the response time, which requires close collaborations between all stakeholders involved and distributed intelligence support, leads to greater survival chance of the injured. However, the current response system is far from efficient, despite the rapid development of information and communication technologies. This paper presents an automated collaboration framework for emergency management that coordinates all stakeholders within the emergency response system and fully automates the rescue process. Applying the concept of multiaccess edge computing architecture, as well as choreography of the service oriented architecture, the system allows seamless coordination between multiple organizations in a distributed way through standard web services. A service choreography is designed to globally model the emergency management process from the time an accident occurs until the rescue is finished. The choreography can be synthesized to generate detailed specification on peer-to-peer interaction logic, and then the specification can be enacted and deployed on cloud infrastructures.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {1-13},\n  author = {Chen, Lei and Englund, Cristofer},\n  file = {Chen_Englund_2018_Every Second Counts.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/XUFTNMVT/Chen_Englund_2018_Every Second Counts.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Choregraphie},\n  note = {00007}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497406,"version":0},"$loki":1200},{"itemID":4375,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{chen_choreographing_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-29T05:50:12Z},\n  location = {{Sydney, NSW}},\n  title = {Choreographing {{Services}} for {{Smart Cities}}: {{Smart Traffic Demonstration}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-5932-4},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8108625/},\n  doi = {10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108625},\n  shorttitle = {Choreographing {{Services}} for {{Smart Cities}}},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 85th {{Vehicular Technology Conference}} ({{VTC Spring}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 85th {{Vehicular Technology Conference}} ({{VTC Spring}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  author = {Chen, Lei and Englund, Cristofer},\n  file = {Chen_Englund_2017_Choreographing Services for Smart Cities.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/V3GQ7MY2/Chen_Englund_2017_Choreographing Services for Smart Cities.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Choregraphie},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497420,"version":0},"$loki":1201},{"itemID":4378,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{duhart_resource_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:33:26Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Resource Oriented Framework}} for {{Service Choreography}} over {{Wireless Sensor}} and {{Actor Networks}}},\n  volume = {23},\n  issn = {1068-9605, 1572-8129},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10776-016-0316-1},\n  doi = {10.1007/s10776-016-0316-1},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Wireless Information Networks},\n  shortjournal = {Int J Wireless Inf Networks},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2016-09},\n  pages = {173-186},\n  keywords = {**},\n  author = {Duhart, Clément and Sauvage, Pierre and Bertelle, Cyrille},\n  file = {Duhart et al_2016_A Resource Oriented Framework for Service Choreography over Wireless Sensor and.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/A72SCUID/Duhart et al_2016_A Resource Oriented Framework for Service Choreography over Wireless Sensor and.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Choregraphie},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497430,"version":0},"$loki":1202},{"itemID":4380,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{parsa_goaldriven_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-14T15:27:32Z},\n  location = {{Tehran, Iran}},\n  title = {Towards a Goal-Driven Method for Web Service Choreography Validation},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-2166-6},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7498448/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICWR.2016.7498448},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{Second International Conference}} on {{Web Research}} ({{ICWR}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{Second International Conference}} on {{Web Research}} ({{ICWR}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2016-04},\n  pages = {66-71},\n  author = {Parsa, Saeed and Ebrahimifard, Amir and Amiri, Mohammad Javad and Arani, Mostafa Khoramabadi},\n  file = {Parsa et al_2016_Towards a goal-driven method for web service choreography validation.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/7AZPAE4Y/Parsa et al_2016_Towards a goal-driven method for web service choreography validation.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Choregraphie},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497454,"version":0},"$loki":1203},{"itemID":4394,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@incollection{gomes_modelbased_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-31T14:00:18Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Cham}},\n  title = {A {{Model}}-{{Based Approach}} for the {{Pragmatic Deployment}} of {{Service Choreographies}}},\n  volume = {567},\n  isbn = {978-3-319-33312-0 978-3-319-33313-7},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-33313-7_11},\n  abstract = {The development of applications using service choreographies is becoming one of the de facto standards for the Future Internet. However QoS-aware management of service compositions is usually performed without considering service sharing. This simplifying assumption makes choreography deployment less feasible in real scenarios, in which a single service is typically shared in many scenarios. In this paper we discuss the problem of managing multiple choreographies in multi-cloud environments and we advocate that sharing-aware deployment is a more eﬀective and resource-eﬃcient approach. We propose a model for the combined deployment of multiple choreographies on top of a shared set of services, and we further investigate the problem through experiments.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Service}}-{{Oriented}} and {{Cloud Computing}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {153-165},\n  author = {Gomes, Raphael and Lima, Júnio and Costa, Fábio and da Rocha, Ricardo and Georgantas, Nikolaos},\n  editor = {Celesti, Antonio and Leitner, Philipp},\n  options = {useprefix=true},\n  file = {Gomes et al. -

In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a network selection scheme, which is for users that select an optimal network with best comprehensive performance between different types of networks. However, the optimal network may be not the most reasonable one due to compensation of MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making), and the network is called pseudo-optimal network. This paper conducts a performance evaluation of a number of widely used MADM-based methods for network selection that aim to keep the mobile users always best connected anywhere and anytime, where subjective weight and objective weight are all considered. The performance analysis shows that the selection scheme based on MEW (weighted multiplicative method) and combination weight can better avoid accessing pseudo-optimal network for balancing network load and reducing ping-pong effect in comparison with three other MADM solutions.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  author = {Zhou, Jian and Zhu, Can-yan},\n  file = {Zhou_Zhu_2016_Compensatory Analysis and Optimization for MADM for Heterogeneous Wireless.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/INK55447/Zhou_Zhu_2016_Compensatory Analysis and Optimization for MADM for Heterogeneous Wireless.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Network selection},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497540,"version":0},"$loki":1210},{"itemID":4415,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@incollection{ruckebusch_dynamic_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:23:46Z},\n  location = {{Cham}},\n  title = {Dynamic {{Reconfiguration}} of {{Network Protocols}} for {{Constrained Internet}}-of-{{Things Devices}}},\n  volume = {170},\n  isbn = {978-3-319-47074-0 978-3-319-47075-7},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-47075-7_31},\n  booktitle = {Internet of {{Things}}. {{IoT Infrastructures}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {269-281},\n  keywords = {Delay,Tx},\n  author = {Ruckebusch, Peter and Van Damme, Jo and De Poorter, Eli and Moerman, Ingrid},\n  editor = {Mandler, Benny and Marquez-Barja, Johann and Mitre Campista, Miguel Elias and Cagáňová, Dagmar and Chaouchi, Hakima and Zeadally, Sherali and Badra, Mohamad and Giordano, Stefano and Fazio, Maria and Somov, Andrey and Vieriu, Radu-Laurentiu},\n  file = {Ruckebusch et al_2016_Dynamic Reconfiguration of Network Protocols for Constrained Internet-of-Things.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/3QIUEV7I/Ruckebusch et al_2016_Dynamic Reconfiguration of Network Protocols for Constrained Internet-of-Things.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497556,"version":0},"$loki":1211},{"itemID":4417,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{samie_distributed_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:36:01Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Distributed {{Trade}}-{{Based Edge Device Management}} in {{Multi}}-{{Gateway IoT}}},\n  volume = {2},\n  issn = {2378962X},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3232714.3134842},\n  doi = {10.1145/3134842},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems},\n  shortjournal = {ACM Trans.

However, traditional wireless networks are designed with network-centric approaches where different networks have different quality of service (QoS) strategies and cannot easily cooperate with each other to serve network users. Massive network infrastructures could not assure users perceived network and service quality, which is an indisputable fact. To address this issue, we design a new framework for heterogeneous wireless networks with the principle of user-centricity, refactoring the network from users’ perspective to suffice their requirements and preferences. Different from network-centric approaches, the proposed framework takes advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and virtualization technology, which will bring better perceived services quality for wireless network users. In the proposed user-centric framework, control plane and data plane are decoupled to manage the HetNets in a flexible and coadjutant way, and resource virtualization technology is introduced to abstract physical resources of HetNets into unified virtualized resources. Hence, ubiquitous and undifferentiated network connectivity and QoE (quality of experience) driven fine-grained resource management could be achieved for wireless network users.},\n  journaltitle = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  keywords = {BW},\n  author = {Lu, Zhaoming and Lei, Tao and Wen, Xiangming and Wang, Luhan and Chen, Xin},\n  file = {Lu et al_2016_SDN Based User-Centric Framework for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/6NQXK2A6/Lu et al_2016_SDN Based User-Centric Framework for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Untitled},\n  note = {00004}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497602,"version":0},"$loki":1214},{"itemID":4438,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{cuomo_trafficoriented_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:16:03Z},\n  location = {{Capri}},\n  title = {Towards Traffic-Oriented Spreading Factor Allocations in {{LoRaWAN}} Systems},\n  isbn = {978-3-903176-05-8},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8407091/},\n  doi = {10.23919/MedHocNet.2018.8407091},\n  eventtitle = {2018 17th {{Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop}} ({{Med}}-{{Hoc}}-{{Net}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 17th {{Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop}} ({{Med}}-{{Hoc}}-{{Net}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-18},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {1-8},\n  keywords = {SF},\n  author = {Cuomo, Francesca and Gamez, Julio Cesar Carrasquel and Maurizio, Antonio and Scipione, Laura and Campo, Manuel and Caponi, Alberto and Bianchi, Giuseppe and Rossini, Giampaolo and Pisani, Patrizio},\n  file = {Cuomo et al_2018_Towards traffic-oriented spreading factor allocations in LoRaWAN systems.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/9JLIVWCZ/Cuomo et al_2018_Towards traffic-oriented spreading factor allocations in LoRaWAN systems.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497616,"version":0},"$loki":1215},{"itemID":4440,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{korbi_lorawan_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:15:38Z},\n  location = {{Cambridge, MA}},\n  title = {{{LoRaWAN Analysis Under Unsaturated Traffic}}, {{Orthogonal}} and {{Non}}-{{Orthogonal Spreading Factor Conditions}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-7659-2},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8548056/},\n  doi = {10.1109/NCA.2018.8548056},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Symposium}} on {{Network Computing}} and {{Applications}} ({{NCA}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Symposium}} on {{Network Computing}} and {{Applications}} ({{NCA}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-18},\n  date = {2018-11},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  keywords = {SF},\n  author = {Korbi, Ines EI and Ghamri-Doudane, Yacine and Saidane, Leila Azouz},\n  file = {Korbi et al_2018_LoRaWAN Analysis Under Unsaturated Traffic, Orthogonal and Non-Orthogonal.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/7UHYKYFY/Korbi et al_2018_LoRaWAN Analysis Under Unsaturated Traffic, Orthogonal and Non-Orthogonal.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Measurement},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497630,"version":0},"$loki":1216},{"itemID":4444,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@incollection{croce_impact_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:15:33Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Cham}},\n  title = {Impact of {{Spreading Factor Imperfect Orthogonality}} in {{LoRa Communications}}},\n  volume = {766},\n  isbn = {978-3-319-67638-8 978-3-319-67639-5},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-67639-5_13},\n  abstract = {In this paper we study the impact of imperfect-orthogonality in LoRa spreading factors (SFs) in simulation and real-world experiments. First, we analyze LoRa modulation numerically and show that collisions between packets of diﬀerent SFs can indeed cause packet loss if the interference power received is strong enough. Second, we validate such ﬁndings using commercial devices, conﬁrming our numerical results. Third, we modiﬁed and extended LoRaSim, an open-source LoRa simulator, to measure the impact of inter-SF collisions and fading (which was not taken into account previously in the simulator). Our results show that non-orthogonality of the SFs can deteriorate signiﬁcantly the performance especially of higher SFs (10 to 12) and that fading has virtually no impact when multiple gateways are available in space diversity.},\n  booktitle = {Digital {{Communication}}. {{Towards}} a {{Smart}} and {{Secure Future Internet}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-18},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {165-179},\n  keywords = {SF},\n  author = {Croce, Daniele and Gucciardo, Michele and Tinnirello, Ilenia and Garlisi, Domenico and Mangione, Stefano},\n  editor = {Piva, Alessandro and Tinnirello, Ilenia and Morosi, Simone},\n  file = {Croce et al. - 2017 - Impact of Spreading Factor Imperfect Orthogonality.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/AMP8L7Z5/Croce et al. - 2017 - Impact of Spreading Factor Imperfect Orthogonality.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Measurement},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497644,"version":0},"$loki":1217},{"itemID":4445,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@misc{_1semtech_,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-23T15:18:09Z},\n  title = {1-{{SEMTECH}}},\n  file = {SEMTECH.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/E5FUSDPG/SEMTECH.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Specification},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497648,"version":0},"$loki":1218},{"itemID":4446,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@misc{_1alliance_2015,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-23T15:17:54Z},\n  title = {1-{{ALLIANCE}}},\n  date = {2015},\n  file = {2015 - ALLIANCE.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/99EFHYWK/2015 - ALLIANCE.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Specification},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497652,"version":0},"$loki":1219},{"itemID":4456,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@video{pham_extreme_,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-31T14:29:54Z},\n  title = {Extreme Low-Cost \\& Low-Power {{LoRa IoT DIY}} Tutorial},\n  url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsKbJeeav_M},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  director = {{Pham}},\n  groups = {Device},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497658,"version":0},"$loki":1220},{"itemID":4457,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@online{_lowpower_,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-19T17:39:45Z},\n  title = {Low-Power, {{Long}}-Range {{WAN}} for {{IoT}}: A Technology Overview},\n  url = {http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/Paper/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  file = {Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/3BE7JT5S/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Cloud},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497664,"version":0},"$loki":1221},{"itemID":4460,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@misc{_riot_,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-31T14:49:52Z},\n  title = {{{RIOT}}},\n  file = {osis201620160305journee-iotriotbaccelli-160510124208.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/TLMJNEN6/osis201620160305journee-iotriotbaccelli-160510124208.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Riot os},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497668,"version":0},"$loki":1222},{"itemID":4463,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{baccelli_riot_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-20T16:04:46Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{RIOT}}: {{An Open Source Operating System}} for {{Low}}-{{End Embedded Devices}} in the {{IoT}}},\n  volume = {5},\n  issn = {2327-4662, 2372-2541},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8315125/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JIOT.2018.2815038},\n  shorttitle = {{{RIOT}}},\n  abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges, compact operating systems are required on low-end devices to ease development and portability of IoT applications.

The data was collected during the cooperative platooning tests that took place in Helmond in the frame of the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge 2016. In the competition, between 8-10 autonomous vehicles formed two platoons in different lanes and were required to merge into a predeﬁned competition zone. The performance is characterized using CAM CCDFs which serves as a base for the evaluation of a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control application. Two important effects has been identiﬁed that affect to the reliability of the communications. Firstly, there is a degradation with the distance that appears to be stronger for cars and more gentle for trucks. This indicates that occlusions heavily affect the connectivity of ITS-G5A. Secondly, the reliability is below expectations and some of the vehicles perform consistently worse than others. Although further investigation is required, a possible explanation for this is that a highly congested channel is making some of the vehicles get stuck and are not able to regularly access the channel.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-23},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {1899-1903},\n  author = {Parra, Ignacio and Garcia-Morcillo, Alvaro and Izquierdo, Ruben and Alonso, Javier and Fernandez-Llorca, D. and Sotelo, M.A.},\n  file = {Parra et al. -

In contrast to conventional secure routing protocols in which a central authority (CA) is required to facilitate the identification and authentication of each device, the BCR protocol operates in a distributed manner with no CA. The BCR protocol utilizes smart contracts to discover a route to a destination or data gateway within heterogeneous IoT networks. Any intermediary device can guarantee a route from a source IoT device to a destination device or gateway. We compare the performance of BCR with that of the\n              Ad-hoc\n              On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in a network of\n              \n                \n                  14\n                \n              \n              devices.

The IoT gateways play an important role in the IoT applications to bridge between sensor networks and the external environment through the Internet. Typically, the IoT gateways collect and send the data collected from sensors and actuators to external platforms where they will be remotely analyzed. However, the users desire a more adapted IoT gateway that can improve the IoT data privacy preservation before sending them to these external platforms. Thus, an IoT gateway that enables a better control over the set of private IoT resources and protects the collected personal data and their privacy is required. For this purpose, we propose a Semantic IoT Gateway that helps implement a dynamic and ﬂexible privacy-preserving solution for the IoT domain. First, it enables to match between the data consumer’s terms of service and the data owner’s privacy preferences by generating an adapted privacy policy. Second, it converts the privacy policy into a custom smart contract. Finally, it connects a set of private IoT resources to a distributed network using the blockchain technology to host the generated smart contracts. A smart contract is an executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. Our proposal, which is highlighted through an example and experimentation on a real-world use-case, has given the expected results.},\n  booktitle = {On the {{Move}} to {{Meaningful Internet Systems}}. {{OTM}} 2018 {{Conferences}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {207-225},\n  author = {Loukil, Faiza and Ghedira-Guegan, Chirine and Boukadi, Khouloud and Benharkat, Aïcha Nabila},\n  editor = {Panetto, Hervé and Debruyne, Christophe and Proper, Henderik A. and Ardagna, Claudio Agostino and Roman, Dumitru and Meersman, Robert},\n  file = {Loukil et al. - 2018 - Semantic IoT Gateway Towards Automated Generation.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/W3ZCMLKK/Loukil et al. - 2018 - Semantic IoT Gateway Towards Automated Generation.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Application},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497992,"version":0},"$loki":1243},{"itemID":4564,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@book{cesa-bianchi_prediction_2006,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T17:39:11Z},\n  langid = {french},\n  location = {{Cambridge ; New York}},\n  title = {Prediction, learning, and games},\n  isbn = {978-0-521-84108-5},\n  pagetotal = {394},\n  publisher = {{Cambridge University Press}},\n  date = {2006},\n  keywords = {ML,Game},\n  author = {Cesa-Bianchi, Nicolò and Lugosi, Gábor},\n  file = {Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi - 2006 - Prediction, learning, and games.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/8JU7HZE7/Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi - 2006 - Prediction, learning, and games.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {x},\n  note = {02716}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628497996,"version":0},"$loki":1244},{"itemID":4581,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{pau_sms_2015,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-31T14:06:49Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{SMS}}: {{Smart Mobile Systems}} @ {{UPMC}} 1},\n  date = {2015},\n  pages = {14},\n  author = {Pau, Giovanni},\n  file = {Pau - 2015 - SMS Smart Mobile Systems @ UPMC.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/P3KQIC84/Pau - 2015 - SMS Smart Mobile Systems @ UPMC.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {IEEE},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498006,"version":0},"$loki":1245},{"itemID":4582,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{briante_supporting_2014,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-31T14:06:25Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Supporting Augmented Floating Car Data through Smartphone-Based Crowd-Sensing},\n  volume = {1},\n  issn = {22142096},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214209614000412},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.vehcom.2014.08.002},\n  abstract = {Over the last few years, academia, governmental agencies, automotive and electronic industries have increased their interest in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and services.

When employing visual sensors in that scenario, still images and video streams may be retrieved from monitored areas, potentially providing valuable data for many applications. Actually, visual sensor networks may need to be highly dynamic, reﬂecting the changing of parameters in smart cities. In this context, characteristics of visual sensors and conditions of the monitored environment, as well as the status of other concurrent monitoring systems, may affect how visual sensors collect, encode and transmit information. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based approach to dynamically conﬁgure the way visual sensors will operate concerning sensing, coding and transmission patterns, exploiting different types of reference parameters. This innovative approach can be considered as the basis for multi-systems smart city applications based on visual monitoring, potentially bringing signiﬁcant results for this research ﬁeld.},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {Sensors},\n  urldate = {2019-05-30},\n  date = {2017-01-05},\n  pages = {93},\n  author = {Costa, Daniel and Collotta, Mario and Pau, Giovanni and Duran-Faundez, Cristian},\n  file = {Costa et al. - 2017 - A Fuzzy-Based Approach for Sensing, Coding and Tra.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/6CMGTUUD/Costa et al. - 2017 - A Fuzzy-Based Approach for Sensing, Coding and Tra.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {IEEE},\n  note = {00017}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498070,"version":0},"$loki":1250},{"itemID":4587,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{hadaller_vehicular_2007,\n  timestamp = {2019-05-30T08:15:50Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{San Juan, Puerto Rico}},\n  title = {Vehicular Opportunistic Communication under the Microscope},\n  isbn = {978-1-59593-614-1},\n  url = {http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1247660.1247685},\n  doi = {10.1145/1247660.1247685},\n  abstract = {We consider the problem of providing vehicular Internet access using roadside 802.11 access points. We build on previous work in this area [18, 8, 5, 11] with an extensive experimental analysis of protocol operation at a level of detail not previously explored. We report on data gathered with four capture devices from nearly 50 experimental runs conducted with vehicles on a rural highway. Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\\% of overall throughput, 15\\% of the time. (2) We quantify the eﬀects of ten problems caused by the mechanics of existing protocols that are responsible for this throughput loss; and (3) We recommend best practices for using vehicular opportunistic connections. Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be signiﬁcantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP. The central message in this paper is that wireless conditions in the vicinity of a roadside access point are predictable, and by exploiting this information, vehicular opportunistic access can be greatly improved.},\n  eventtitle = {The 5th International Conference},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on {{Mobile}} Systems, Applications and Services  - {{MobiSys}}

{In this paper, a novel adaptive TDMA-based clustering for critical event detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is proposed. The aim of our adaptive approach is to detect the critical event, such a fire detection in the forest, at the required delay with minimum energy consumption. So, when an event occurs, only the sensor nodes in the detection area will be in active mode, while the others will be in sleep mode. The reaction to the event is made locally. This behavior can consume less energy. The simulation results show that our adaptive approach is better than the non-adaptive approach. We have compared our results to other works and we have proved the efficiency of our approach in terms of energy consumption.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{Fourth International Conference}} on {{Communications}} and {{Networking}} ({{ComNet}})},\n  booktitle = {Fourth {{International Conference}} on {{Communications}} and {{Networking}}, {{ComNet}}-2014},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2014-03},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  author = {Gherairi, Salsabil and Ouni, Sofiane and Kamoun, Farouk},\n  file = {Gherairi et al. - 2014 - Adaptive TDMA-based clustering for critical event .pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/TCNUSY9M/Gherairi et al. - 2014 - Adaptive TDMA-based clustering for critical event .pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Wakeup},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498358,"version":0},"$loki":1300},{"itemID":4765,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{wannachai_adaptive_2015,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:03:06Z},\n  location = {{Singapore}},\n  title = {Adaptive {{Transmission Range Based}} on {{Event Detection}} for {{WSNs}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8055-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7106944/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ISSNIP.2015.7106944},\n  eventtitle = {2015 {{IEEE Tenth International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Sensors}}, {{Sensor Networks}} and {{Information Processing}} ({{ISSNIP}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE Tenth International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Sensors}}, {{Sensor Networks}} and {{Information Processing}} ({{ISSNIP}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2015-04},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  keywords = {Range},\n  author = {Wannachai, Autanan and Champrasert, Paskorn},\n  file = {Wannachai_Champrasert_2015_Adaptive Transmission Range Based on Event Detection for WSNs.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/59QLME7G/Wannachai_Champrasert_2015_Adaptive Transmission Range Based on Event Detection for WSNs.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Mesh/WSN},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498370,"version":0},"$loki":1301},{"itemID":4775,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{garg_low_2019,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T17:38:06Z},\n  langid = {american},\n  title = {Low {{Packet Loss}} and {{High PDR}} Based {{Self Adaptive Sleep Wake Scheduling Technique}} for {{WSN}}},\n  issn = {2350-1146},\n  url = {http://www.asianssr.org/index.php/ajct/article/view/739},\n  journaltitle = {Asian Journal For Convergence In Technology (AJCT)},\n  shortjournal = {1},\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2019-04-11},\n  keywords = {Delay,PDR},\n  author = {Garg, Aarushee and Saxena, Kshitiz},\n  file = {Garg_Saxena_2019_Low Packet Loss and High PDR based Self Adaptive Sleep Wake Scheduling.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/9DQ86FLN/Garg_Saxena_2019_Low Packet Loss and High PDR based Self Adaptive Sleep Wake Scheduling.pdf:application/pdf;Snapshot:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/FEEFM5LJ/739.html:text/html},\n  groups = {Wakeup},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498384,"version":0},"$loki":1302},{"itemID":4778,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{preeth_adaptive_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-03T13:02:26Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An Adaptive Fuzzy Rule Based Energy Efficient Clustering and Immune-Inspired Routing Protocol for {{WSN}}-Assisted {{IoT}} System},\n  issn = {1868-5137, 1868-5145},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12652-018-1154-z},\n  doi = {10.1007/s12652-018-1154-z},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing},\n  shortjournal = {J Ambient Intell Human Comput},\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2018-12-17},\n  keywords = {Tx},\n  author = {Preeth, S.

Relying on a battery not only limits the sensor's lifetime but also makes efficient design and management of WSNs a real challenge. The energy supply limitation provoked many research on WSN allthe protocol layers. This project focus on efficient sleep/wake-up scheduling, aiming to minimize idle listening time thereby reducing the energy consumption, which is one of the fundamental research problems in WSNs. The nodes are kept in rest mode keeping in mind the end goal to spare the vitality of every node to the extent that this would be possible without comprising on packet delivery effectiveness and consequently lifetime was increased. The proposed strategy proposes a vitality productive directing convention with self versatile sleep/wakeup planning that precisely predicts the path and sends the packet through cluster based predicted path in P-LEACH the cluster arrangement technique of LEACH in the chain based architecture of PEGASIs is utilized.

However, the increased connectivity of everyday objects can open manifold security vectors for cybercriminals to perform malicious attacks. These threats are even augmented by the resource constraints and heterogeneity of low-cost IoT devices, which make current host-based and static perimeter-oriented defense mechanisms unsuitable for dynamic IoT environments. Accounting for all these considerations, we reckon that the novel softwarization capabilities of Telco network can fully leverage its privileged position to provide the desired levels of security. To this aim, the emerging software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) paradigms can introduce new security enablers able to increase the level of IoT systems protection. In this paper, we design a novel policy-based framework aiming to exploit SDN/NFV-based security features, by efficiently coupling with existing IoT security approaches. A proof of concept test bed has been developed to assess the feasibility of the proposed architecture. The presented performance evaluation illustrates the benefits of adopting SDN security mechanisms in integrated IoT environments and provides interesting insights in the policy enforcement process to drive future research.},\n  number = {5},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Network Management},\n  urldate = {2019-06-17},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {e2038},\n  author = {Zarca, Alejandro Molina and Bernabe, Jorge Bernal and Farris, Ivan and Khettab, Yacine and Taleb, Tarik and Skarmeta, Antonio},\n  file = {Zarca et al_2018_Enhancing IoT security through network softwarization and virtual security.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/BJJA6A5Y/Zarca et al_2018_Enhancing IoT security through network softwarization and virtual security.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Untitled},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498636,"version":0},"$loki":1324},{"itemID":4849,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{sama_servicebased_2016,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-30T07:56:41Z},\n  location = {{Washington, DC, USA}},\n  title = {Service-{{Based Slice Selection Function}} for {{5G}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-1328-9},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7842265/},\n  doi = {10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842265},\n  eventtitle = {{{GLOBECOM}} 2016 - 2016 {{IEEE Global Communications Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{IEEE Global Communications Conference}} ({{GLOBECOM}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-19},\n  date = {2016-12},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Sama, Malla Reddy and Beker, Sergio and Kiess, Wolfgang and Thakolsri, Srisakul},\n  file = {Sama et al_2016_Service-Based Slice Selection Function for 5G.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/NJ25WB7B/Sama et al_2016_Service-Based Slice Selection Function for 5G.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Slice},\n  note = {00016}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498652,"version":0},"$loki":1325},{"itemID":4852,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{vlahogianni_optimized_2005,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-20T12:08:39Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Optimized and Meta-Optimized Neural Networks for Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction: {{A}} Genetic Approach},\n  volume = {13},\n  issn = {0968090X},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968090X05000276},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.trc.2005.04.007},\n  shorttitle = {Optimized and Meta-Optimized Neural Networks for Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies},\n  shortjournal = {Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies},\n  urldate = {2019-06-20},\n  date = {2005-06},\n  pages = {211-234},\n  author = {Vlahogianni, Eleni I. and Karlaftis, Matthew G. and Golias, John C.},\n  file = {Vlahogianni et al_2005_Optimized and meta-optimized neural networks for short-term traffic flow.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/7T5RZ6JN/Vlahogianni et al_2005_Optimized and meta-optimized neural networks for short-term traffic flow.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {GA},\n  note = {00506}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498664,"version":0},"$loki":1326},{"itemID":4856,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{zorbas_improving_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-20T13:41:30Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{St. Malo}},\n  title = {Improving {{LoRa Network Capacity Using Multiple Spreading Factor Configurations}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-2321-3},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8464901/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICT.2018.8464901},\n  abstract = {LoRa networks enable long range communications for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The current LoRa technology provides a wide range of communication settings whereas many combination settings are orthogonal and, thus, they can be successfully decoded at the gateway when the signals are transmitted simultaneously. Previous simulation results showed that the LoRa network capacity can be improved when multiple communication parameters are applied. In this paper, we model a LoRa network consisting of nodes with different communication settings in terms of bandwidth and spreading factor. We compute the average success probability per conﬁguration as a function of density taking into account both intra and inter-spreading factor collisions. We, also, formulate and solve an optimization problem to maximize the node capacity for a given deployment area and frequency by optimizing the number of nodes having different spreading factor conﬁgurations. We present numerical results and we show that solutions close to the optimal can increase the maximum number of nodes by more than 700\\% compared to case where equal number of users per spreading factor are considered.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-20},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {516-520},\n  author = {Zorbas, Dimitrios and Papadopoulos, Georgios Z. and Maille, Patrick and Montavont, Nicolas and Douligeris, Christos},\n  file = {Zorbas et al. - 2018 - Improving LoRa Network Capacity Using Multiple Spr.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/URAPMILT/Zorbas et al. - 2018 - Improving LoRa Network Capacity Using Multiple Spr.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498682,"version":0},"$loki":1327},{"itemID":4858,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{xunhu_joint_2015,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:33:53Z},\n  location = {{Shanghai, China}},\n  title = {A Joint Utility Optimization Based Virtual {{AP}} and Network Slice Selection Scheme for {{SDWNs}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8795-5},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7497982/},\n  doi = {10.1109/CHINACOM.2015.7497982},\n  eventtitle = {2015 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Communications}} and {{Networking}} in {{China}} ({{ChinaCom}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Communications}} and {{Networking}} in {{China}} ({{ChinaCom}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-20},\n  date = {2015-08},\n  pages = {448-453},\n  keywords = {*},\n  author = {{Xun Hu} and {Rong Chai} and {Guixiang Jiang} and {Haipeng Li}},\n  file = {Xun Hu et al_2015_A joint utility optimization based virtual AP and network slice selection.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/BUKIVYPV/Xun Hu et al_2015_A joint utility optimization based virtual AP and network slice selection.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Slice},\n  note = {00004}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498692,"version":0},"$loki":1328},{"itemID":4862,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{gora_approximating_,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-21T08:45:45Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Approximating {{Trafﬁc Simulation}} Using {{Neural Networks}} and Its {{Application}} in {{Trafﬁc Optimization}}},\n  abstract = {We present an idea for approximating outcomes of trafﬁc simulation using neural networks, which might be especially useful in one of most difﬁcult trafﬁc optimization problems, the trafﬁc signal settings problem.

These devices are usually battery operated and have a radio transceiver that is typically their most power-hungry block. Wake-up radio schemes can be used to achieve a reasonable balance among energy consumption, range, data receiving capabilities and response time. In this paper, a high-sensitivity low power wake-up radio receiver (WUR) for wireless sensor networks is presented. The wake-up radio is comprised of a fully passive differential RF-toDC converter that rectifies the incident RF signal, a low-power comparator and an ultra low power microcontroller to detects the envelope of the on-off keying (OOK) wake-up data used as address. We designed and implemented a novel low power tunable wake up radio with addressing capability, a minimal power consumption of only 196nW and a maximum sensitivity of -55dBm and minimal wake up time of 130μs without addressing and around 1,6ms with 2byte addressing at 10Kbit/s data rate. The flexibility of the solution makes the wake up radio suitable for both power constrained low range application (such as Body Area Network) or applications with long range needs. The wake up radio can work also at different frequencies and the addressing capability directly on board helps reduce false positives. Experimental on field results demonstrate the low power of the solution, the high sensitivity and the functionality.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{IEEE}} 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{IEEE}} 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2014-10},\n  pages = {92-99},\n  author = {Magno, Michele and Benini, Luca},\n  file = {Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/4N2XTWE6/Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf:application/pdf;Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/I2ZFEJCV/Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Wakeup}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498734,"version":0},"$loki":1331},{"itemID":4928,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{spenza_duty_2015,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-19T14:09:41Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Kowloon, Hong Kong}},\n  title = {Beyond Duty Cycling: {{Wake}}-up Radio with Selective Awakenings for Long-Lived Wireless Sensing Systems},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8381-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7218419/},\n  doi = {10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218419},\n  shorttitle = {Beyond Duty Cycling},\n  abstract = {Emerging wake-up radio technologies have the potential to bring the performance of sensing systems and of the Internet of Things to the levels of low latency and very low energy consumption required to enable critical new applications.

Our WRx features very low power consumption ($<$ 1.3µW), high sensitivity (up to −55dBm), fast reactivity (wake-up time of 130µs), and selective addressing, a key enabler of new high performance protocols. We then present ALBAWUR, a cross-layer solution for data gathering in sensing systems that redesigns a previous leading protocol, ALBA-R, extending it to exploit the features of our WRx. We evaluate the performance of ALBA-WUR via simulations, showing that the use of the WRx produces remarkable energy savings (up to ﬁve orders of magnitude), and achieves lifetimes that are decades longer than those obtained by ALBA-R in sensing systems with duty cycling, while keeping latencies at bay.},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE INFOCOM}} 2015 - {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications}}},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications}} ({{INFOCOM}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2015-04},\n  pages = {522-530},\n  author = {Spenza, Dora and Magno, Michele and Basagni, Stefano and Benini, Luca and Paoli, Mario and Petrioli, Chiara},\n  file = {Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/6CM74A8X/Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf:application/pdf;Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/JLXYXZMT/Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Wakeup}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498756,"version":0},"$loki":1332},{"itemID":4929,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{trongnhanle_asynchronous_2015,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-19T14:09:41Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Gallipoli}},\n  title = {Asynchronous on Demand {{MAC}} Protocol Using Wake-up Radio in Wireless Body Area Network},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8981-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7184942/},\n  doi = {10.1109/IWASI.2015.7184942},\n  abstract = {A fast growing class of sensing technology is wearable, where network nodes are tightly coupled with the human body. Wireless body area networks (WBAN) technology has gained popularity over the last few years, with a wide range of applications covered, in particular in health and rehabilitation. Wearable and pervasive computing are able to sense, monitor and process the data to provide smart assistance and context-aware ambient intelligence environments. However present-day WBAN devices are mainly battery-powered and due to energy issue they need to be recharged every day or even hours and thus they miss the expectations for a truly unobtrusive user experience. This work presents a novel energy-efſcient asynchronous MAC protocol using a nano-watt wake up radio with addressing capabilities to reduce the energy consumption of the communication and then extend the WBAN life time. We present the beneſts of the wake up radio in a star topology widely used in WBAN where the number of the node is around 5 to 10. The implemented protocol exploiting the low power consumption of the wake up radio, the low latency and the addressing capabilities can increase signiſcantly the energy efſciency of the single node and entire network reducing both idle listening and data collisions. Result based on measured power consumption and OMNET++ simulation demonstrate that by using the wake up radio it is possible to reduce the power consumption up to 150 times compared to related protocols and the lifetime can be signiſcantly increased in a real world scenario.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 6th {{IEEE International Workshop}} on {{Advances}} in {{Sensors}} and {{Interfaces}} ({{IWASI}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 6th {{International Workshop}} on {{Advances}} in {{Sensors}} and {{Interfaces}} ({{IWASI}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2015-06},\n  pages = {228-233},\n  author = {{Trong Nhan Le} and Pegatoquet, Alain and Magno, Michele},\n  file = {Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/6FXWF28M/Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf:application/pdf;Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/DZBKNYE4/Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Wakeup}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498782,"version":0},"$loki":1333},{"itemID":4930,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{schadhauser_design_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-19T14:09:40Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Design of {{Autonomous Base Stations}} for {{Low Power Wide Area}} ({{LPWA}}) {{Communication}}},\n  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), Machine-to-MachineCommunication (M2M) and Industry 4.0 are keywords arousing great research interest in recent years. All these terms incorporate the idea of data exchange among diverse objects in wireless sensor networks. In a previous paper, we extended the domain of sensorbased applications to the scope of wildlife tracking, in particular the tracking of bats. The concept of a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) sensor network was introduced, built up by lightweight Ultra Low Power (ULP) nodes attached to the back of the animals, transmitting sensor data via long range telemetry over a distance of several kilometers. The network architecture was discussed and suitable transmission schemes meeting the harsh energy and weight restrictions were evaluated. For an optimal system performance, however, it is also essential that the receiving network is properly designed. In this paper, we elaborate the development of a LPWA reception network of telemetry-related base stations, tackling the highly demanding requirements for mobility, energy efﬁciency and remote maintainability. Both, hardware as well as software components are addressed and their interactions are illustrated. The energetically self-sustaining base stations are equipped with directional and omni-directional antennas in a MIMO-like fashion. A Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR) controlled frontend allows for a ﬂexible reception and fast data processing. The operation performance toward the stated requirements is evaluated. Finally, initial results of ﬁeld trials in Berlin (Germany) are presented, prooﬁng the successful recording of actual bat signals.},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Schadhauser, Michael and Robert, Joerg and Heuberger, Albert},\n  file = {Schadhauser et al. - 2017 - Design of Autonomous Base Stations for Low Power W.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/PFGYQRYL/Schadhauser et al. - 2017 - Design of Autonomous Base Stations for Low Power W.pdf:application/pdf;Schadhauser et al. - 2017 - Design of Autonomous Base Stations for Low Power W.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/VB2QFR3F/Schadhauser et al. - 2017 - Design of Autonomous Base Stations for Low Power W.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {houda}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498796,"version":0},"$loki":1334},{"itemID":4931,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{blanckenstein_energy_2012,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-19T14:09:39Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Energy {{Efﬁcient Clustering}} Using a {{Wake}}-up {{Receiver}}},\n  abstract = {We present a new energy-saving method for creating node clusters with similar sensor readings.

Duty cycling, however, does not eliminate idle listening, comes at the price of longer latencies and obtains lifetimes that are still insufﬁcient for many critical applications. Using a wake-up receiver (WUR) allows actual communications on the main radio only for transmission or reception, virtually eliminating node idling. However, the range of current WUR prototypes is still signiﬁcantly shorter than that of the main radio, which can challenge the use of existing WSN protocols in WUR-based networks. In this paper we present an approach to mitigate this limitation of wake-up-based networks. In particular, we show that the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP), a standard protocol for data gathering in WSNs, suitably redeﬁned to work on WUR-endowed nodes, achieves lifetimes of several decades. This constitutes a remarkable improvement over duty cycle-based solutions, where CTP makes the network lasts only a handful of months. At the same time, our WUR-based approach obtains data latencies comparable to those obtained by keeping the main radio always on.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2016-02},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Basagni, Stefano and Petrioli, Chiara and Spenza, Dora},\n  file = {Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/GP7HG8CE/Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf:application/pdf;Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/XM6RSEUR/Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Wakeup}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628498830,"version":0},"$loki":1337},{"itemID":4934,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{seyedmazloum_dcwmac_2011,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-19T14:09:36Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{San Francisco, CA, USA}},\n  title = {{{DCW}}-{{MAC}}: {{An Energy Efficient Medium Access Scheme Using Duty}}-{{Cycled Low}}-{{Power Wake}}-{{Up Receivers}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4244-8327-3 978-1-4244-8328-0 978-1-4244-8325-9 978-1-4244-8326-6},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6093231/},\n  doi = {10.1109/VETECF.2011.6093231},\n  shorttitle = {{{DCW}}-{{MAC}}},\n  abstract = {In this work we present a new low-power medium access scheme for sensor-type networks speciﬁcally with low trafﬁc intensity.

PBA-MAC applies an efﬁcient wakeup mechanism to save the energy of a sensor node as much as possible. It reduces communication cost by enabling a sender to predict the intended receiver’s wakeup time, without introducing unnecessary idle listening or overhearing cost. In addition, it introduces an exponential advance mechanism to handle the prediction error caused by clock drift and hardware platform latency. More importantly, its backcast-based retransmission characteristic can efﬁciently resolve severe wireless collisions caused by concurrent trafﬁc ﬂows. The PBA-MAC is implemented in Contiki operating system. We compare PBA-MAC to some existing energy-efﬁcient MAC protocols.

Therefore, consumed energy due to communications is the critical issue to increase the system performance. In this paper, a nanowatt wake-up radio receiver (WUR) is used cooperatively with the main transceiver in order to reduce the wasted energy of idle listening in asynchronous MAC protocols where the node is waiting for potential messages, while still maintaining the same reactivity. Simulation results show that the throughput can be improve up to 82\\% with 53\\% energy saving compared to non-WUR approach of the TICER protocol.

Standard MAC protocols developed for duty-cycled WSNs such as BMAC, which is the default MAC protocol for TinyOS, employ an extended preamble and preamble sampling. While this “low power listening” approach is simple, asynchronous, and energy-efﬁcient, the long preamble introduces excess latency at each hop, is suboptimal in terms of energy consumption, and suffers from excess energy consumption at nontarget receivers. X-MAC proposes solutions to each of these problems by employing a shortened preamble approach that retains the advantages of low power listening, namely low power communication, simplicity and a decoupling of transmitter and receiver sleep schedules. We demonstrate through implementation and evaluation in a wireless sensor testbed that X-MAC’s shortened preamble approach signiﬁcantly reduces energy usage at both the transmitter and receiver, reduces per-hop latency, and offers additional advantages such as ﬂexible adaptation to both bursty and periodic sensor data sources.},\n  pages = {14},\n  author = {Buettner, Michael and Yee, Gary V and Anderson, Eric and Han, Richard},\n  file = {Buettner et al. - X-MAC A Short PreambSleenMsAoCr NPertowtoocrkosl .pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/8AZQMW8U/Buettner et al. - X-MAC A Short PreambSleenMsAoCr NPertowtoocrkosl .pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {houda}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499032,"version":0},"$loki":1355},{"itemID":4957,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{sutton_zippy_2015,\n  timestamp = {2019-06-28T16:47:22Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Seoul, South Korea}},\n  title = {Zippy: {{On}}-{{Demand Network Flooding}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-3631-4},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2809695.2809705},\n  doi = {10.1145/2809695.2809705},\n  shorttitle = {Zippy},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the challenge of rapidly disseminating rare events through a multi-hop network, while achieving unprecedented energy-eﬃciency.

For example, the LoRa radio protocol enables connecting remote sensors at a distance as long as ten kilometers in a line-of-sight. However, the large area covered also brings several difﬁculties, such as the placement of sensing devices in regards to topology in geography, or the variability of communication latency. Sensing the environment also carries constraints related to the interest of sensing points in relation to a physical phenomenon. Thus, criteria for designs are evolving a lot from the existing methods, especially in complex terrains. This article describes simulation techniques based on geography analysis to compute long-range radio coverages and radio characteristics in these situations. As radio propagation is just a particular case of physical phenomena, it is shown how a uniﬁed approach also allows for characterizing the behavior of potential physical risks. The case of heavy rainfall and ﬂooding is investigated. Geography analysis is achieved using segmentation tools to produce cellular systems which are in turn translated into code for high-performance computations. The paper provides results from practical complex terrain experiments using LoRa, which conﬁrm the accuracy of the simulation, and scheduling characteristics for sample networks.

LPWAN devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multi-hop network. However, to ensure efﬁcient and reliable communication LPWAN devices often provide a large number of transmission parameters. For example, a LoRa device can be conﬁgured to use different spreading factors, bandwidth settings, coding rates and transmission powers, resulting in over 6720 possible settings. It is a challenge to determine the setting that minimises transmission energy cost while meeting the required communication performance. This paper is the ﬁrst to present a thorough analysis of the impact of LoRa transmission parameter selection on communication performance. We study in detail the impact of parameter settings on energy consumption and communication reliability. Using this study we develop a link probing regime which enables us to quickly determine transmission settings that satisfy performance requirements.

These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identiﬁed the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider ﬁxed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard.

However, the limited bandwidth available for physical layer modulation in LoRa makes it unsuitable for high bit rate data transfer from devices like image sensors. In this paper, we propose a new method for mangrove forest monitoring in Malaysia, wherein we transfer image sensor data over the LoRa physical layer (PHY) in a node-to-node network model. In implementing this method, we produce a novel scheme for overcoming the bandwidth limitation of LoRa. With this scheme the images, which requires high data rate to transfer, collected by the sensor are encrypted as hexadecimal data and then split into packets for transfer via the LoRa physical layer (PHY). To assess the quality of images transferred using this scheme, we measured the packet loss rate, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) index of each image. These measurements verify the proposed scheme for image transmission, and support the industrial and academic trend which promotes LoRa as the future solution for IoT infrastructure.},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = {Sensors},\n  shortjournal = {Sensors},\n  urldate = {2019-07-02},\n  date = {2018-09-27},\n  pages = {3257},\n  author = {Jebril, Akram and Sali, Aduwati and Ismail, Alyani and Rasid, Mohd},\n  file = {Jebril et al_2018_Overcoming Limitations of LoRa Physical Layer in Image Transmission.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/GTVNDLS8/Jebril et al_2018_Overcoming Limitations of LoRa Physical Layer in Image Transmission.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499106,"version":0},"$loki":1361},{"itemID":4972,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{lavric_performance_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-02T09:48:56Z},\n  title = {Performance Evaluation of {{LoRaWAN}} Communication Scalability in Large-Scale Wireless Sensor Networks},\n  volume = {2018},\n  journaltitle = {Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing},\n  date = {2018},\n  author = {Lavric, Alexandru and Popa, Valentin},\n  file = {Lavric_Popa_2018_Performance evaluation of LoRaWAN communication scalability in large-scale.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/Z5IDWBH6/Lavric_Popa_2018_Performance evaluation of LoRaWAN communication scalability in large-scale.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499110,"version":0},"$loki":1362},{"itemID":4973,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{hoeller_analysis_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-02T15:40:25Z},\n  title = {Analysis and Performance Optimization of {{LoRa}} Networks with Time and Antenna Diversity},\n  volume = {6},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {32820--32829},\n  author = {Hoeller, Arliones and Souza, Richard Demo and López, Onel L.

This study draws upon relevant research to gain an understanding of underlying principles and issues involved in the design and management of long-range and low-power networks such as LoRa. This research uses empirical evidence that has been gathered through experiments with a LoRa network to analyse network design and identify challenges and then proposes cost-effective and timely solutions. Particularly, practical measurements of LoRa network dependencies and performance metrics are used to support our proposals. This research identifies a number of network performance metrics that need to be considered and controlled when designing and managing LoRaspecific networks from the perspectives of hardware, software, networking and security.},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {16},\n  author = {Chen, Jiaming James and Chen, Jiexuan Edward and Liu, Vicky and Fairbairn, Laurence and Simpson, Leonie},\n  file = {Chen et al. - 2018 - A Viable LoRa Framework for Smart Cities.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/E7M8DQJP/Chen et al. - 2018 - A Viable LoRa Framework for Smart Cities.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499366,"version":0},"$loki":1386},{"itemID":5097,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{dawaliby_adaptive_2019,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-02T10:11:53Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Adaptive Dynamic Network Slicing in {{LoRa}} Networks},\n  volume = {98},\n  issn = {0167739X},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X18318429},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.future.2019.01.042},\n  abstract = {Knowing the heterogeneity of applications and services that need to to be supported in the internet of things (IoT), network slicing came out as a potential solution that virtually isolates 5G networks with various service requirements over a common physical network infrastructure. The latter needs to simultaneously support and isolate traﬃc issued from mobile and machine services which may require diﬀerent needs in terms of reliability, latency, and bandwidth. In this paper, network slicing is investigated in LoRa networks over ﬁxed and dynamic slicing strategies. The performance of LoRa slices is evaluated with diﬀerent spreading factor (SF) conﬁgurations. Then, a dynamic inter-slicing algorithm is proposed based on a maximum likelihood estimation that avoids resource starvation and prioritizes a slice over another depending on its QoS requirements. Moreover, a novel intra-slicing strategy is proposed that maximizes resource allocation eﬃciency of LoRa slices with regard to their delay requirements. An energy module for LoRa in NS3 is also implemented to evaluate the energy consumption of devices in each slice. Simulation results performed in realistic LoRa scenarios highlight the utility of our proposition in improving QoS requirements of IoT devices and providing isolation between slices.},\n  journaltitle = {Future Generation Computer Systems},\n  urldate = {2019-07-02},\n  date = {2019-09},\n  pages = {697-707},\n  author = {Dawaliby, Samir and Bradai, Abbas and Pousset, Yannis},\n  file = {Dawaliby et al. - 2019 - Adaptive dynamic network slicing in LoRa networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/HUDFIQ6T/Dawaliby et al. - 2019 - Adaptive dynamic network slicing in LoRa networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499384,"version":0},"$loki":1387},{"itemID":5100,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{gaddam_comparative_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-02T15:32:33Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Ernakulam}},\n  title = {A {{Comparative Study}} on {{Various LPWAN}} and {{Cellular Communication Technologies}} for {{IoT Based Smart Applications}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-5744-7},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8529060/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICETIETR.2018.8529060},\n  abstract = {The usage of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in device designing is increasing rapidly.

The message delivery between participated nodes and gateway in the WSNs affects the quality of service (QoS) such as energy consumption and the successful delivery rate (SDR). In this paper, we present a novel packet transmission model for a smart wireless paging sensor network (WPSN) based on LoRaWAN, which supports a real-time elderly care application. The model is used to investigate the performance of star topology communication on elderly care via Markov discrete-time M/M/1 queuing system. The proposed traffic model enables the performance evaluation of WPSN for elderly care.

Mostly, the IoT concept involves massive end devices distributed over a wide topographical area, hence establishing a high density and large-scale environment. LoRaWAN makes use of six orthogonal spreading factors (SFs) in order to improve spectral efficiency and increase the capacity. In this paper, we focus on the LoRaWAN class A network end devices and the problem of network scalability under high-density urban environment by using both the confirmed and unconfirmed mode of communication. Simulation results show that the urban environment has a high impact on the distribution of SFs, thus leading to low network performance in terms of success ratio.

In this work, we present an enhanced LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN MAC protocol is characterized by the restrictive use of the channel, limited by the regulatory authorities to a 1\\% duty cycle per cycle (i.e., 36 s per hour) per node. This regulation penalizes the nodes which require a channel access time greater than the limited duty cycle to occasionally transmit a large amount of data such as video surveillance or access control information in applications like smart school surveillance. However, some other nodes like environment sensors sharing a same LoRaWAN server may send very small amounts of information (e.g. temperature, humidity, ...) and under-use the authorized activity time of 1\\% duty cycle. Hence the idea of implementing an activity time sharing mechanism among nodes that allows devices to borrow additional activity time from a device or set of devices that have completed the transmission of their packets and do not need the remaining time of the corresponding duty cycle. Our work extends and improves the activity time sharing mechanism initially proposed in [1]. Instead of FIFO sharing-time allocation based on a global activity time, which may lead to the starvation of the nodes that are others than that in the head of FIFO line, we propose a new time allocation algorithm based on the classiﬁcation of the diﬀerent requests according to their needs in terms of their QoS requirements. It allows to satisfy a larger number of nodes requiring extra time, with less control overheads while ensuring fairness. Our time-sharing algorithm has been implemented and tested on the wasp-mote chip of libelium, showing the performance improvement and its practical usability.},\n  booktitle = {Ad-Hoc, {{Mobile}}, and {{Wireless Networks}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {147-162},\n  author = {Benkahla, Norhane and Tounsi, Hajer and Song, Ye-Qiong and Frikha, Mounir},\n  editor = {Montavont, Nicolas and Papadopoulos, Georgios Z.},\n  file = {Benkahla et al. - 2018 - Enhanced Dynamic Duty Cycle in LoRaWAN Network.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/YN2LAJUR/Benkahla et al. - 2018 - Enhanced Dynamic Duty Cycle in LoRaWAN Network.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-00247-3_15},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499536,"version":0},"$loki":1402},{"itemID":5960,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{hevner_design_,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-17T15:14:19Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Design {{Science}} in {{Information Systems Research}}},\n  pages = {32},\n  author = {Hevner, Alan R and March, Salvatore T and Park, Jinsoo and Ram, Sudha},\n  file = {Hevner et al. - Design Science in Information Systems Research.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/45FDG7HF/Hevner et al. - Design Science in Information Systems Research.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {x},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499542,"version":0},"$loki":1403},{"itemID":6056,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{amiri_sharding_,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-23T09:19:28Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {On {{Sharding Permissioned Blockchains}}},\n  abstract = {Permissioned Blockchain systems rely mainly on Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols to establish consensus on the order of transactions.

To utilize such extra resources, in this paper we introduce a model that leverages transaction parallelism by partitioning the nodes into clusters (partitions) and processing independent transactions on different partitions simultaneously. The model also shards the blockchain ledger, assigns different shards of the blockchain ledger to different clusters, and includes both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions.

Recently, the concept of off-chain payments is introduced that led to the idea of establishing a payment network called Lightning Network (LN). Off-chain links provide the ability to do transactions without writing to Blockchain. However, LN’s design still favors fees and is creating hub nodes that defeat the purpose of Blockchain. In addition, it is still not reliable as not all the transactions are guaranteed to be transmitted to their destinations. If current retailers would like to use it, these problems might hinder its adoption. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate creating a private payment network among a given set of retailers that will serve their business needs, just like the idea of private Blockchains. The goal is to build a pure peer-to-peer topology that will eliminate the need for relays and increase the robustness of payments. Using off-chain links as edges and retailers as nodes, the problem is formulated as a multi-ﬂow commodity problem where transactions represent the commodities from various sources to destinations. As the multi-ﬂow commodity problem is NP-Complete, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm in a dynamic way by updating the edge weights when new payment paths are to be found. The order of transactions is randomized to provide fairness among the retailers. The evaluations indicate that the proposed heuristic comes close to an optimal solution while providing scalability and user privacy.},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Erdin, Enes and University, Florida International and Cebe, Mumin and University, Florida International and Akkaya, Kemal and University, Florida International and Bulut, Eyuphan and University, Virginia Commonwealth and Uluagac, A Selcuk and University, Florida International},\n  file = {Erdin et al. - A Heuristic-Based Private Bitcoin Payment Network .pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/2P2BQWCI/Erdin et al. - A Heuristic-Based Private Bitcoin Payment Network .pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Blockchain},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499572,"version":0},"$loki":1406},{"itemID":6065,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{zola_cascading_,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-23T09:20:19Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Cascading {{Machine Learning}} to {{Attack Bitcoin Anonymity}}},\n  abstract = {Bitcoin is a decentralized, pseudonymous cryptocurrency that is one of the most used digital assets to date.

Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a singlekeyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efﬁciency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom ﬁlter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efﬁciency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom ﬁlter will be used to ﬁlter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost signiﬁcantly.

On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efﬁcient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly.

DaiMoN rewards these contributing peers with cryptographic tokens. A main feature of DaiMoN is that it allows peers to verify the accuracy improvement of submitted models without knowing the test labels. This is an essential component in order to mitigate intentional model overﬁtting by model-improving peers. To enable this model accuracy evaluation with hidden test labels, DaiMoN uses a novel learnable Distance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function proposed in this paper.

It therefore allows proof-of-improvement (PoI) by peers without providing them access to true test labels. We provide analysis and empirical evidence that under DEL, peers can accurately assess model accuracy.

According to an IBS report, the cost of developing a System on Chip (SoC) at 14nm may be as high as \\$300 million [1]. The economics of semiconductor IC development favors high volume production, while high volume cannot be attained without developing an IC that serves a large number of applications. Some of these applications are in lowmargin Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where an SoC cannot command a high price. Consequently, without the ability to customize IC features after production, the price of an IC will be determined by its lowest priced application. This motivates the manufacturers to develop capabilities for post-production IC customization. The commodity microprocessor business offers an example of post-production customization, where a manufacturer can tailor cache size, number of cores and frequency of operation for a target market segment after a chip has been manufactured. Today, such customization is limited to one-time programming (OTP) for predetermined IC bins. In this paper, we explore how an IC can be programmed repeatedly and securely using a blockchain-based smart contract. This will enable users to upgrade IC features, or rent upgraded IC features for a ﬁxed period after it has been purchased. The availability of such a system could, for example, allow a buyer to upgrade her processor from i3 to i5 after it has been purchased to scale to her computing needs in exchange of a payment made to the manufacturer. IC feature conﬁguration is implemented by ﬁrmware updates from the manufacturer. The smart contract takes the feature conﬁguration request from the IC as input and outputs the source of corresponding ﬁrmware. To support remote and authorized update by manufacturer, we propose an on-die hardware module that communicates with the smart contract and enforces its functionalities. Availability of this module also facilitates secure ﬁrmware update. The blockchain makes the update protocol secure and prevents users from obtaining unauthorized update.

However, the learning process of the existing federated learning platforms rely on the direct communication between the model owner, e.g., central cloud or edge server, and the mobile devices for transferring the model update. Such a direct communication may be energy inefﬁcient or even unavailable in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider adopting the relay network to construct a cooperative communication platform for supporting model update transfer and trading. In the system, the mobile devices generate model updates based on their training data. The model updates are then forwarded to the model owner through the cooperative relay network. The model owner enjoys the learning service provided by the mobile devices. In return, the mobile devices charge the model owner certain prices. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission among the mobile devices that use the same relay node, the rational mobile devices have to choose their relay nodes as well as deciding on their transmission powers. Thus, we formulate a Stackelberg game model to investigate the interaction among the mobile devices and that between the mobile devices and the model owner. The Stackelberg equilibrium is investigated by capitalizing on the exterior point method. Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Feng, Shaohan and University, Nanyang Technological and Niyato, Dusit and University, Nanyang Technological and Wang, Ping and University, York and Kim, Dong In and University, Sungkyunkwan and Liang, Ying-Chang},\n  file = {Feng et al. - Joint Service Pricing and Cooperative Relay Commun.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/9KYSTAAZ/Feng et al. - Joint Service Pricing and Cooperative Relay Commun.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Mesh/WSN}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499762,"version":0},"$loki":1425},{"itemID":6355,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{chen_efficient_,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-23T09:30:31Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Efficient {{Image Transmission Using LoRa Technology In Agricultural Monitoring IoT Systems}}},\n  abstract = {Reliable image transmission using LoRa in IoT monitoring systems is considered to be challenging due to insufﬁcient LoRa data rate and payload size.

Due to the beneﬁts of energy harvesting (EH) technologies, wireless devices are able to support the dataintensive wireless multimedia services by harvesting energy from the environment. Energy harvesting has emerged as the promising technology to solve the energy supply problem while bringing new challenges due to the stochastic nature of the harvested energy in supporting the heterogeneous statistical quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. However, due to the unknown dynamics of the harvested energy as well as the channel state information (CSI), it is challenging to design the efﬁcient routing protocol for selecting the optimal routing and power allocation policies under the statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints. To overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose the Q-learning based optimal routing and power allocation policies through learning from the history of the energy harvesting process while satisfying the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over multihop big-data relay networks. In particular, under the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS requirements, we formulate the endto-end effective-capacity optimization problem for the batteryfree energy harvesting based big-data multihop relay networks. Then, we apply the Markov decision process and Q-learning methods for deriving the optimal multihop routing algorithms over big-data multihop relay networks. Also conducted is a set of simulations which evaluate the system performances and show that our proposed Q-learning based multihop routing scheme outperforms the other existing schemes under the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over multihop big-data relay networks.},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Zhang, Xi and Wang, Jingqing and Zhu, Qixuan},\n  file = {Zhang et al. - Q-Learning Based Energy Harvesting for Heterogeneo.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/W74AYANG/Zhang et al. - Q-Learning Based Energy Harvesting for Heterogeneo.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Mesh/WSN}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499790,"version":0},"$loki":1428},{"itemID":6369,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{malky_evaluation_,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-23T09:31:46Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Evaluation of {{Precalibrated Electrochemical Gas Sensors}} for {{Air Quality Monitoring Systems}}},\n  abstract = {Harmful atmospheric pollutants have been attributed to causing adverse weather conditions and health problems, which are particularly prevalent in more populated global regions such as in megacities.

Most works focus on designing efﬁcient discovery schedule under a pre-deﬁned low duty cycle such that the neighboring nodes can discover each other in a short time.

Among all, real-time IoT services start to draw increasing attentions. Conventionally, cloud plays the role as the service provider in IoT but is no longer considered as the rational option for the real-time services due to service transmission latency and communication overhead. Therefore, we propose a novel rate-adaptive fog service delivery platform, namely RA-FSD, aiming at real-time service provisioning and network utility maximization (NUM) of the underlying IoT resources based on the newly emerged fog computing paradigm. The platform leverages fog nodes as either fog service provider to oﬀer timely services for end users, or service intermediaries to help track network conditions and mitigate communication overhead. By doing so, service consumers would always beneﬁt from the fact that services produced by IoT applications are in their proximity and thus delivered to destination in a prompt manner. A service rate-adaptive algorithm is also developed as the key component of the RA-FSD platform to handle the abrupt changes happened in IoT network, dynamically adjust service delivery rate based on the network condition while retaining satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) to each service consumer, and support both elastic and inelastic network services from heterogeneous IoT applications.},\n  booktitle = {Service-{{Oriented Computing}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-07-28},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {246-254},\n  author = {Zhang, Tiehua and Jin, Jiong and Yang, Yun},\n  editor = {Pahl, Claus and Vukovic, Maja and Yin, Jianwei and Yu, Qi},\n  file = {Zhang et al. - 2018 - RA-FSD A Rate-Adaptive Fog Service Delivery Platf.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/BGR9BCHS/Zhang et al. - 2018 - RA-FSD A Rate-Adaptive Fog Service Delivery Platf.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Applications},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-03596-9_16},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499914,"version":0},"$loki":1441},{"itemID":6537,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{duhart_organic_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-29T06:10:28Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Toward Organic Ambient Intelligences?: {{EMMA}}},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {215},\n  author = {Duhart, Clément},\n  file = {Duhart - Toward organic ambient intelligences EMMA.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/K99MF4B4/Duhart - Toward organic ambient intelligences EMMA.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Choregraphie},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499918,"version":0},"$loki":1442},{"itemID":6539,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{aparicio-navarro_addressing_2019,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-29T12:28:30Z},\n  location = {{Paris, France}},\n  title = {Addressing {{Multi}}-{{Stage Attacks Using Expert Knowledge}} and {{Contextual Information}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-8336-1},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8685841/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICIN.2019.8685841},\n  eventtitle = {2019 22nd {{Conference}} on {{Innovation}} in {{Clouds}}, {{Internet}} and {{Networks}} and {{Workshops}} ({{ICIN}})},\n  booktitle = {2019 22nd {{Conference}} on {{Innovation}} in {{Clouds}}, {{Internet}} and {{Networks}} and {{Workshops}} ({{ICIN}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-07-29},\n  date = {2019-02},\n  pages = {188-194},\n  author = {Aparicio-Navarro, Francisco J. and Chadza, Timothy A. and Kyriakopoulos, Konstantinos G. and Ghafir, Ibrahim and Lambotharan, Sangarapillai and AsSadhan, Basil},\n  file = {Aparicio-Navarro et al_2019_Addressing Multi-Stage Attacks Using Expert Knowledge and Contextual Information.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/6AEDTP77/Aparicio-Navarro et al_2019_Addressing Multi-Stage Attacks Using Expert Knowledge and Contextual Information.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Social},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499932,"version":0},"$loki":1443},{"itemID":6542,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{behrad_network_2019,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-29T12:30:55Z},\n  title = {Network {{Access Control}} for the {{IoT}}: {{A Comparison Between Cellular}}, {{Wi}}-{{Fi}} and {{LoRaWAN}}},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICIN.2019.8685884},\n  shorttitle = {Network {{Access Control}} for the {{IoT}}},\n  abstract = {The IoT (Internet of Things) is expected to encounter new business trends like wholesale wireless connectivity, due to the emergence of new user demands.

In this paper, we propose a new analytical framework, based on stochastic geometry theory, to model realistic RANs that leverage the business opportunities offered by network slicing. We mathematically prove the benefits of slicing radio access networks as compared to non-sliced infrastructures. Based on this, we design a new admission control functional block, STORNS, which takes decisions considering per slice SLA guaranteed average experienced throughput. A radio resource allocation strategy is introduced to optimally allocate transmit power and bandwidth (i.e., a slice of radio access resources) to the users of each infrastructure tenant. Numerical results are illustrated to validate our proposed solution in terms of potential spectral efficiency, and compare it against a non-slicing benchmark.},\n  urldate = {2019-07-30},\n  date = {2019-01-16},\n  keywords = {Computer Science - Information Theory,**},\n  author = {Sciancalepore, Vincenzo and Di Renzo, Marco and Costa-Perez, Xavier},\n  file = {Sciancalepore et al_2019_STORNS.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/FID3ETMU/Sciancalepore et al_2019_STORNS.pdf:application/pdf;arXiv.org Snapshot:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/JWPJHW44/1901.html:text/html},\n  groups = {Slice},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499978,"version":0},"$loki":1446},{"itemID":6557,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{ksentini_enforcing_2017b,\n  timestamp = {2019-07-30T07:50:00Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Toward {{Enforcing Network Slicing}} on {{RAN}}: {{Flexibility}} and {{Resources Abstraction}}},\n  volume = {55},\n  issn = {0163-6804},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7946928/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MCOM.2017.1601119},\n  shorttitle = {Toward {{Enforcing Network Slicing}} on {{RAN}}},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Magazine},\n  urldate = {2019-07-30},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {102-108},\n  author = {Ksentini, Adlen and Nikaein, Navid},\n  file = {Ksentini and Nikaein - 2017 - Toward Enforcing Network Slicing on RAN Flexibili.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/5U8DMYIU/Ksentini and Nikaein - 2017 - Toward Enforcing Network Slicing on RAN Flexibili.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Slice},\n  note = {00063}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628499986,"version":0},"$loki":1447},{"itemID":6559,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{ferrus_5g_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-08T08:37:04Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {On {{5G Radio Access Network Slicing}}: {{Radio Interface Protocol Features}} and {{Configuration}}},\n  volume = {56},\n  issn = {0163-6804},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8253541/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700268},\n  shorttitle = {On {{5G Radio Access Network Slicing}}},\n  abstract = {Network slicing is a fundamental capability for future Fifth Generation (5G) networks to facilitate the cost-effective deployment and operation of multiple logical networks over a common physical network infrastructure in a way that each logical network (i.e. network slice) can be customized and dimensioned to best serve the needs of specific applications (e.g. mobile broadband, smart city, connected car, public safety, fixed wireless access) and users (e.g. general public, enterprise customers, virtual operators, content providers).

These networks could be either a pointto-point (P2P) communication link or a point-to-multipoint (P2M) communication link, which, P2M is also known as multicasting that addresses multiple subscribers. The P2M systems usually have diverse nodes (also called as ‘Things’) according to services and levels of security required. These nodes need an uninterrupted network inter-connectivity as well as a cloud platform to manage data sharing and storage.

Albeit the technology itself is quite mature and speciﬁed, how to effectively allocate wireless resources so as to support a large amount of devices in a same terrestrial area is an open challenge. This paper contributes by proposing two algorithms (of incremental complexity) which are shown to outperform the basic Adaptive Rate Strategy (ADR) so far considered. A ﬁrst approach, named EXPLoRa-SF, shows the beneﬁts of a simple strategy which does not limit to use (as per ADR) distance/RSSI measurements, but also selects Spreading Factors (SF) based on the total number of connected devices. The advantages attained with EXPLoRa-SF further lead us to propose a more sophisticated algorithm, named EXPLoRa-AT, which employs an innovative “ordered waterﬁlling” approach which attempts to allocate the spreading factors so as to equalize the Time on Air of the packets transmitted by the system’s end devices in each spreading factor’s group. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms signiﬁcantly outperform the basic ADR strategy, and particularly the EXPLoRa-AT algorithm appears very robust to different operating conditions and consistently guarantees high bit rates in the case of high trafﬁc loads.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-08-07},\n  date = {2017-10},\n  pages = {1-8},\n  author = {Cuomo, Francesca and Campo, Manuel and Caponi, Alberto and Bianchi, Giuseppe and Rossini, Giampaolo and Pisani, Patrizio},\n  file = {Cuomo et al. - 2017 - EXPLoRa Extending the performance of LoRa by suit.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/CTKEI9B4/Cuomo et al. - 2017 - EXPLoRa Extending the performance of LoRa by suit.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628500106,"version":0},"$loki":1461},{"itemID":6616,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{reynders_lorawan_2018,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-07T19:52:13Z},\n  title = {A {{LoRaWAN}} Module for Ns-3: Implementation and Evaluation},\n  doi = {10.1145/3199902.3199913},\n  shorttitle = {A {{LoRaWAN}} Module for Ns-3},\n  abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) communication has been proposed to connect massive numbers of devices in large areas.

Indeed, deploying LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios must achieve two main goals: efficient communications among a large number of devices and resilience against dynamic channel conditions due to demanding environmental settings (e.g., the presence of many buildings). This work investigates adaptive mechanisms to configure the communication parameters of LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios. To this end, we develop FLoRa, an open-source framework for end-to-end LoRa simulations in OMNeT++. We then implement and evaluate the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism built into LoRa to dynamically manage link parameters for scalable and efficient network operations. Extensive simulations show that ADR is effective in increasing the network delivery ratio under stable channel conditions, while keeping the energy consumption low. Our results also show that the performance of ADR is severely affected by a highly-varying wireless channel. We thereby propose an improved version of the original ADR mechanism to cope with variable channel conditions. Our proposed solution significantly increases both the reliability and the energy efficiency of communications over a noisy channel, almost irrespective of the network size. Finally, we show that the delivery ratio of very dense networks can be further improved by using a network-aware approach, wherein the link parameters are configured based on the global knowledge of the network.},\n  journaltitle = {NOMS 2018 - 2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  keywords = {Scalability,Simulation,End-to-end principle,Internet of things,Noisy-channel coding theorem,Open-source software,Propagation constant},\n  author = {Slabicki, Mariusz and Premsankar, Gopika and Francesco, Mario Di},\n  file = {Slabicki et al_2018_Adaptive configuration of lora networks for dense IoT deployments.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/5D3E5HH3/Slabicki et al_2018_Adaptive configuration of lora networks for dense IoT deployments.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00025}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628500130,"version":0},"$loki":1463},{"itemID":6619,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{reynders_power_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-07T19:32:22Z},\n  title = {Power and Spreading Factor Control in Low Power Wide Area Networks},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICC.2017.7996380},\n  abstract = {Low power wide area networks are gaining interest to connect thousands of nodes to the internet of things.

This paper presents a scheme to efficiently optimize the packet error rate fairness inside a LoRaWAN cell.

Furthermore, we provide a performance comparison of these access schemes, in terms of both successful transmissions and energy efficiency, in a typical Internet of Things deployment. Results show that Listen Before Talk is effective in reducing inter-node interference even for long-range transmissions, although the energy efficiency can be lower than that provided by ALOHA methods. Furthermore, the adoption of rate adaptation schemes lowers the energy consumption while improving the fairness among nodes at different distances from the receiver.

Among LPWANs, Long Range (LoRa) WAN has been the most promising; an upcoming IoT protocol, already adopted by big mobile operators like KPN and TTN. With LoRaWANs, IoT-devices transmit data to their corresponding gateways over many kilometers in a single hop and with 1\\% duty-cycle. However, in a LoRa network, any device claims the channel for data-transmission without performing channel-sensing or synchronization with other devices. This increases humongously the number of collisions of information-packets when the number of IoT-devices that are connected per gateway increases. \nTo improve the utilization of the channel, we propose the application of persistent-Carrier Sense Multiple Access (p-CSMA) protocols on the MAC layer of LoRaWANs.

In particular, the classes adding p-CSMA functionality to the IoT-devices are presented. Additionally, the dependencies and relations between these classes and an existing LoRaWAN module on which they apply are detailed.

The proposed models allow for the optimization of resource allocation within a cell given a set of QoS requirements and a traffic model.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Wireless Communications Letters},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {566-569},\n  keywords = {Throughput,Simulation,Duty cycle,Telecommunications link,Requirement,Numerical analysis,Canonical account,Coherence (physics),Implicit Shape Model,Mathematical optimization,Noise shaping,Quality of service,Time complexity,Traffic shaping},\n  author = {Sørensen, René Brandborg and Kim, Dong Min and Nielsen, Jimmy Jessen and Popovski, Petar},\n  file = {Sørensen et al_2017_Analysis of Latency and MAC-Layer Performance for Class A LoRaWAN.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/VHQXM7DM/Sørensen et al_2017_Analysis of Latency and MAC-Layer Performance for Class A LoRaWAN.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628500228,"version":0},"$loki":1471},{"itemID":6668,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@article{pop_does_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-07T19:51:47Z},\n  title = {Does {{Bidirectional Traffic Do More Harm Than Good}} in {{LoRaWAN Based LPWA Networks}}?},\n  doi = {10.1109/glocom.2017.8254509},\n  abstract = {The need for low power, long range and low cost connectivity to meet the requirements of IoT applications has led to the emergence of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networking technologies. The promise of these technologies to wirelessly connect massive numbers of geographically dispersed devices at a low cost continues to attract a great deal of attention in the academic and commercial communities. Several rollouts are already underway even though the performance of these technologies is yet to be fully understood. In light of these developments, tools to carry out 'what-if analyses' and predeployment studies are needed to understand the implications of choices that are made at design time. While there are several promising technologies in the LPWA space, this paper specifically focuses on the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology. In particular, we present LoRaWANSim, a simulator which extends the LoRaSim tool to add support for the LoRaWAN MAC protocol, which employs bidirectional communication. This is a salient feature not available in any other LoRa simulator. Subsequently, we provide vital insights into the performance of LoRaWAN based networks through extensive simulations. In particular, we show that the achievable network capacity reported in earlier studies is quite optimistic. The introduction of downlink traffic can have a significant impact on the uplink throughput. The number of transmit attempts recommended in the LoRaWAN specification may not always be the best choice. We also highlight the energy consumption versus reliability trade-offs associated with the choice of number of retransmission attempts.},\n  journaltitle = {GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  keywords = {Throughput,Scalability,Simulation,Duty cycle,Telecommunications link,Requirement,Emergence,Protocol stack,Retransmission (data networks)},\n  author = {Pop, Alexandru-Ioan and Raza, Usman and Kulkarni, Parag and Sooriyabandara, Mahesh},\n  file = {Pop et al_2017_Does Bidirectional Traffic Do More Harm Than Good in LoRaWAN Based LPWA Networks.pdf:/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/lib/iot/storage/HB94CUG8/Pop et al_2017_Does Bidirectional Traffic Do More Harm Than Good in LoRaWAN Based LPWA Networks.pdf:application/pdf},\n  groups = {Configuration selection},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":""},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1567628500240,"version":0},"$loki":1472},{"itemID":6677,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"reference":"@inproceedings{hauser_proposal_2017,\n  timestamp = {2019-08-07T20:17:19Z},\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Proposal of {{Adaptive Data Rate Algorithm}} for {{LoRaWAN}}-{{Based Infrastructure}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-2074-8},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8114467/},\n  doi = {10.1109/FiCloud.2017.47},\n  abstract = {Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are expected to interconnect a high number of simple and inexpensive devices.
