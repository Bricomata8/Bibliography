Affirmed Service Automation Platform (ASAP)

The Challenge
The majority of mobile network operators (MNOs) today address service provisioning and element configuration through a mix of manual processes and “spot” automation tools. This approach is time consuming and error prone, resulting in delayed market entry and frequent customer service issues. Instead of end-to-end service automation and orchestration, MNOs struggle to manage networks featuring products from multiple vendors— and often multiple product versions from the same vendor. This multiplicity doesn’t lend itself to simplicity, requiring network operations teams to individually configure services for each specific device and device version. As a result, MNOs experience significant delays when attempting to roll out new services, deploy new networks or onboard new customers.

ASAP: It’s About Time
Think about the time your network operations team spends defining and provisioning new services, configuring elements, managing updates and testing new services. Now imagine being able to automate those processes to shave weeks from your production cycle. That’s the power of ASAP: a network-wide service automation and orchestration platform that radically simplifies service creation, service provisioning and the turn-up of new virtual network function (VNF) instances in your network.

Mobile Network Operators are struggling to compete with agile web companies. Being able to launch, modify, and kill services in a matter of days, rather than months

solution enables non-programmers to quickly create service templates or

recipes from existing methods of procedure (MOPs) and execute those recipes

across the entire network, providing a complete solution for service lifecycle management.

ASAP goes beyond current service

provisioning tools to provide complete

configuration management across multi-

vendor virtual and physical network elements

and network-wide service instances. It

empowers network operators to create new

service definitions faster with no complex

coding required, and liberates OSS/BSS

support teams from the tiresome task of

provisioning each element or virtual instance

in the network to support those services. By extending the benefits of service automation

carriers to reap the full rewards of network virtualization sooner.

Why ASAP? »» Allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to quickly
create new service definitions without complex coding »» Frees OSS/BSS teams to concentrate on creating policy/business logic rather than implementing it »» Accelerates service deployment in your network »» Eliminates provisioning and configuration errors that result from manual processes »» Delivers northbound/southbound configuration synchronization between the ASAP platform and all deployed network functions »» Provides rapid onboarding of new customer services instances in your network »» Supports end-to-end testing and validation of services before and after production deployment »» Simplifies service deployment in new regions

Features »» GUI-driven service creation screens with drag-and-
drop commands »» Secure sandbox for seamless movement between
testing and production environments »» Monitors, modifies and synchronizes service recipes
across a wide ecosystem of networked devices including both virtual and physical packet gateways, policy servers, switches and session border controllers »» Supports service integration across complex, multivendor networks including both physical and virtual instances of network elements »» Support of multiple interfaces (NETCONF, REST, SOAP, CLI, etc) »» Device and network element agnostic »» Coding-less service creation-operational Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) are empowered to create services (“recipes”) without the need of a programing language or coding requirements »» Agent-less service execution-no need to support a client agent on the Managed Device

New Services Enabled by Automation
One has to look at the Automated Configuration Management Platform (ACMP) as a best practice that accelerates and multiplies service opportunities. The real benefit of automating service provisioning in virtualized and hybrid environments is the opportunity to launch services that were otherwise too daunting or too expensive to launch.
