What do we need?
● Get a complete ecosystem of Wireless Sensors and Actuators to lower the cost of Automation with: ●Long life time (> 10 Y) ●Easy to install ●Worldwide coverage ●Interoperable ●Small/Flat footprint for aesthetic ●Low cost
● With some transmission range needs varying from applications/use cases
● For mass market deployment

But with additional challenges: Embedded more and more intelligence within sensors when suitable?
● Need of more advanced sensors that require computation capability to run complex algorithm to send not anymore only data but rather relevant information
● An example is the “Video as a Sensor” to move from Kbytes of images transfer to send only relevant information:
●To reduce the data to be transferred benefit on transmission time (limiting bandwidth saturation, power consumption, system response time)
●To reduce the data to be stored ● Provide more flexibility in the control architecture with direct potential
communication / control between sensors and actuators

What are the challenges
● Sensors itself: additional/smarter sensing technologies, lower cost, lower power consumption
● Power supply:
● Power management ● Energy harvesting, storage
● RF transmission: from Short range up to Long range ● Low power constraint at the sensor platform level ● Low power MCU with computation capability when required ● Simplify the commissioning

Example 1: Low cost wireless sensors for Ambient

● Short range wireless sensors with 10 Y life time without maintenance

- Allowing to monitor temperature, Rh, CO2, Light, motion….

Window /door contact sensor

- Based on ULP sensor Platform with typical
1 µA average Power consumption

Temperature, Rh sensor

- Long life time battery or solar cell (> 10Y)

Light level/PIR sensor
CO2 sensor

- ZigBee wireless communication (ZGP) with typical indoor transmission range from 20 to 30 m

RTU or other HVAC equipment
Light switch

Example 2: Advanced Occupancy Detection
● Capability to process at the sensor level the data with relative complex algorithm for:
● Real presence detection ● People counting and localization ● Posture recognition ●…
● With power consumption constraint to make it run wirelessly (> 100 µW)
● Requiring optimized power management to provide required low noise voltage to polarize the IR imaging sensor with optimized time sequences
● MCU with resources and relative low power consumption for processing the algorithm + optimization of the code for lowering power consumption

Schneider Electric

Example 3: Asset Monitoring sensor
● A batteryless robust thermal sensor that can run for 20 Y in harsh environment to monitor electrical contact conditions on bus bar/cable/CB connections by detecting overheating:
● Energized by 50Hz magnetic field surrounding busbars and cables ● Busbars temperature measured by means of thermistor component ● ZigBee wireless communication protocol to the Gateway for cloud interface ● Ultra low power electronics
●Reduced leakage current even at high temperature (no DC/DC convertor…) ●Withstand up to 125°C

Example 4: Long and Mid range wireless sensor
● More and more objects will be connected. Some of them are far from the networks and classical 2.4 GHz radios like Bluetooth, ZigBee or WiFi are not able to cover the long range.
● A large part of use cases and applications require a few among of data (a few bytes every hours or days). This allows very low data rate and long range radio communication.
● For long range communications, available current solution are GPRS or 3G: too expensive (RF module + subscription), not compliant with small batteries, made in order to transmit files (a few Kbytes every days).

New technologies are now ready in order to connect object: • Long Range • Very low data rate • Low Power • Low Cost • Small size of data • Operated Networks or Private infrastructures

Conclusion

● Sensors will play a critical role within IoT applications

● Trends is moving sensors to rather low cost, low footprint, long life time wireless sensors for mass deployment in the field

● More and more intelligence will be also distributed at the Sensors/Actuators level either for local control or for optimization of the data transfer (processed data)

● Technologies challenges have to be overcame even if today technologies is enhancing rapidly and is becoming more and more affordable allowing to tackle some of the challenges

● One of the key challenge highlighted by IoT is relative to the wireless communication standards, meaning how to ensure interoperability across applications/devices
