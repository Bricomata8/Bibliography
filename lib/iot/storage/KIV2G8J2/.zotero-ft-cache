Figure 3: Combining Affirmed Innovations 4

MICRO-SERVICES ARCHITECTURE
Affirmed Networks is continuing to innovate an industry-unique VNF architecture with further decomposition, leveraging a separate stateless database that is working in conjunction with container-based applications. The resulting value is a mass customization, micro-services-based approach that is more processor efficient, occupies a smaller footprint, and enables the ability to upgrade and incrementally launch services in a more agile, parallel fashion without impacting neighboring applications. New services creation is now significantly less impactful on operations. This rapid innovation architecture enables the mobile operator with speed- to-market to launch low-risk, low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) services that either enable revenue velocity of new services or fast fail services that carry minimal cost and risk.
Figure 4: Rapid Feature Development with Cloud Native Architecture
Virtual Probe
Affirmed has the industry’s only fully virtualized probe that is integrated with the mobile core and derives robust analytic feeds natively from the VNF. This implementation is much more cost effective than external probes. External probes cut the performance of the mobile core in half due to the duplication of session mirroring. They also require double capacity of the IP infrastructure and require separate hardware compute platforms to run the probe and analytic reporting platforms. Affirmed’s vProbe is dynamic and captures real-time granular analytics of user behavior that can be utilized to invoke and create new policies and monetize new services offerings.

These new services and policies can be introduced and automated through the use of our Affirmed Service Automation Platform (ASAP). Affirmed’s vProbe also captures the analytic data once, which can be streamed via a single instance to the Affirmed mediation service function (MSF) platform which produces customized report views for billing, operations, marketing, and end customers.

SERVICE AUTOMATION & SERVICE CHAINING
Service automation and service chaining are key operational capabilities of virtualization. Service providers can leverage Affirmed’s ASAP and integrated service function chaining (Workflow) solutions to establish a competitive advantage for revenue velocity, customized vertical applications, and agile new service introduction. These capabilities greatly simplify service creation as well as significantly lower the operational cost and timeframe to launch new services.

ASAP provides end-to-end, multi-vendor service automation that spans legacy and virtualized network functions.
Figure 6: Enable Rapid Service Development With Affirmed's Service Automation Platform Workflow is utilized to dynamically create and apply service chains that provide customized service flow treatments per IoT vertical service via a simple GUI. This integrated solution enables an environment for low cost, rapid service innovation.

NETWORK SLICING
Affirmed is the first company to deliver network slicing (vSSF) for 3G, 4G, and 5G networks. Affirmed’s vSSF solution enables the service provider to gracefully micro-segment real-time service flows based upon very granular GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) attributes and offer differentiated services. Affirmed’s network slicing ensures each vertical service flow is directed to specialized virtual compute resources to meet the unique attributes and performance needs of different IoT verticals. This also has the added benefit of best-optimizing infrastructure cost.
Figure 8: Deliver Customized and Differentiated Services with Affirmed's Virtual Slice Selection Function
Network slicing also enables the mobile operator to meet the high diversity of IoT vertical service requirements by directing each slice to a virtualized zone configured to handle the unique latency, throughput, capacity, security, availability, and service treatment of the specific vertical service.
8

This micro-segmentation capability further enables the service provider to create slices for a variety of use cases, such as
1. Slicing off a specific service use case like sending traffic to a third-party hosted application provider;
2. Migrating control plane or user plane traffic off existing infrastructure to gracefully migrate to a 5G infrastructure;
3. Utilizing slicing to perform a software upgrade of a virtualized zone then redirect the slice of traffic back onto the virtualized zone once the software upgrade is completed;
4. Slicing problematic traffic off the production network into a troubleshooting sandbox to isolate users or sessions in a granular fashion.

VALUE-ADDED SERVICES
Affirmed has the industry’s broadest set of mobile VNFs, offering ubiquitous network access across multiple mobile and WiFi environments. These VNFs are combined with robust GiLAN features needed to identify, manage, and monetize internet anchored services. This is especially important for service differentiation, policy management, and partnerships in a post net-neutrality world. Affirmed’s solution anchors the Gn mobile session, as well as the Gi Internet session simultaneously. As such, Affirmed’s mobile core possesses full knowledge and control of the endto-end service flow. Through the use of deep packet inspection(DPI) and application signature heuristics, the mobile core solution opens the mobile flow only once, sharing meta-data with all consolidated VNFs, dynamically applying a pre-configured services chain to treat the identified flow, then re-packetizing the flow and place it in the fast path. This efficient software architecture requires very little processing for opening and closing packets. DPI and heuristics work in conjunction with Workflow, Affirmed’s industry unique, rapid service chaining, and graphical user interface (GUI) platform. Services that previously took months to launch can now be launched in a matter of minutes to quickly and economically monetize new service concepts.

AFFIRMED IoT SERVICES PLATFORM (AISP)
The Affirmed IoT services platform (AISP) is a pre-integrated hosted platform that enables a simplified, low-cost, rapid time-to-revenue opportunity for the service provider to launch new services. The AISP solution is an application platform that integrates with the IoT mobile infrastructure and the mobile operator's back office to provide a single common northbound interface for integration of IoT applications. The AISP allows for uniformity of operations and billing as well as the integration of applications that scale most readily with the breadth of multiple IoT applications. This is achieved without the need for extensive systems integration for each new application introduced to the provider’s services portfolio, enabling the rapid launch of new services in the most economical method possible. As a micro-services-based hosted platform, the AISP supports device management and protocols, analytics and rule engines, security, certificate and profile management, per customer portal access, billing mediation, and management of the data lake.

MOBILE EDGE COMPUTING (MEC)
Affirmed is first in the industry to launch a control and user plane separation (CUPS) based mobile core architecture. With a fully decomposed, independently scalable VNF architecture of management, signaling, application, and user plane functions; execution of the next evolutionary step to geographic CUPS was a natural extension of our existing vEPC solution. Affirmed’s CUPS- based solution is ushering in a new class of high throughput, low latency mobile services by distributing the mobile core infrastructure out to the edge of the network. This enables the highest Quality of Experience (QoE) for subscribers, especially for support of new, latencysensitive services, and high bandwidth applications. Mobile edge computing and CUPS architecture are enablers for new ultra-low latency use cases like critical IoT(C-IoT), virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).
12

A new use case example that requires these network attributes is autonomous cars, where real-time analytics, geo-relevant network data, and significant data throughput are essential to delivering this innovative service. These new network edge capabilities require significant packet processing compute, software efficiency, and application treatment of local content flows to lower backhaul costs in this emerging environment of explosive data growth. Affirmed’s virtualized CUPS-based vEPC software, coupled with Intel Skylake servers, can run up to 150G of throughput per server and instantiate a distributed composite VNF solution that anchors the mobility session, as well as treats content flows at the edge with caching and local breakout services.
Figure 13: Seamlessly Transform to 5G Services with Affirmed CUPS In addition to the edge services paradigm shift, centrally consolidating control plane and signaling functions allows the service provider to manage the geographically-extended mobile core as one, logical mobile platform. Centralized management and pooling of subscriber policy, authentication, management, and billing functions offers considerable operational cost reduction and network simplification. Furthermore, the mobile operator can independently scale user, control, and signaling planes for greatest efficiency and cost control. With CUPS and mobile edge computing (MEC), the mobile operator will have the ability to seamlessly transform to 5G services and accelerate a competitive marketplace position.
