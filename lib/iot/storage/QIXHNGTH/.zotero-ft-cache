Abstract‚ÄîLoRaWAN is a promising low power long range wireless communications technology for the Internet of Things. An important feature of LoRaWAN gateways is related to so-called capture effect: under some conditions the gateway may correctly receive a frame even if it overlaps with other ones. In this paper, we develop a pioneering mathematical model of a LoRaWAN network which allows Ô¨Ånding network capacity and transmission reliability taking into account the capture effect.

I. INTRODUCTION
Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are a promising solution for the Internet of Things, especially those related to sensor and actuator networks. Recently LoRa/LoRaWAN has become a very popular LPWAN technology, mostly thanks to its reliable PHY design which enables energy-efÔ¨Åcient long range communications and resilience to noise. At the same time, LoRaWAN MAC protocol has fallen a victim of oversimpliÔ¨Åcation due to the pursuit of keeping end devices cheap and easy-to-implement and therefore has many open issues [1]. Being an open solution operating in the ISM band, LoRaWAN faces an outlook of multiple independent networks using the same frequency range in vicinity of each other, which will result in problems related to interference. Such a prospect could be avoided by the usage of an efÔ¨Åcient power allocation and channel access scheme, however, its design requires an accurate model of network operation.
Although LoRaWAN speciÔ¨Åcation was released in 2015, LoRa/LoRaWAN has already been extensively studied. Most papers pay attention to LoRa PHY [2]‚Äì[4], leaving MAC out of scope. Some researches have been directed towards performance evaluation of LoRaWAN networks in order to Ô¨Ånd the limits of this technology via simulation [5], [6]. At the same time, little attention has been paid to analytical models. Existing works [7], [8] consider only unacknowledged transmission mode and

Poisson total network trafÔ¨Åc and apply the well-known approach for ALOHA modeling [9]. However, as shown in [10], such an approach provides incorrect results for basic LoRaWAN operation with acknowledgements (ACKs) and retransmissions, therefore more advanced mathematical model is required to describe the network.
In this paper, we extend the approach introduced in [10] for LoRaWAN network modelling by taking into account the propagation losses and capture effect: i.e. the possibility of a packet to be received even if it intersects in time with packets from other devices but its power is sufÔ¨Åciently high. The proposed model can be used to optimize, design and evaluate the performance of LoRaWAN MAC layer solutions, related to channel access, power and spreading factor control [8].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we explain LoRaWAN channel access and its features important for modelling. Section III contains the description of the modelled scenario. In Section IV we describe the mathematical model of LoRaWAN channel access with capture effect. Section V provides numerical results which prove the accuracy of the model. Conclusion is given in Section VI.
II. LORAWAN CHANNEL ACCESS DESCRIPTION
A typical LoRaWAN [11] network consists of a server, gateways (GWs) and end devices, called motes. GWs are connected to the server via IP network and to the motes via LoRa links and act as relays between them.
We consider class A devices, which operate in a way fruitful for sporadic uplink data transmission.
A LoRaWAN network simultaneously operates in several wireless channels. For example, in Europe LoRaWAN devices can use three main channels and one downlink channel. To transmit a data frame, each mote randomly selects one of the main channels (see Fig. 1). Having received the frame, the GW transmits two ACKs. The Ô¨Årst ACK is sent Ì†µÌ±á1 after the frame reception in the same channel where data was transmitted. The second one is sent after timeout Ì†µÌ±á2 = Ì†µÌ±á1 + 1 s in the downlink channel. If the mote does not receive any ACK, it makes a retransmission. The standard recommends making a

retransmission in a random time drawn from interval [1, 1 + Ì†µÌ±ä ] seconds, where Ì†µÌ±ä = 2.
At the PHY layer, LoRaWAN uses Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation. Its main feature is that signals with different spreading factors can be distinguished and received simultaneously, even if they are transmitted in the same time on the same channel. Channel width, coding rate and the spreading factor determine the data rate. Lower data rates allow reliable transmission for big distance. Data frames are sent at a rate determined by the GW, but the algorithm for rate allocation is not speciÔ¨Åed in the standard. The Ô¨Årst ACK is sent at a rate lower than the data rate for the frame transmission by a conÔ¨Ågurable offset (it can be zero). The second ACK should always be sent at a Ô¨Åxed data rate, by default the lowest one.
III. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider a LoRaWAN network that consists of a GW and Ì†µÌ±Å motes and operates in Ì†µÌ∞π main channels and one downlink channel. The motes use data rates 0, 1, ..., Ì†µÌ±Ö, set by the GW. The motes generate frames according to a Poisson process with total intensity Ì†µÌºÜ (the network load). All motes transmit frames with 51-byte Frame Payload, which is the biggest payload that can Ô¨Åt a frame at the lowest data rate. The frames are transmitted in the acknowledged mode, and ACKs carry no frame payload. We consider a situation, when motes have no queue, i.e. if two messages are generated, a mote transmits only the most recent one. Motes have a retry limit Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ∞ø and drop frames after Ì†µÌ±ÖÌ†µÌ∞ø retransmission attempts.
We consider a scenario, when a frame is successful if for its duration its power is greater than the noise plus the power of the interfering frames transmitted in the same channel and at the same rate by at least Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±Ö dB, where Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±Ö is the co-channel rejection parameter, speciÔ¨Åed in LoRa chip datasheets. For the described scenario, we want to Ô¨Ånd the maximal load at which the network can provide reliable communications. We deÔ¨Åne packet error rate as the probability of frame transmission attempt to be unsuccessful and state the problem to Ô¨Ånd the packet error rate (PER) as a function of network load Ì†µÌºÜ.
IV. MATHEMATICAL MODEL
To solve the problem, we develop a mathematical model of the transmission process. We consider separately the Ô¨Årst and the subsequent transmission attempts. As the Ô¨Årst transmission attempts are described by the Poisson process, to Ô¨Ånd the PER in these assumptions, in Section IV-A, we consider the approach used to evaluate ALOHA networks [9] and extend it to take into account ACKs. This approach is however inapplicable for retransmissions, because they do not form a Poisson process, so in Section IV-B we propose a way to take account of them. For both kinds of attempts, we consider the possibility of several frames to be transmitted simultaneously and one of them to be successfully received if

it has sufÔ¨Åcient power. Sections IV-A and IV-B describe the general model of transmission process, while in Section IV-C we study a speciÔ¨Åc case, when the motes are distributed uniformly in a circle around the GW and the path-loss is described by Okumura-Hata model.

A. The First Transmission Attempt

Let Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ñ be the probability of a mote using data rate Ì†µÌ±ñ. Its Ô¨Årst transmission attempt is successful with probability:

Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì±Ü,1 = Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò,

(1)

where Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é is the probability that the data frame is transmitted without collision at data rate Ì†µÌ±ñ and Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò is the probability that at least one ACK is received by the

mote, provided that the data frame is successful.

Since packets transmitted in different channels and

at different rates do not collide, we need to consider

separately each combination of channel and data rate.

.

Probability of a successful data frame transmission

consists of several summands. Firstly, a data frame is

successful if it does not intersect with another frame or an ACK of a previous frame. Let Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é and Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò be the durations of data frame and ACK, respectively, at rate Ì†µÌ±ñ.

Intersection with a frame does not occur if no frames are
generated in the interval [‚àíÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é, Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é], relative to the
beginning of the considered frame. For a Poisson process the probability of such event is Ì†µÌ±í . ‚àí2Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é We consider

that the GW cancels ACK transmission if it is receiving

a data frame, so a collision with an ACK happens only if the ACK is generated in the interval [‚àíÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò, 0]. The rate of ACK generation is Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñ, so the probability to avoid collision with an ACK is Ì†µÌ±í . ‚àíÌ†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò

Secondly, data frame is also successful, if it inter-

sects with another frames, but the interfering signal is

weaker. The probability of Ì†µÌ±ò motes transmitting their

frames in time intervals that intersect the frame equals Ì†µÌ±í‚àí2Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é (Ô∏Ä2Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é)Ô∏ÄÌ†µÌ±ò /Ì†µÌ±ò!. If we sum over all possible Ì†µÌ±ò values, we obtain the equation for Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é:

The probability that at least one ACK arrives is calculated according to the inclusion-exclusion principle: Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò = Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò1 + Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò2 ‚àí Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò1Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò2, where Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò1 and Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò2 are the probabilities that the Ô¨Årst and the second ACK, respectively, is transmitted successfully, provided that data was transmitted at rate Ì†µÌ±ñ.
The Ô¨Årst ACK is delivered if no data frame intersects it or if the interfering signal is weaker:

where in the Ô¨Årst summand we take the minimum of Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é and Ì†µÌ±á1, because if a frame exceeds Ì†µÌ±á1, it breaks the acknowledged frame, but such an event is already taken into account by Ì†µÌ±ÉÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é. The second summand stands for the situation, when Ì†µÌ±ò motes start transmission

after the beginning of the ACK (if data is transmitted

before ACK, the GW skips ACK transmission), but their

total power is less than the power of the GW‚Äôs signal, which happens with probability WÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ,Ì±ÄÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±í. In this case, the signal power is measured at the ACK recipient mote,

therefore the distributions of signal power in eqs. (2)

and (3) are different.

The second ACK is transmitted without collision if no

data frame is successful in any other channel or at any

other data rate, such that its second ACK would begin

before the considered one and intersect it:

where in the exponent we multiply the interval during

which the ACK should not start by the total intensity of

successful frame process from all channels and all data

rates except the one used by the considered mote.

B. Retransmissions
The mote makes a retransmission when it does not receive any ACK after transmission For that it randomly selects a channel and transmits data frame again after a random delay from 1 to 1 + Ì†µÌ±ä seconds.
We consider a situation, when retransmission is caused by collision of two motes‚Äô (motes A and B) frames and Ô¨Ånd the probability of successful retransmission. We use this probability as an amendment to the model to take account of the retransmissions. Although it does not describe a case when more than two motes make a retransmission, it allows us to estimate Ì†µÌ±É Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±Ö correctly, as shown in Section V. There are two different cases.

The Ô¨Årst case is when one frame is much more

powerful than another (Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ∞¥ > Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ∞µ + Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±Ö or Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ∞µ > Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ∞¥ + Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±Ö), so it is successful and the second one is

needs a retransmission. Let the probability of such event be WÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñÌ±úÌ†µÌ±õÌ†µÌ±í. In this case, retransmission is successful with the same probability as the Ô¨Årst transmission attempt.

The second case is when both frames are unsuccessful, which happens with probability WÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñÌ∞µÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±°‚Ñé. In this case, both motes make a retransmission which is likely to

result in a new collision, because frames in LoRaWAN

are rather long compared with the window for random delay (compare Ì†µÌ±ä = 2 s and Ì†µÌ±á0Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é ‚âà 2.4 s). Let 0 be the time when the frame of mote A begins, and Ì†µÌ±•

be the offset for the frame of mote B (see Fig. 2). If

motes choose different channels for retransmission, the

collision

is

resolved.

Otherwise,

with

probability

1 Ì†µÌ∞π

,

they

choose the same channel. In this case, let Ì†µÌ±¶ and Ì†µÌ±ß be the

times when motes A and B start their retransmission,

respectively. The value of Ì†µÌ±¶ is distributed uniformly in

the interval [Ì†µÌºè, Ì†µÌºè + Ì†µÌ±ä ], where Ì†µÌºè is the frame duration Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é plus the timeout for the ACK. The value of Ì†µÌ±ß is distributed uniformly in the interval [Ì†µÌºè + Ì†µÌ±•, Ì†µÌºè + Ì†µÌ±• + Ì†µÌ±ä ].

The retransmission results in a new collision, if one

frame intersects with another or if a frame starts after the

GW starts transmitting the acknowledgement for another frame. Let Ì†µÌ±ì (Ô∏ÄÌ†µÌ±¶, Ì†µÌ±ß, Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞∑Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±é, Ì†µÌ±áÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì∞¥Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò)Ô∏Ä be the indicator of such an event, i.e., it equals 1 if it happens and 0 otherwise:

Here we Ô¨Årstly integrate over all possible offsets between

mote A and mote B frames that result in a collision,

and then integrate over all possible random delays for

both motes. The integral in the denominator stands for

the collision probability, so in the end we obtain the

conditional probability of a new collision, provided that

the Ô¨Årst collision has already happened.

resulting probability of successful delivery of data frame

C. SpeciÔ¨Åc Case

The general model contains values W**, to deÔ¨Åne which we consider a speciÔ¨Åc distribution of motes in

space, a speciÔ¨Åc channel model and a way to assign data

rates to the motes. Let us consider the Okumura-Hata

path-loss channel with no fading [12]. The signal power

at the receiver equals Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±• (Ì†µÌ±ë) = Ì†µÌ∞¥ ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞µ lg (Ì†µÌ±ë), where lg(Ì†µÌ±•) is base 10 logarithm of Ì†µÌ±•, Ì†µÌ∞¥ = Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±• ‚àí 69.55 ‚àí 26.16 lg (Ì†µÌ±ì )+13.82 lg (‚ÑéÌ†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ä )+3.2 (lg (11.75‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±ÄÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±í))2 ‚àí 4.97 and Ì†µÌ∞µ = 44.9 ‚àí 6.55 lg (‚ÑéÌ†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ä ). Here Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±• is the transmit power (in dBM), ‚ÑéÌ†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ±ä is the height of the GW antenna, ‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±ÄÌ†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±°Ì†µÌ±í is the height of the mote‚Äôs antenna and Ì†µÌ±ë is the distance between them.

Let the motes be spread around the GW uniformly in

a circle with radius Ì†µÌ±Ö. In this case, the pdf of the Mote‚Äôs

distance

from

the

GW

equals

Ì†µÌºå(Ì†µÌ±ü)

=

We

consider

a

case, when the server has a set of sensitivity thresholds

(Ô∏ÄÌ†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì±öÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õ, Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì±öÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±•)Ô∏Ä , Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ†µÌ±ñ+Ì±öÌ†µÌ±ñ1Ì†µÌ±õ = Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì±öÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±•, and assigns data rate Ì†µÌ±ñ

to a mote if the power of its signal at the GW is within

[Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì±öÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õ, Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì±öÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±•) interval. These bounds deÔ¨Åne distance

intervals [Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌºàÌ†µÌ±ñ), within which motes use speciÔ¨Åc data

rates (see Fig. 3a). The radii are found as the solution of the equations Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±• (Ì†µÌºáÌ†µÌ±ñ) = Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì±öÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±õ and Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±• (Ì†µÌºàÌ†µÌ±ñ) = Ì†µÌ±§Ì†µÌ†µÌ±ñ Ì±öÌ†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±•.
Under such considerations we, Ô¨Årstly, derive the

probability of a mote to use data rate Ì†µÌ±ñ as Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ñ = (Ô∏ÄÌ†µÌºàÌ†µ2Ì±ñ ‚àí Ì†µÌºá2Ì†µÌ±ñ )Ô∏Ä /Ì†µÌ±Ö2, which is the area, where the data rate
is used divided by the total area of the circle.

Secondly, we consider the transmission of two motes, Mote 0 and Mote 1, and Ô¨Ånd the probability WÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ,Ì∞∫1Ì†µÌ±ä of Mote 0 signal being more powerful than Mote 1 signal:

WÌ†µÌ†µÌ±ñ,Ì∞∫1Ì†µÌ±ä = P (Ô∏ÄÌ†µÌ±§1Ì†µÌ∞∫ < Ì†µÌ±§0Ì†µÌ∞∫ ‚àí Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±Ö)Ô∏Ä =

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
To evaluate the performance of LoRaWAN networks, we consider EU 863-880 MHz ISM band with three default channels for data transmission and one downlink channel. We simulate a network with 1000 motes and compare the average PER with one obtained with our mathematical model. The results are shown in Fig. 4. We show two opposite cases, the Ô¨Årst one is Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±Ö ‚Üí ‚àû, which means that collision always happens if two frames

Network load, frames per second

Fig. 4: Dependency of PER on the network load

intersect in time in one channel, and both frames are damaged in this case. Such results completely align with the results of a model from [10], which does not take capture effect into account. The second case is Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±Ö = 0, which means that the frame always passes if its power is greater than interference plus thermal noise. From Fig. 4 we can see that our model accurately predicts Ì†µÌ±É Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±Ö for any Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±Ö value.
According to numerical results, Ì†µÌ±É Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±Ö, calculated by taking into account the capture effect can be up to 50% lower than the one calculated with traditional ALOHA approach. As the result, the estimated maximal load supported by the network without exceeding the given Ì†µÌ±É Ì†µÌ∞∏Ì†µÌ±Ö, can be up to 100% higher.
Numerical results also show that we correctly estimate Ì†µÌºÜ*, and that our upper bound on model accuracy is better than Ì†µÌºÜ*Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±ôÌ†µÌ±ë, which is the bound found in [10].
VI. CONCLUSION
In the paper, we consider LoRaWAN networks with class A devices operating in acknowledged mode. We have extended the model from [10] to accurately describe data transmission process, taking into account the difference between power of the signal from different devices and considering the capture effect. We have developed a general model which can be used to evaluate performance of LoRaWAN networks in different scenarios, and

also describe a speciÔ¨Åc case, when the propagation losses
are described by Okumura-Hata model. We provide the
bound on network load for which our model provides
correct results and show that the extended model is
more accurate than the previous one. This model can
be used as a tool for future research related to power
and spreading factor allocation in LoRaWAN networks,
for parameter optimization and development of more
advanced channel access schemes.
