Proposed Architecture – Predictive SD-IoT
§Performance Specification module: it accepts the requirements from the
user and translates such requirements into an objective function (e.g. fairness).

§Measurement module: it is based on the ONOS REST APIs which are
used to collect the amount of traffic traversing each link of the network

§Prediction module: it includes the LSTM-ANNs used for predicting
network patterns

Proposed Architecture – ANN
§We used Long Short-Term Memory ANN in the prediction module as it is
regarded as the State of the Art for time series prediction.
§In our case we used LSTM-ANNs with 3 layers: 4 neurons in the input
layer (one for each variable considered: day of the week, hour of the day, holiday, no. of generated packets) 50 neurons in the hidden layer, and one neuron in the output layer.

Routing Strategy

§where w is the weight of the edge between nodes x and y,
§p(y) is the amount of packets sent by the node y, as predicted by the
LSTM-ANN,
§a is the tuning parameter imposed by the performance specification
module based on the user’s preferences.

Conclusions
§We have presented a general architecture for an SD-IoT management
system based on a LSTM-ANN. We tested our approach on a real dataset inside a simulated environment.
§The proposed solution aims at providing the starting point for a wider
declarative, SDN-based, predictive flow rule instantiation system
