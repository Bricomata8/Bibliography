Low Packet Loss and High PDR based Self Adaptive Sleep Wake Scheduling Technique for WSN

    Aarushee Garg
    Kshitiz Saxena

Abstract

Abstract— Wireless Sensor Networks consisting of
nodes with limited power are deployed to gather
useful information from the field. In WSNs it is
critical to collect the information in an efficient
manner. It is applied in routing and difficult power
supply area that cannot be reached and some
temporary situations, which do not need fixed
network supporting and it can fast deploy with strong
anti-damage. In order to avoid the problem, we
proposed a new technique called Bio-Inspired
mechanism for routing. Proposed algorithm shows
better performance in terms of Packet Loss and
Delay.

Keywords: Scheduling; routing; delay; optimization
