A Cross-Layer Architecture of Wireless Sensor Networks for Target Tracking
Liang Song, Member, IEEE, and Dimitrios Hatzinakos, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—We propose the Low Energy Self-Organizing Protocol (LESOP) for target tracking in dense wireless sensor networks. A cross-layer design perspective is adopted in LESOP for high protocol efﬁciency, where direct interactions between the Application layer and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer are exploited. Unlike the classical Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) paradigm of communication networks, the Transport and Network layers are excluded in LESOP to simplify the protocol stack. A lightweight yet efﬁcient target localization algorithm is proposed and implemented, and a Quality of Service (QoS) knob is found to control the tradeoff between the tracking error and the network energy consumption. Furthermore, LESOP serves as the ﬁrst example in demonstrating the migration from the OSI paradigm to the Embedded Wireless Interconnect (EWI) architecture platform, a two-layer efﬁcient architecture proposed here for wireless sensor networks.
Index Terms—Application layer, embedded wireless interconnect, medium access control, open systems interconnect, target tracking, wireless sensor networks.
I. INTRODUCTION
ADVANCES in low-power electronics design have made it possible to develop highly integrated, yet low cost, microsensor nodes, with the capabilities of sensing, processing, and wireless communications. Once deployed, a network of thousands of these low-power micro-sensor nodes is expected to operate over years. Due to a large number of potential civil and military applications, a growing research interest has been directed in developing energy efﬁcient self-organizing protocols for wireless sensor networks [1].
The unique nature of sensor networks, which are application speciﬁc and energy-resource limited, poses challenges in the network architecture design. Traditionally, wireless networks architecture is divided into hierarchical layers, based on the OSI architecture paradigm of computer networks [2]. However, in sensor networks, optimizations over the fundamental tradeoff between application speciﬁc QoS gain and energy cost suggest the breaking of OSI hierarchical layers, which has come to be known as “cross-layer design”.
In this paper, we consider the development of a dense wireless sensor network for target tracking applications. The Low Energy Self-Organizing Protocol (LESOP) is developed, which is based on the following considerations.

A. Network QoS and Energy Consumption
The fundamental design tradeoff in wireless sensor networks is between application-speciﬁc QoS gain and energy consumption cost. For target tracking speciﬁcally, network QoS is decided by the tracking error, which is deﬁned by the average target location estimation error. Under the assumption of uniform target distribution, the sensor networks lifetime under consideration is solely decided by the network energy consumption, which is the sum of the energy consumption on all sensor nodes. Thus, the fundamental design tradeoff can be more explicitly presented by the tradeoff between the tracking error and the network energy consumption.
B. Low-Complexity Signal Processing Requirement
The processing capability of micro-sensor nodes is usually highly limited due to limitations from energy resource and cost. This hampers the implementation of complicated signal processing algorithms on sensor nodes. Yet, a fully distributed, lightweight target localization/tracking algorithm is demanded.
C. Scalability
Since sensor networks are composed of thousands, or more, micro-sensor nodes, scalability in sensor network protocols is an important requirement. This suggests that protocol complexity should remain constant as node density increases. Moreover, it would be impossible for individual sensor nodes to obtain global information about the network. Also it is reasonable that, under dense deployment and dynamic environments, the knowledge of the network neighborhood may also be unavailable.
D. Event and Location Centric
Unlike traditional data communication networks, sensor networks are usually not address-centric. An individual sensor node generally does not have a globally unique ID in the network. For target tracking applications speciﬁcally, the data communication is event and location centric. Event centric suggests that network operation and wireless data exchange are triggered by events, i.e., the target detection in the interested region. Location centric suggests that the destination of wireless packets would be the nodes within a speciﬁc location region instead of one particular node. The two properties are compatible, in the sense that wireless communication takes place around the detected target location.
E. Separable Functionalities
The speciﬁc sensor network functionalities are the generation of track information and the delivery to a collector/sink. However, the two can be separately implemented. In the paper, we are only concerned with the track information generation,

which can be deemed as high-level event acquisition, as compared with raw data acquisition. The latter part, on the other hand, can be implemented by diverse schemes, such as geographical forwarding [3], [36] or Sensor Networks with Mobile Sinks (MSSN) [30], under different latency assumptions.
Under the above application-speciﬁc considerations, we develop the LESOP protocol by jointly designing the Application layer and the MAC layer. On the other hand, the Transport layer and the Network layer, which are important components of traditional communication network architectures, are removed. As detailed later, all the radio packets are simply broadcasted to the source node neighborhood wirelessly. In a sense, LESOP demonstrates the attributes of Connectionless Networking. Connectionless Networking [4], which has attracted research interest recently, mostly in military applications, advocates the consolidation of OSI layers headers and improving the energy efﬁciency by excluding initial link acquisition and shared routing information. More importantly, the cross-layer design in wireless sensor networks suggests the necessities of developing the new architecture for replacing the existing OSI paradigm [5], which should be visioned as revolutionary. Thus, we propose the Embedded Wireless Interconnect (EWI) as the potential universal architecture for sensor networks design. EWI is built on two layers, which are the System layer and the Wireless Link layer, respectively. The bottom Wireless Link layer supplies the library of wireless transmission modules to the upper System layer. The System layer judiciously decides the organization of the wireless links by exploiting the tradeoff between application-speciﬁc QoS gain and energy consumption expenditure. LESOP is shown as the ﬁrst example demonstrating the paradigm migration from OSI to EWI in wireless sensor networks. We are able to identify explicitly the System layer and Wireless Link layer in LESOP, where the interaction interface between the two layers is also found concretely.
Next, under a target physical signal attenuation model, a lowcomplexity target localization algorithm is proposed and implemented in LESOP. A QoS knob is employed in the Application layer, which decides the tradeoff between the target tracking error and the network energy consumption. The proposed protocol is fully scalable, since no global information or even the network neighborhood information is assumed at individual sensor nodes. Both analytical and simulation results show that LESOP achieves the desired application-speciﬁc properties.
In Section II, a literature survey is provided. Section III introduces the model assumptions. The LESOP protocol is described at high level in Section IV, and designed from a crosslayer perspective in Section V. Simulation results are provided in Section VI. The vision of the EWI platform is suggested in Section VII, where LESOP is shown as a design example. Discussions and conclusions are presented in Section VIII and Section IX, respectively.
II. RELATED WORK
Target localization/tracking has been considered as one of the major applications of wireless sensor networks. Most existing references have been focused on the Application layer and the Network layer.

The study on target source localization has a long history. A classiﬁcation of existing approaches is based on a variety of different physical measurements, such as TOA/TDOA (Time of Arrival/Time Difference of Arrival) [6], AOA (Angle of Arrival) [7], and energy-based measurement [8]. In sensor networks, target localization can also be achieved by merely one bit detected/undetcted information from sensor nodes [9]. A target localization protocol with energy-efﬁciency considerations was developed in [10] for sensor networks.
For target tracking sensor networks, research efforts have been focused on the handover of target tracking duty among leader nodes (or cluster heads). Zhao et al. proposed the IDSQ (Information Driven Sensor Querying) in [11] and [12], where a leader sensor node is intelligently selecting the best neighbor node to perform sensing and serve as the next leader. A cost function was employed by jointly considering the energy expenditure and information gain. Based on a similar idea, in [13], Wang et al. applied the Baysian SMC (Sequential Monte Carlo) methods to the problem of optimal sensor selection and fusion in target tracking. These approaches require that individual sensor nodes process detailed information about all nodes in neighborhood, such as the location and residual energy level, which limits the protocol scalability. Moreover, the complexity of node selection algorithms might impose high constraints on sensor node processing capability.
Brooks et al. proposed location centric CSP (Collaborative Signal Processing) approaches for target tracking sensor networks in [14] and [15], where a selected region instead of an individual sensor node is activated. The location-centric proposal shares the same intuition as LESOP. However, since they are focused on upper layers (application and network) design, it is unclear how the CSP methods can be efﬁcient implemented in wireless sensor networks. Moreover, energy efﬁciency was not considered in the work of CSP. Zhang et al. proposed optimized tree reconﬁguration for target tracking networks in [16], which is concentrated on the Network layer domain, and shaped by the tracking application requirements. Potential optimization in lower layers, however, was also not considered.
Related work also includes the coverage of sensor networks, where the goal is to ﬁnd a small set of sensor nodes covering the interested surveillance region. In [17] and [18], deterministic protocols were proposed to achieve this goal, which are based on the distributed information exchange among sensor nodes. In this paper, however, we adopt a probabilistic approach under a detection time-delay parameter, which requires no inter-node information exchange. Compared with other probabilistic proposals [19], more explicit results are obtained in this paper.
Moreover, energy efﬁcient MAC layer designs for general sensor networks can be found in PAMAS [20], S-MAC [21], T-MAC [22], and SIFT [23]. Compared with these works, in LESOP, we show how the application-speciﬁc requirements can shape the MAC design. It is also interesting to compare LESOP with LEACH [24] to show that different application requirements lead to totally different design considerations. LEACH is an energy-aware cluster head selection mechanism for environmental monitoring sensor networks, which assumes that sensor nodes continuously have data for transmission.

III. MODEL ASSUMPTIONS
We assume single target tracking in the paper. Extensions to co-located multiple targets tracking is discussed in Section VIII-C. Under the assumption of uniform target distribution, load balancing in sensor networks is also achieved automatically by localized processing. For easy reference, Table I provides a list of parameters and variables notation used in the paper. Typical values of the parameters are also given.
A. Node Deploying Model
Consider a large number of sensor nodes randomly deployed over the surveillance region, where denotes the location coordinates of node . As long as that the number of sensor nodes is large, the node distribution can be modelled as a homogeneous Poisson process [25] with the node density . That is, given an area of the size in the ﬁeld, the number of nodes in the area,
, follows Poisson distribution with parameter , i.e.,
(1)

Note that the LESOP protocol does not necessarily depend on this model. The Poisson model is however useful in the analysis.

Sensors convert the target physical signal to an electric signal.

The target is supposed to be moving in the surveillance region.

Let

[29]

(8) where

LESOP sensor nodes are assumed to be equipped with two

radios, a primary RF radio, and a secondary wakeup radio.

Let

denote the range of both radios. An important

assumption is that the radio range is two times larger than the

sensing range. Further discussion on the assumption appears in

Section VIII-A.

The primary radio is used for routine wireless data packet

transmission. Its transmitting power and rate are assumed to be

ﬁxed. Let denote the rate. We further assume that channel

Error Control Coding (ECC) ensures the correct radio packet

decoding in the case of noncollision. Primary radio can be

working in three distinct modes, transmitting, receiving/idle, or

sleeping. Let the node power consumption in transmitting and

recieving/idle modes be denoted by and , respectively.

The sleeping mode power consumption is practically 1000

times smaller than and , which is negligible.

The secondary wakeup radio [20], [26], [27] can only send or

detect busy tones. Due to the simpliﬁed functionalities, wakeup

radio can be designed of super low power consumption, which

is around 1 W in active monitoring mode. This can be achieved

either by special hardware design [26], or very low duty cycle

[27]. The power consumption of wakeup radio is hence of the

same level as the sleeping mode of primary radio, which is also

negligible. Furthermore, in the following, we also assume that

the wakeup radio has the capability of sending/detecting busy

tones at two separate frequencies, which are denoted by and

, respectively.

IV. HIGH LEVEL LESOP PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION

We propose a low-complexity processing algorithm for target

tracking, which is based on the sensor measurements

.

At time , a leader sensor node, forces all its neighboring

nodes to perform sensing, by broadcasting a busy tone through

the wakeup radio. Initially, is deﬁned as the sensor node who

ﬁrst detects the target. Assume that nodes (neighboring )

have detected the target at time . Further, let denote the set

The above idea is illustrated in Fig. 1. Several problems need

to be further clariﬁed. First, what is the target location esti-

mation mechanism based on detection information fusion, and

what is the exchanged detection information? Second, how are

the leader node and the set selected from in a self-or-

D. High Level Protocol Summary
Table II summarizes the high level LESOP protocol description, which is an iterative procedure for target tracking.

V. CROSS-LAYER LESOP PROTOCOL DESIGN
The system module architecture of LESOP node is shown in Fig. 2. The modules are named following the OSI tradition.

Fig. 2. LESOP modules.
However, as to be discussed later, in Section VII, the LESOP architecture virtually conforms to the proposed two-layer EWI platform.
Inter-module information exchanges are done by messages. On the other hand, inter-node communications are done by packets and busy tones. Packets go through the primary radio, while busy tones are sent by the secondary wakeup radio. We further deﬁne the set of inter-module messages, inter-node packets/tones, and module states for LESOP in Table III. For wireless communications speciﬁcally, the Transport and Network layer are omitted to simplify the protocol stack. All the radio packets have one source address, which is the location coordinates of the source sensor node. However, they do not have a destination address, and are wirelessly broadcasted to the source neighborhood.
A. Application Layer
The role of the Application layer is the overall control of the node functionalities. All the inter-node communications (packets or busy tones) start and end at the particular node Application layer. It can be in one of the following four states,

where

(28)

Fig. 3. Application layer states diagram.

IDLE, WAIT, HEADI, HEADII. The state transfer diagram is

shown in Fig. 3.

1) IDLE State: In IDLE state, it is assumed that the target is

undetected in the neighborhood region of the node. Note that ini-

tially all the deployed sensor nodes are in IDLE state. The Appli-

cation layer periodically polls the sensor (sending SEN_POLL

message) and read the sensing measurement

(retrieving

SEN_MEASURE message). This time period, , indicates

how fast the target can be detected after appearing in the surveil-

lance region. More speciﬁcally, let the random variable de-

note the detection delay, which is the time difference between

the time the target appears, and the ﬁrst time that the target is

detected. The expected value of ,

, can be shown

upper bounded by (see Appendix I)

(27)

Once the target is detected

, the Applica-

tion layer sends through the wakeup radio the busy tone ,

and transfers to HEADI state. forces all the neighboring

sensor nodes become active. On the other hand, if arrives

ﬁrst, the Application layer sends SEN_POLL and transfers to

WAIT state.

2) Wait State: In WAIT state, the Application layer ﬁrst

retrieves SEN_MEASURE message from the sensor. If the

measurement

, it simply returns to IDLE state at

the end of the track interval

. Otherwise, if

,

is calculated locally by (19). is then included in the

DEC_INFO packet and forwarded to the MAC layer.

The ﬁrst busy tone indicates that the leader node has

been elected in the neighborhood. When the DEC_READY

message is received from the MAC layer, the speciﬁc node

becomes , if has not been elected. Correspondingly,

the Application layer transfers to HEADII state, and sends

DEC_CANCEL message to the MAC layer to cancel the cur-

rent DEC_INFO packet. On the other hand, if it is known that

has been elected upon receiving DEC_READY, the Ap-

plication layer replies to the MAC layer with the conﬁrmation

DEC_SET message.

The second busy tone indicates that the target location

estimation procedure has ended. When it arrives, the Applica-

tion layer sends DEC_CANCEL message to the MAC layer, and

transfers to IDLE state.

3) HEADI State: In HEADI state, the node behaves as the

node. The Application layer waits for the second busy tone

from the wakeup radio. Once the desired arrives, it sends

TRACK_INFO packet through the primary radio, and waits for

the acknowledge, TRACK_ACK packet, from node. After

the exchange, the Application layer goes to the IDLE state.

152

IEEE/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING, VOL. 15, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2007

If the second does not arrive within the track interval limit

, the node decides that the target has disappeared or errors

have occurred. Application layer transfers to IDLE state, and the

track record is then forwarded to the sink by other mechanisms.

4) HEADII State: In HEADII state, the node behaves as the

node. First, busy tone is broadcasted through the wakeup

radio, which announces that has been elected. RADIO_ACT

message is then sent to set the Physical layer in RECEIVE/IDLE

state (turning on primary radio).

The Application layer receives DEC_INFO packets from the

neighborhood in sequence. The detection information fusion

process is then executed as described in Table II. Once the ter-

minating condition (26) is met, or the track interval time limit

is reached, the target location is estimated by (10). The

second is then broadcasted through the wakeup radio, indi-

cating that the estimation procedure has ﬁnished.

After the broadcasting of the second , the Application

layer waits for TRACK_INFO packet from , and responds

with the acknowledge, TRACK_ACK packet. The Application

layer then sends a RADIO_SLE message to set the Physical

layer in SLEEP state (turning off primary radio). When the track

interval time

is reached, is broadcasted though the

wakeup radio, and the Application layer transfers to HEADI

state.

B. MAC Layer
Upon receiving the forwarded DEC_INFO packet from the Application layer, the MAC layer calculates a time delay for the DEC_INFO packet. Intuitively, the delay is inversely proportional to the of the speciﬁc DEC_INFO packet. By denoting the speciﬁc delay, we set
(29)
where is a preset constant, satisfying

(30)

In (30),

is the maximum value of the delay under consid-

eration. Due to (19),

is obtained only when reaches

its minimum. The delay mechanism of

ensures that the

node with highest would be elected as the leader node , by

(23). It also ensures that the set of nodes, , are of the highest

, as described in the rule of (22).

Speciﬁcally, the MAC layer waits until the expiration of

the time delay

to perform radio carrier sensing. If the

primary radio channel is busy, the MAC layer waits for another

time delay,

, which is the DEC_INFO packet trans-

mission delay. When the radio channel is free, DEC_READY

is sent to the Application layer. If the response is DEC_SET,

the DEC_INFO packet is forwarded to Physical layer and

broadcasted. Otherwise, if the Application layer response is

DEC_CANCEL, the DEC_INFO packet is deleted in MAC.

TABLE IV MAC LAYER PROCESSING OF DEC_INFO PACKET

This procedure is summarized in Table IV. Moreover, at any-

time when DEC_CANCEL message is received, the current

DEC_INFO packet awaiting in the buffer is deleted.

Upon receiving TRACK_INFO or TRACK_ACK packets

from the Application layer, the MAC performs radio car-

rier sensing, and waits until the radio channel is free. The

TRACK_INFO or TRACK_ACK packets are then forwarded

to the Physical layer and broadcasted. The MAC layer also

forwards all the received packets from the Physical layer to the

Application layer.

Note that a collision of DEC_INFO packets can occur when,

for two nodes and ,

.

This is the maximum propagation delay of radio packets in air.

Since

is small in sensor networks, the collision proba-

bility is practically small. Moreover, the LESOP protocol is vir-

tually robust to the collision, since can ignore the collision,

and wait for the next successfully received DEC_INFO packet.

Furthermore, we also assign the channel error control coding

(ECC) functionality to the MAC layer. Note that traditionally,

ECC is deﬁned at Data Link layer, and MAC is a sub-layer of

Data Link layer. This contradiction is virtually nonimportant

here, and provides us with an efﬁcient way of presentation.

C. Physical Layer, Wakeup Radio, and Sensor

The Physical layer of primary radio is responsible for broad-

casting the radio packets to the node’s neighborhood, which in

our simpliﬁed model is a circular region with radius

. It

also supplements carrier sensing capability to MAC layer, and

detects radio packets collision on primary radio. As described

in the model of Section III-C, the Physical layer can be in one

of the three states, TRANSMIT, RECEIVE/IDLE, and SLEEP,

which correspond to the three modes of primary radio, transmit-

ting, receiving/idle, and sleeping, respectively. When receiving

the forwarded packets from the MAC layer, the Physical layer

goes to TRANSMIT state, and returns to the previous state after

transmission. The Application layer can conﬁgure the Physical

layer in RECEIVE/IDLE or SLEEP states, by RADIO_ACT or

RADIO_SLE messages, respectively.

The wakeup radio and the sensor modules are under con-

trol of the Application layer. Wakeup radio broadcasts the

busy tone forwarded from the Application layer, and sends

the detected busy tone to the Application layer. Only upon

receiving SEN_POLL message from Application layer, the

sensor module is activated, senses and replies the measurement

by SEN_MEASURE message.

D. Power Consumption Analysis

1) Network Idle Power Consumption: When the target is not

present, we deﬁne the network idle power consumption

as the average power consumption per square meter

in the surveillance region. Since the energy consumption in one

sensing measurement is

(Section III-B), the power

consumption is

. Given the node density ,

is a constant:

(31)

In (31), the network idle power consumption is inversely

proportional to the parameter . Moreover, in (29), the ex-

pected detection delay

is linearly proportional to .

Hence, decides the tradeoff between the two.

2) Tracking Power Consumption: When the target is present

in the surveillance region, we denote

as the network

power consumption in tracking. Note that the energy con-

sumption of the node, in one iteration of the process

described in Table II, is

communication of DEC_INFO packets, which is controlled

by the QoS knob . By (26),

decreases with . Thus,

a larger reduces power consumption, but increases tracking

error ((21)). The third portion in (35) is the power consumption

during sensing, which increases linearly with the number of

samples . On the other hand, higher results in higher ,

by (19). And higher

results in lower localization error,

by (21).

VI. SIMULATION STUDIES

A. Comparisons in Target Localization

The high level comparisons of target localization algorithms

are performed by simulations using Matlab. Let 80 sensor nodes

be uniformly randomly distributed in a 20 20 m square region.

The target position is also randomly generated in the square. The

parameters values agree with the list in Table I. The simulation

results are averaged over 20000 Monte Carlo runs.

We compare the target localization algorithm in LESOP

with the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) localization. In

contrary to the linear combining in (10) of LESOP, the ML

method is a nonlinear procedure, and is optimal in the sense

of maximum likelihood. The ML estimation of target location

, given

, is

Furthermore, the energy consumption one iteration, is

energy consumption in sensing and transmitting DEC_INFO

packets, which is

(34) Thus,

where is a constant:

(36)

By (35), the power consumption in target tracking,

,

can be divided into three portions. The constant portion

is the power consumption in exchanging “track information”

(TRACK_INFO and TRACK_ACK) between elected leader

the localization error decreases, when increases. This is be-

cause of that measurements are of higher accuracy with larger

when the QoS knob decreases, which agrees with our former

analysis. At the cost of much higher complexity, the ML method

achieves lower localization error than LESOP, which is about

because LESOP generally uses less information in the target location estimation.

B. Network Simulations

LESOP network protocol is simulated via the discrete event

simulation system OMNet++ [28]. Let 500 LESOP nodes be

randomly deployed in a 50 50 square region. The network sim-

ulation time duration is set to be 120 s, and the target appears in

the surveillance square at the time

s, and disappears at the

time

s. Without loss of generality, we further simulate the

target mobility as follows: The target velocity is ﬁxed at 10 m/s,

and the direction is a random variable uniformly distributed in

. The mobility direction is independently updated every

0.5 s, while the generator guarantees that the target would not

move out of the surveillance region in the next time period of

0.5 s. Unless indicated, all the parameters values conform to the

list in Table I. The network simulation results take the average

of 100 Monte Carlo runs.

The network energy consumption of four different conﬁgu-

rations of and are plotted in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, it is easy to

identify the time period from 30 s to 90 s, when the target is

present. The network power consumption takes a much higher

value in the period because

is generally much higher than

s. Both Figs. 6 and 7 show (clearer in Fig. 7) that the net-

work energy consumption increases with and decreases with

, which conﬁrms our previous analysis. In Fig. 7, for a given

, the energy consumption is observed to be linearly increasing

with , which is due to the third term of

in (35). For

a ﬁxed , the variation of network energy consumption over

takes a similar curve as

(Fig. 5), which is due to the

second term of

(35).

Target tracking error is deﬁned as the average target localiza-

tion error in the simulation time period. Fig. 8 shows the tracking

error for different conﬁgurations of and . Similar to the pre-

vious results in Fig. 4, the tracking error generally increases with

, and decreases with . Close examination also reveals that the

curve of

and

are closer to each other, because

the measurement error on

while it is only times from

Finally, Fig. 9 shows the variation of the expected detection

delay

are ﬁxed at 20 and 0.2, respectively. It is observed in Fig. 9 that

increases linearly with . We observe that the sim-

ulation results and the theoretical bound (27) are close. More-

over, it is interesting to see that the simulation results are higher

than the theoretical upper bound in most cases. This may be due

to the boundary effect of square region, which is not taken into

considerations in the derivation of the bound. It also indicates the tightness of the derived bound in (27).1
VII. EMBEDDED WIRELESS INTERCONNECT A. From OSI to EWI
Up to here, we are still using the notations inherited from classical OSI layers, such as Application, MAC, and Physical layers. However, it is easy to realize that LESOP does not even conform to the paradigm of OSI. We propose and advocate the Embedded Wireless Interconnect architecture platform, for replacing the OSI paradigm, in wireless sensor networks. The EWI is composed of two layers, which are the System layer and the Wireless Link layer, respectively. The bottom Wireless Link layer supplies the library of wireless transmission modules to the upper System layer. The System layer judiciously decides the organization of the wireless links by exploiting the tradeoff between application-speciﬁc QoS gain and energy consumption expenditure.
1The LESOP sensor networks OMNet++ simulator is shared at http://www. comm.utoronto.ca/~songl/download/LESOP/sim.zip

Instead of consolidating OSI layers, we deem EWI as revolutionary to the OSI paradigm. The reasons are the two-fold fundamental differences between wireless sensor networks and traditional computer networks. First, data communications in sensor or pervasive computing networks are event-centric, locationcentric, and data-centric. Packets routing is thus necessarily application speciﬁc. Such properties are not found in traditional computer networks, such as Internet, where the OSI paradigm is applied. Second, wireless networks, in general, have been treated as virtual wired networks in past engineering practices, by setting up virtual wired link between two mobile stations within one-hop radio distance. Signiﬁcant improvements on efﬁciency can be achieved, by exploiting the broadcasting nature of wireless medium in wireless link modules. Such efforts, such as cooperative radio transmissions, are ideal for wireless sensor networks, where sensor nodes are deployed for one common interest.
The proposal of EWI is motivated by two trends in wireless sensor networks cross-layer design. More speciﬁcally, System layer is motivated by the ﬁrst trend, which starts from the Application layer, and lets the application-speciﬁc QoS requirements deﬁne the constraints of lower layers design and optimization. The question there is, given the coding and radio communication modules, what is the optimal way to organize various aspects of the network in accomplishing application tasks, so that the network lifetime is maximized. These aspects include, but are not limited to, in-network distributed signal processing, network topology control, routing, ﬂow/congestion control, and security/cost management. Besides LESOP, such examples can also be found in [3], [16], [24], [34], and [36]. On the other hand, Wireless Link layer is motivated by the second trend, which is focused on radio/coding modules. The question there is, given the network communication trafﬁc pattern, what is the optimal strategy of delivering the packets so as to maximize the energy efﬁciency. The research necessarily leads to a compound Data Link layer and Physical layer, for which examples can be found in [30]–[33].
Moreover, a recent theoretical background study [35] also demonstrated that the separate dealing of source coding and channel coding in System layer and Wireless Linker layer, respectively, can achieve the optimal distortion and energy consumption tradeoff in reach-far wireless sensor networks, asymptotically.
The absence of a classical Network layer in EWI will not limit but rather will enhance the scalability to large-scale wireless sensor networks. The classical Network layer practice, on which diverse routing protocols rely, makes the assumption that every node is aware of its network neighborhood. However, this assumption may not hold in large-scale sensor networks, where the “neighborhood” might consist of hundreds of sensor nodes. Moreover, these sensor nodes may fall into sleep, or suffer from failures frequently over time. This suggests that the classical paradigm of network routing might not accommodate the requirements of large-scale sensor and pervasive computing networks, because of the failure of the scalability assumption. On the other hand, the suggested EWI is not constrained by this assumption to coordinate node cooperation at both the application message exchanges level and the physical data communications level, as it is clearly demonstrated by the proposed LESOP.

IEEE/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING, VOL. 15, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2007

B. LESOP: An EWI Example

We show that LESOP virtually agrees ideally with the EWI

architecture platform. In LESOP, the Application layer corre-

sponds to the System layer under EWI. The combination of the

MAC layer and the Physical layer would be the Wireless Link

layer under EWI. Note that in the MAC, there is a application

speciﬁc delay

. Under the new EWI architecture plat-

form, the calculation of

should be shifted to the System

layer. The System layer further attaches an application speciﬁc

time delay parameter to every packet forwarded to the Wireless

Link layer. This parameter is

for DEC_INFO packets,

while it is zero for TRACK_INFO and TRACK_ACK packets.

The System layer also interacts with the Wireless Link layer by

two sets of messages, which are RADIO_ACT/RADIO_SLE,

and DEC_READY/DEC_CANCEL, respectively. The func-

tions of the two sets of messages remain the same. Thus,

in LESOP, we are able to identify the clear deﬁnitions of

the System, and Wireless Link layers, and also the interface

between the two. LESOP ideally ﬁts in the EWI architecture

platform without any further modiﬁcations.

Furthermore, in sensor networks practice, System layer

needs to be at least divided into two parallel sub-layers. The

ﬁrst sub-layer deals with in-network signal processing for high

level event acquisition, e.g., LESOP and [34]. The second

sub-layer deals with the sink event query/subscription and

delivery [3], [30], [36]. It is worthwhile to note that in [36],

the similar interaction between the Application (System) layer

and the MAC/Physical (Wireless Link) layer is utilized, as in

LESOP, i.e., the application speciﬁc time delay parameter.

Although the generality of EWI is still in the pre-mature

stage, it is under active investigation. In our vision, the EWI fu-

ture directions can be grouped into the following two categories.

• By studying energy efﬁcient ways of wireless link com-

munications under different conditions, the objective is set

for developing a standard wireless link modules library for

System layer engineers. The abstracted category of wire-

less links can be broadcast [32], peer-to-peer unicast [31],

to-sink unicast [30], [33], or multicast/anycast in an area.

The associated module parameters need to include latency,

rate, outage probability, range, and energy consumption.

• By investigating efﬁcient network architectures of different

applications, the objective is set for deﬁning the uniﬁed

interface syntax between System layer and Wireless Link

layer. The objective here is also to develop efﬁcient col-

laborative signal processing algorithms in distributed net-

works. This provides the set of design methodologies for

System designers. For example, the design of LESOP also

suggests a state centric programming [38] strategy in the

event acquisition sub-layer of the System layer.

In general, the described delay

in LESOP, deﬁned in

the interface syntax between the System layer and the Wireless

Link layer, is an application speciﬁc parameter which decides

the packet scheduling in the broadcast wireless link module.

VIII. DISCUSSIONS
A. Radio Range and Sensing Range In the LESOP design, it is assumed that the radio range, , is two times larger than the sensing range. The as-

sumption keeps the nodes set

, i.e., target

detection nodes, within the

of each other. It also keeps

the set within the

of , i.e.,

,

provided the velocity constraint in Section VIII-B.

Note that sensing range is not explicitly given in the model

deﬁnition. It is decided by a group of parameters, i.e., ,

, , and the source signal . The radio range,

, on

the other hand, is not necessarily the single hop distance, and

is determined by the speciﬁc Wireless Link layer implementa-

tion. Although multi-hop radio communications are tradition-

ally well understood in the OSI Network layer, nevertheless, it

can be implemented in Physical layer as well [32]. If single hop

radio distance is smaller than sensing range, such Physical layer

ﬁring proposals are ideal for LESOP, because there would be no

packet level delay incurred in consecutive hops. Then, Physical

(Wireless Link) layer ﬁring is automatically conﬁned within the

local activated region.

B. Target Moving Velocity

Let denote the maximum target velocity. The constraint

on is that

.

Provided that the radio range,

, is two times larger

than the sensing range, the constraint ensures that the nodes set

falls in the

of . However, if the

constraint is not satisﬁed, the following two conditions can take

place. First, if

,

the tracking error can be ampliﬁed, because an incomplete set of

nodes is utilized in information fusion. Second, if

, the target can be missed during the tracking

process. Another event record will be generated when the target

is detected again by sensor nodes elsewhere.

In real world implementation, the parameter

can be

adaptively updated, according to the current estimation of target

velocity.

C. Multiple Targets Tracking
Although most research efforts have been focused on single target tracking, multiple targets tracking also has been receiving a lot of interests. Generally, if multiple targets can be differentiated in time or space, then single target tracking protocol can work efﬁciently. If the condition is not satisﬁed, Li et al. [37] proposed the implementation of target classiﬁcation algorithms on individual sensor nodes.
In the paper, we have only discussed single target tracking. We suggest that the multiple targets tracking problem can be solved in a similar way as [37], provided that multiple orthogonal radio channels are available, e.g., by TDMA or FDMA. When co-located multiple targets are present, the tracking of different targets can then operate on different channels concurrently, provided that the sensor nodes can classify the intrusion targets. Particularly, by modifying the LESOP implementation, the node needs to probe for a vacant channel, and broadcast the target characteristics in that particular channel, after having sent the beacon.

D. Coexistence Issues
As previously stated in Section VII, the System layer in sensor networks need be at least of two sub-layers, which deal with the high level event acquisition and the delivery, respectively. For target tracking sensor networks, speciﬁcally, the target tracking sub-layer, such as in LESOP, needs to

157

operate concurrently with the other sub-layer, i.e., the intrusion event query/delivery. Orthogonal channels (or separate radios) can enable the coexistence of the two parallel sub-layers. If half-duplex radio and real-time delivery are employed or required, System layer designers might need also to decide the associated priority between the particular two sub-layers for radio occupation.

IX. CONCLUSION

We have proposed LESOP for target tracking in wireless

sensor networks, based on a holistic cross-layer design per-

spective. Linear processing is employed for target location

estimation. Compared with the optimal nonlinear estimation,

the proposed linear processing achieves signiﬁcantly lower

complexity, which makes it suitable for sensor networks imple-

mentation. A QoS knob coefﬁcient is found in optimizing the

fundamental tradeoff. Moreover, the protocol is fully scalable

because the fusion coefﬁcient

(in (19)) is calculated

locally on individual sensor nodes. Additionally, the tradeoff

between the detection time-delay

and the network idle

power consumption is found in (29) and (31), where the

parameter is utilized to control this tradeoff.

In the protocol design of LESOP, direct interactions between

the top Application layer and the bottom MAC/Physical layers

were exploited. The traditional Network layer and Transport

layer have been removed, thus simplifying the protocol stack.

Some traditional functionalities of the two layers are merged

into the top and the bottom layers. Embedded Wireless Intercon-

nect is then proposed as the potential universal architecture for

sensor networks design. Although the generality of EWI needs

further investigation and deﬁnition, LESOP is shown as an ex-

ample that ﬁts ideally the EWI description. As such, it sheds

light on the paradigm migration from OSI to EWI.
