IoT in B2B, Industrial Internet. The third revolution.

The revolution: rise of the industrial InteIIrI.nWaevets of Innovation and Change

Over the last 200 years, the world has

IoT revolution : experienced several waves of innovation. Successful companies learned to navigate

these waves and adapt to the changing

• 

Smart Objects environment. Today we are at the cusp of another wave of innovation that promises to

change the way we do business and interact

• 

Internet of Things with the world of industrial machines. To fully understand what is taking place today,

it is useful to review how we got here and

• 

Big Data Analysis how past innovations have set the stage for the next wave we are calling the “Industrial

Internet .”

The First Wave: The Industrial Revolution
The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on society, the economy and culture of the world. It was a long process of innovation that spanned a period of 150 years between 1750 and 1900. During this

period, innovations in technology applied to manufacturing, energy production, transportation and agriculture ushered in a period of economic growth and transformation. The ﬁrst stage started in the mid-eighteenth century with the commercialization of the steam engine. The Industrial Revolution started in Northern Europe, which at the time was the most productive economy, and spread to the United States, where railways played a crucial role in accelerating economic development.1 The second surge came later, in 1870, but was even more powerful, bringing us the internal combustion engine, electricity and a host of other useful machines.
The Industrial Revolution changed the way we lived: it brought about a profound transformation in transportation (from the horse-carriage and the sailboat to the railways, steamboats and trucks); in communication (telephone and telegraph); in urban centers (electricity, running water, sanitation and medicine). It dramatically transformed living standards and health conditions.2

Within the developed economies, industry represents roughly 24 percent of output,

The Industrial Internet will encompass a broader array of sectors than captured by conventional economic categories. For example, it will also engage large swaths of the transport sector including:

The war: traditionnal industries vs native IoT players
Market access Market legitimacy Technology acceptance
Product & service innovation Market diﬀerentiation
Better informed decision making
Most of the Industrial Internet Market belong to traditional players. IoT technologies are not disruptive for the industries but instead they operate as an enabler: they open new perspectives to existing industries and give existing players the opportunity to leap across the frontiers of their current exercise.

Why do we need testbeds ? (1) From idea to proof of coHnIcKeOBptFOX
•  Because we need to innovate, we have to concretize ideas into proof of concepts.
•  Services expected: engineering support to make the technology accessible
•  Value: speed and easyness of concept validation, which translate into a shorter time-to-market.
•  Targets: product manufacturers, integrators, service & application providers // they know the application & service, not necessarily the technology // they neeed help to see what the technology can do.

Why do we need testbeds ? (1) Prototype / product testing and validation

•  Because we do hardware/software, we need testing and operational validation.
•  Because we sell real systems to real people operating them in real conditions, the testbed should somehow be « in vivo », not only « in vitro »
•  Services expected: in vivo, close to what the product will experience, with the capability to experience many conditions.
•  Value: space of testing conditions / paramters (e.g. scale, etc.)
•  Targets: product/software manufacturer // they now the technology // they want to play in conditions they don’t have!

CONCLUSION
Strong interest in testbed to: •  Confront a concept to the reality of the technology •  Test and validate prototypes / products in speciﬁc conditions
But: •  What is the service brought with the testbed ? •  It is IoT-native players oriented or traditional industries oriented ?
They know the application, we bring them the technology.
Next step: •  Develop the programming tools to smartly spread the data processing and
the conﬁguration among the diﬀerent system components.
They know the application, we bring them the tools to play with the technology.
