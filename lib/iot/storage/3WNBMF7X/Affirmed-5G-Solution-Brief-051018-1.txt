A rmed Networks Delivers Industry's First 5G Mobile Core The Challenge
investments are needed to achieve sustainable business growth. The arrival of 5G will fundamentally alter the amount and type of as the network scales, operators can unleash higher quality and and delivery will be improved by four times today’s rate through third-party applications ensures that content can be consumed
The Solution: 5G... Now
The arrival of 5G requires operators to support signiﬁcantly more tra c, devices, and service types than ever before.
Figure 1: A rmed 5G Mobile Core
The A rmed Networks’ 5G Mobile Core, built on a web-scale architecture, enables rapid delivery of new services and unlimited scale that operators require to provide outstanding service levels, self-service functionality, and faster activation times.

Figure 2: Capture Real-time Granular Analytics Using Integrated Virtual Probe
This 5G experience begins with integrated virtual probes that are providing real-time intelligence and service assurance via Affirmed Networks’ vProbe and Analytics solution. With greater understanding of network and service utilization, operators can then automate service provisioning via Affirmed Networks’ ASAP across legacy, virtualized, and multi-vendor environments. Fine-grained network slicing with the Affirmed Virtual Slice Selection Function delivers a “one-touch” centralized function that transparently inserts into existing networks, requiring no configuration changes, making it easy to build network slices across any network. This is reinforced with a cloud native microservices architecture and customized policies (ex. Gi LAN Services) that enable focused delivery of new services or changes to specific customer policies based on preferences, devices, or other factors.

With ubiquity in mind, the Affirmed 5G mobile core functions across multi-access networks – cellular, WiFi, and fixed line, including support for 5G New Radio (NR), the new global 5G radio standard that provides major performance, cost and efficiency improvements over previous wireless technologies. A distributed control and user plane separation (CUPS) architecture supports high bandwidth, low latency applications, and edge computing that offers a 10x performance advantage over current industry offerings, delivering up to 150 Gbps throughput on a single x86 Intel Xeon Processor.
