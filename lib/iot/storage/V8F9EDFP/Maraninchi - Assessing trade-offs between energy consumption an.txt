Two Sub-Questions

Energy Consumption

Security

1 How to evaluate energy consumption of a complete HW/SW solution? 2 How to deﬁne and implement measurable security? In such a way that we trust simulations/experiments.

We worked on points 1 and 2 in the ANR ARESA and ARESA2 projects, with Orange Labs; and also on point 1 in the ANR HELP project, with STMicroelectronics.

The SR3 Protocol: “Expected” Attackers
Dolev-Yao principles for security = the attacker is the strongest we can imagine, the only thing it cannot do is decrypt a message without the key.

The SR3 Protocol: “Expected” Attackers
Dolev-Yao principles for security = the attacker is the strongest we can imagine, the only thing it cannot do is decrypt a message without the key.

Such a powerful attacker of a WSN will always win.

Weaker attackers considered: “normal” nodes (w.r.t. HW capabilities) whose SW has been compromised Example: a node can start behaving as a blackhole at some point in time.
Expected properties of SR3: if there are not too many such nodes, the protocol will maintain a good delivery rate, at a reasonable cost.

The SR3 Protocol: Simulations with Sinalgo
(A distributed algorithm simulator, ETH Zu¨rich)

A node that has acquired a good reputation turns into a blackhole: the delivery rate drops, and then SR3 recovers. Size of the reputation list: if increased, better routes, longer time to recover.

The SR3 Protocol: Energy Consumption
For the moment, the Sinalgo models are based on 2 important hypotheses: The radio channel and the MAC layer provide the routing level with an ideal platform (no collisions) Energy consumption is directly related to messages (number of messages sent, length of the routes)

After Some Thought...
Very important impact of the attacker’s position: — Where to put the attacker to make it as strong as possible? An idea: We would like the honest nodes to suﬀer from the realistic channel, but NOT the attackers!

November 6, 2014 15 / 23

The More Details, The Better?
The more details you can put in a reasonably fast simulation, the better? No, because: — More details means less understandable results — More details in the execution environment (HW+channel+attackers) make it more particular, hence the SW is less robust/secure.

Exagerating Unfriendliness of the Execution Environment
(1) Exagerating Unfriendliness of the HW platform:
— The very goal of “transaction-level modeling” (TLM) for systems-on-a-chip. — Feasible even though the REAL object code runs on rather abstract HW models (bit-accurate models)
Example with two timers:
Embedded SW:
start timer 1 delay 10 start timer 2 delay 20 wait expiration 1 wait expiration 2

Example with two timers:

Embedded SW:
start timer 1 delay 10 start timer 2 delay 20 wait expiration 1 wait expiration 2

HW models of increasing unfriendliness: 1) exact timing: 10, 20 2) loose timing: [8,12], [18,22] 3) no timing: one day, one day

If even loose timing is considered too friendly, then untimed models are the only choice to guarantee SW robustness.

Exagerating Unfriendliness of the Execution Environment
(2) Exagerating unfriendliness of the attackers in a WSN?
We could imagine a mixed simulation mode in which: — The honest nodes play by the rules, i.e. they suﬀer from the imperfections of the radio channel+MAC — The attackers don’t play by the rule, i.e., for them the transmission is perfect.

Conclusion (1)
We are quite far from trusting views like:

Energy Consumption Lifetime

Security

We need frameworks in which we can think in terms of our solution/the execution environment, i.e., the adversary

A very useful tool would be a mix of: testbeds and high level models with perturbations = exagerated view of the discrepancies between ideal and real behaviors
