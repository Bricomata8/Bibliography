Introduction to NDN

IP

NDN

Host-centric addressing

Data-centric addressing

Is It Deployed?
• Deployable now as an overlay (TCP, UDP) or on Layer 2 transport
• C, Java, Python, Javascript libraries
• http://github.com/named-data
• Testbed of 15 routers, including 5 on Internet2 / GENI • http://ndnmap.arl.wustl.edu/

Telephone Network was the 1st Communication System
Focus on building and connecting the wires

IP Revolutionized the Communication System
Internet Protocol (RFC791): Focused on delivering packets to destination host

NDN: Focus on Data
Abstracting away the notion of “host” Superset of host-to-host communication model

Two Problems with Current Internet
• Focus is on end-point communication
– Artifact of original thinking: share resources, not content
– Login to fast machine, access to the tape drive, the printer, etc.
• Security
– To get data, you build a secure path – Once you authenticated with the server,
you trust the content

New Communication Paradigm
• Users today care about content, not the servers
• Accessing the server is a by-product of the need to retrieve the desired content
– If the server is down, no access to the content
• But what if the content was available from other places (e.g., my neighbor)?
• We do a lot of this already with HTTP
– URLs, CDNs, caches, etc.

Two Focal Points in NDN
• Focus on the what not the where • Secure the data not the container

NDN Operation
• Interest packets • Data packets • Enhanced Forwarding
– Pending Interest Table (PIT)- new! – Content Store (CS) – new! – Forwarding Information Base (FIB) –
similar to IP

The IPv4 Datagram Format

IP protocol version number
header length (bytes)
“type” of data
max number remaining hops (decremented at
each router)

32 bits

ver

head. len

type of service

length

16-bit identifier flgs

fragment offset

time to upper

live

layer

Internet checksum

32 bit source IP address

upper layer protocol to deliver payload to

32 bit destination IP address Options (if any)

data (variable length, typically a TCP or UDP segment)

total datagram length (bytes)
for fragmentation/ reassembly
E.g. timestamp, record route taken, specify list of routers to visit.

Two Simple Changes

32 bits

Delete the Source. Named Data Networking
does not have sources
Delete the Destination. Named Data Networking
does not have destinations

ver

head. len

type of service

length

16-bit identifier flgs

fragment offset

live

layer

Internet checksum

32 bit source IP address

32 bit destination IP address

Options (if any)

data (variable length)

IPv6 killed these already

NDN Packets

Interest Packet

Data Packet

Content Name: Identifies the data I want to receive
Selector: identifier publisher, etc
Nonce

Content Name: Identifies the data in this packet
NSoingcneature: Required for all packets

Data

For X

n • Interest: Content Name (CN) = X t• Forward interest towards Publisher (X)

e • Mark incoming faces as wanting X (lay down

rbreadcrumbs)
• Merge same interests for X

Summary

• Route on content names • Content from anywhere: not just the producer • “Breadcrumbs” & de-duplication of requests • Cache retrieved data in Content Store (CS)

Example: Delivering Mail

Mail client

Interest: I have mail for you
Interest: Give me your mail
Data: here’s my mail

Mail server

The Power of Naming
• Naming can fetch the data transparently regardless of location
– Requests can go to appropriate place
• Naming can result in generation of new data
– Can ask for data that does not yet exist!

Experiment Topology

NDN and Anonymity
• NDN has no endpoint addresses – names in interests and data packets are ephemerally associated with incoming/outgoing faces
• Info retrievable at a router:
– PIT – interest/data names and associated face information; inmemory, ephemeral (~RTT)
– Content Store – data names, no face information; in-memory, ephemeral (~nRTT)
– Attached storage (repo) – data names, no face information; on non-volatile memory, long-lived
• Individual endpoints, however, engaged in a private conversation can still be identified by their names
29

In NDN Vantage Point Matters

Vantage

Point C

Vantage ? /nytimes.com/today

Point D

Vantage

Regional ISP A

AT&T

Point E

Vantage Point B

Regional ISP B

Vantage Point A

• Information aggregation increases and user targeting decreases going from vantage points A – E
• In IP it’s the opposite
30

Recap
• In NDN routers hold ephemeral name-tointerface associations – no e2e associations
• Vantage point matters • Caching may satisfy interests before they
reach your vantage point • Multipath may divert interests away from your
vantage point • But private parties still visible on the wire
31

DDoS Attacks
• Classic DDoS is not possible
– Cannot send packets without interests
• However, can still do Interest packet flooding
– Standard push-back defenses still possible – Smart decisions based on parsing names
• In general, NDN raises the bar

Congestion Control
• Use lessons learned from TCP – mechanisms carry over
– Define congestion window just like TCP – Send interests that fall within the
congestion window – Use similar AIMD behavior
• Note that receiver window is not needed – receiver pulls what it wants

Key Distribution
• No single way to distribute keys
– Key distribution outside the architecture – Certificates, consensus, out-of-band, applications
are free to implement anything that works – Packets tell you how to get the key (or may even
carry the key with them)
• Key delegation
– Example: www.nytimes.com can delegate keys to editors for www.nytimes.com/sports, www.nytimes/com/business, etc.

Conclusions
• NDN preserves the hourglass shape of IP but with names at the narrow waist
• Architecture focused on the what, not the where
• New forwarding mechanisms enable multipath, multicast and other group operations
• All content is signed • More at http://www.named-data.net/
35

BACKUP SLIDES

Naming the Content
• Client requests www.nytimes.com/today • Interests go out for each packet:
– www.nytimes.com/today/packet1 – www.nytimes.com/today/packet2 –…
• Routers forward based on www.nytimes.com prefix (longest prefix match, just like IP)
• Data is pulled and cached one packet at a time • Each packet contains information on how to
retrieve the signing key

Communication by Names

Applications using names
Translation
Delivering packet by IP addresses
• Producer announces data prefix
– e.g., www.nytimes.com/
• Consumer sends interest • Producer replies with data

Applications using names
Delivering packets by
names

Transparency in NDN
With a search warrant for a router, what can you discover about an ISP's users?
• Assumption: warrant covers volatile and non-volatile memory
42

Network Security in IP: why so Hard?

•IP identifies interfaces/hosts
•Current attempts aim at:
•Securing the box •Securing the channel •Securing an IP network by firewall
•Securing the perimeter is hard

Global Internet

My net

43

30 Years Down the Road
IP changed the world

Interconnections of computers
Moore’s Law & silicon revolution

A new world of applications &
computing devices

44

So Why a New Architecture?
• What are the problems with the current Internet?
• Are they worth re-designing the network?
• With the current architecture being so entrenched, can we even deploy a new one?

Evolution of Communication Abstraction

Telephone Network: Focused on building the wires

Internet Protocol (RFC791): Focused on delivering packets to destination node

NDN: Focusing on retrieving data
Abstracting away the notion of “node”

A New Way to Think About Security
• Secure the Content, Not the Channel!
– SSL, VPN, ssh tunnel, ToR, etc all focus on providing a secure channel
– Users don’t really care if the channel is secure, focus on the content
• Require Authentication on All Content
– Security is not an option, its part of architecture
• Encrypt the content if you don’t trust the channel
– Encryption is optional and applied where needed
