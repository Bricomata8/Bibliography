ABSTRACT
Users in social network are confronted with the risk of privacy leakage while sharing information with friends whose privacy protection awareness is poor. This paper proposes a security risk estimation framework of social network privacy, aiming at quantifying privacy leakage probability when information is spread to the friends of target users‚Äô friends. The privacy leakage probability in information spreading paths comprises Individual Privacy Leakage Probability (IPLP) and Relationship Privacy Leakage Probability (RPLP). IPLP is calculated based on individuals‚Äô privacy protection awareness and the trust of protecting others‚Äô privacy, while RPLP is derived from relationship strength estimation. Experiments show that the security risk estimation framework can assist users to find vulnerable friends by calculating the average and the maximum privacy leakage probability in all information spreading paths of target user in social network. Besides, three unfriending strategies are applied to decrease risk of privacy leakage and unfriending the maximum degree friend is optimal.

1. INTRODUCTION
Considering the prevalence and influence of social networking, potential security risk of privacy problems when sharing personal information in social network stemmed from social network have become increasingly grievous and thought-provoking[1].So quantifying the privacy leakage risk is significant and meaningful for each user in social network.
Accordingly, some articles composed to reveal the potential threat and vulnerability in online social network [2]. Measuring

individuals‚Äô vulnerability according to their friends‚Äô privacy settings and their network is proposed in [3] [4]. Vulnerability index was proposed to measure how vulnerable online social network (OSN) users are [5]. In [6], the author introduces TAPE framework to estimate privacy risk of social network based on the similarity between the reliability analysis in wireless sensor networks and the privacy risk estimation in online social network. Despite defining and analyzing privacy risk partly, these articles didn‚Äôt consider the effect of human behaviors on privacy leakage, meanwhile individual‚Äôs privacy leakage risk is influenced by relationship in online social network.
This manuscript proposes a security risk estimation framework of social networking privacy to calculate probability of individual privacy leakage through social graph. The framework composes of two parts, which are the calculation of Individual Privacy Leakage Probability and the Relationship Privacy Leakage Probability which considers the factors of relationship strength and interactive behaviors. Individual Privacy Leakage Probability is regarded as the probability user would gossip others‚Äô privacy in his/her moments, while the user has heard and been attracted by others‚Äô personal information, calculated from vectors, privacy protection awareness(PPA) and privacy protection trust (PPT). Relationship Privacy Leakage Probability depends on relationship strength estimation, under the premise of the stronger relationship strength can reveal more privacy information to each other. On the basis of [7], IPLP is quantified, furthermore, relationship strength estimation algorithm proposed is applied to estimate RPLP.
2. RELATED WORK
2.1 Definition of privacy leakage risk
In online social network, when the individual‚Äô private information of person P is divulged from his/her friend FP to another one FFP (FFP is not P‚Äôs friend), then it is called privacy leakage, shown as Figure 1.

2.2 Individual Privacy Leakage Probability
Individual Privacy Leakage Probability(IPLP) describes the probability that a user divulge his/her friends‚Äô privacy based on his/her subjective consciousness. Inspired by [7], two vectors,

81

namely privacy protection awareness(PPA) and privacy protection trust(PPT) are proposed in this paper to estimate IPLP.

2.2.1 PPA

PPA is denoted as the privacy caring level of a user. It depends

on the user‚Äôs privacy settings {

} where is

the user and is the privacy setting in item of user profile .

Usually, in a social network, privacy setting has options {public,

friends of friends, friends, self}, corresponding to value {1,2,3,4}.

Then, individual privacy protection awareness IPPA is calculated

as following:

(

)

(1)

Where

represents the proportion of users whose privacy

setting is looser than that of user , in contrary,

represents the proportion of users with tighter privacy setting

than user .

Calculating the IPPA for all types of information, the PPA of is calculated as following:

‚àë

(2)

2.2.2 PPT
Privacy protection trust (PPT)is applied to evaluate how much a user should be trusted by others in protecting privacy. This indicator is acquired based on the synthesize evaluation of friends. The trust evaluation levels of friend to a user is . has
options {never, hardly, neutral, pretty, very} corresponding to value {0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1}. Considering the evaluation of friends with high PPA is more reliable, PPT can be estimate as following:

() ‚àë

(3)

Where represents evaluated by friends whose PPA is

higher than the given threshold e. When there doesn‚Äôt exist high

PPA (

)friends,the user‚Äôs PPT is evaluated by top3 PPA

friends without high PPA (

) friend, otherwise it is set as

0.1 with less than 3 friends.

2.2.3 Estimation of IPLP
IPLP is resulted from PPA and PPT. Personal privacy disclosure is related to the degree of self-protection and the trustworthiness of the surrounding friends. PPA reflects the degree of privacy protection , and PPT refers to the trust whose friends contribute to him/her. But specific algorithms can‚Äôt be raised to determine the importance between them according to the known information. So the estimation of IPLP is

Where w is a weight factor between 0 and 1.In the experiments, it is set as 0.5.

2.3 Relationship Privacy Leakage Probability
RPLP describes the probability of privacy leakage based on the relationship of friends. Typically, individuals tend to reveal more private information to friend online with stronger relationship strength. RPLP is quantified by estimation of relationship strength.

2.3.1 Estimation of Relationship Strength
This article postulates a probabilistic model according to similarity of users‚Äô profiles, degree of interaction, similarity of interest to measure relationship strength.

2.3.1.1 Similarity of User Profile
The homophily principle manifests that people are inclined to form ties with other people who have similar characteristics [8].

*

+ represents the similarity of user profile

between user and .There exists a positive correlation between

relationship strength and user profiles similarity .Here, M stands for the number of attributes in the profile. If user and

share the identical value at K-th item, then

2.3.1.2 Degree of Interaction
Relationship strength can contribute to distinct interaction,
such as like, comment and forward, impacting degree of interaction, denoted as .There exists stronger relationship
strength between different users with more interactive behaviors. The degree of interaction depends on two factors. Firstly, the count of comments, forwards and likes between users is pivotal, which is specified as Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±°(Ì†µÌ±ñ ) . The other is standard deviation of interactive frequency within a specific time interval
,denoted as Ì†µÌ∞π Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±û Ì†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±¶(Ì†µÌ±ñ ). This article holds that three times a week within a month leads to stronger relationship strength than twelve times in a week in the premise of interaction behaviors up to twelve times a month. reflects the strength of interactive
behaviors, which is calculated as following:

Ì†µÌºÜ Ì†µÌ∞∂Ì†µÌ±úÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±öÌ†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±°(Ì†µÌ±ñ ) Ì†µÌºÜ Ì†µÌ∞π Ì†µÌ±íÌ†µÌ±û Ì†µÌ±í Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±¶(Ì†µÌ±ñ )

2.3.1.3 Similarity of Interest

Similarity of interest between the user and ,denoted as

Ì†µÌ∞∂ ,is depicted by judging whether the friends have common

posts in some information domains such as work, learning, travel,

diet, sports, etc. Information domain vector is described as

The interactive behaviors strength depends on the relationship strength and similarity of interest. The dependency among , and Ì†µÌ∞∂ is modeled as following [3]:

4. EXPERIMENTS
4.1 Data Collection
Dataset of 46 Facebook users‚Äô privacy settings is obtained by questionnaire. The users‚Äô profiles items and interactive documents in one month are downloaded from Facebook website. The items of user privacy settings include gender, birth date, phone number, education, current city, hometown, life events, professional skill, college. Friendship between 46 users is shown as Figure 4.
4.2 Experiments and Results
4.2.1 Experiment 1
In this experiment, the IPLP of 46 users is shown as Figure 5. The user with the higher IPLP more likely divulges the privacy of friends online. From Figure 5, the result that users numbered 44 and 45 are more vulnerable in divulging others‚Äô privacy is obtained, attributed to the number of friends belonged to target users and various evaluation of numerous friends with high PPA.

Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG)[10] is applied

to estimate the relationship strength calculation model, which

depicts the relevance between users and the returned relationship

strength. All the users are required to score the relationship

strength of their friends with one from the collection

*

+. When the difference between each side of friends

is more than 0.2, these two users is requested to re-score the

relationship strength. On a scale of 1-4, 1 represents terrible, 2

83

represents bad, 3 represents fair, and 4 represents good. Top50

strength values are selected to calculate the nDCG. For optimizing

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In online social network, privacy leakage may remain all the time while personal information is shared by interaction with friends. This manuscript proposes a security risk estimation framework of privacy issue in online social network by quantifying the

84

probability of privacy leakage in each disseminating path of information. Besides, three unfriending strategies in real dataset of Facebook are conducted to decrease the rate of privacy leakage in online social network. In the future, a large-scale social networking should be established with more complicated relationship to guarantee a more reliable privacy security analysis of social networking.
