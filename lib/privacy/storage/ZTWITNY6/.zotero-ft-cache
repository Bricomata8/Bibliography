Introduction

How does a network evolve?

Analysis & Results

Networks are a collection of interconnected entities whose ties to one another are maintained by actively interacting. Examples include ﬁnancial deals between companies and groups of people sharing a common relation such as friendship or occupation.
Many of us are part of a network. Indeed, some will be part of more than one. Others will leave networks and join new ones. In doing so people decide about who and what they associate with - they are actors choosing to make ties with other actors.
Using longitudinal data [OECD] on the migration of people between 13 EU countries between 2000-2009 a set of parameters each describing how a speciﬁc aspect of the network evolves may be estimated.

Diﬀerent actors in a network will observe diﬀerent changes over the same time interval. Consequently one actor is chosen deterministically or at random to play the role of the ego; the focal point about which network change is observed.
At an observed time an actor may choose to change one outgoing tie or do nothing. These choices have probabilities determined by the objective function, fi(β, χ). This is a function of the current network, χ, as seen by the ego:

fi(β, χ) = βkski(χ)

(1)

k

ski(χ) are functions of the network as viewed by

actor-i known as eﬀects. The βk terms are the

associated weight parameters representing the

tendency of an actor towards (βk > 0) or away

(βk < 0) from that eﬀect.

Due to the ad-hoc nature of the model RSiena returns p-values for each eﬀect, p-values vary between zero to one. For p < 0.001 the eﬀect is signiﬁcant and should be included in the model and hence the objective function. For p 0.001 the eﬀect should be excluded from the model. For p ∈ [0.1, 0.3] the eﬀect may be of some signiﬁcance to the model.
The data exhibits a good density of ties between actors over the ten year period. (avg. of 3.443 degrees per country)

How can a network be constructed?
For a given point in time, tk, a network of n actors and the ties between them may be represented by a n × n matrix; Ak.
Ties in a network are directional, known as out-degrees or in-degrees they are initiated by one actor onto another. The matrix elements; aij of Ak reﬂect this:

For a tie from actor-i to actor-j: aij = 1. (out-degree of i/in-degree of j)
For a non-tie from actor-i to actor-j: aij = 0. However a tie from actor-j to actor-i may still exist (aji = 1). If both aij = aji = 1 the tie is reciprocal. aii = 0, ∀ i ∈ [1, n], Z.

As an example, consider a network of 4 actors:

 a11 a12 a13 a14   0 1 0 0 

Ak

Each row of Ak represents an actor and the ties (if any) it shares with other actors in the network as seen below.

If actor-i has the opportunity to make a tie between themselves and one of two other actors, diﬀerent outcomes of the network can occur, χa or χb. fi(β, χb) − fi(β, χa) is the log odds ratio for choosing between these two outcomes, the ratio of probability between χa and χb is then:

exp(fi (β ,

χb)

−

fi (β ,

χa))

=

exp(fi (β , exp(fi (β ,

χb)) χa))

Eﬀects

Eﬀects are observed patterns in network change. The choice of which eﬀects to include in a model (and hence which values of βk) is completely ad-hoc and is down to study interest and subject area. The eﬀects chosen for this study are:
indegree - popularity : tendency for actors with high in-degrees to attract more in-degrees.
outdegree - activity : tendency for actors with high out-degrees to send out further out-degrees.
out-in degree assortativity : tendency for actors with high out-degrees to preferably tie themselves to actors with high in-degrees. [R.M. Ripley et al., 2011 ]

Range of ties 2000-2009: (min, max) = (40,55) = 15

Figure 4: Table of values for eﬀects and associated βk values

The p-values shown in ﬁg.4 suggest that none of the three studied eﬀects are pivotal in inﬂuencing migration. However, an observed p-value of 0.2993 on the outdegree-activity eﬀect suggests that the rate at which people leave a country has a stronger bearing in inﬂuencing migration than the popularity of the countries they migrate to:- the indegree popularity eﬀect (p-value = 0.5619).

Conclusion

Study: EU Migration
Data on the migration of people between 13 EU countries from 2000-2009 was collected (CZ, DK, FI, FR, DE, IE, NL, PO, PT, SK, SE, ES, UK) ⇒ ten 13x13 matrices.
Dyadic covariates (number of people) and constant actor covariates (average wage) were added to each tie and actor (≡country) in the network respectively.
Eﬀects were included using the R package, RSiena. RSiena estimates values of βk for each eﬀect using a stochastic approximation algorithm.

All data was collected between the years 2000-2009. The data exhibits a good density of ties between actors. Too few changes between time intervals to observe signiﬁcant eﬀects. Inﬂuence of eﬀects can only be inferred.
Improvements to the study would include: Data sets representing networks of actors that regularly make/break ties. RSiena is under constant development with eﬀects regularly being added. Future eﬀects may better describe migration with more accuracy.
