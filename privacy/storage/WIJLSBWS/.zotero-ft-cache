Abstract— This paper studies the opinion dynamics that

result when individuals consecutively discuss a sequence of

issues. Speciﬁcally, we study how individuals’ self-conﬁdence

levels evolve via a reﬂected appraisal mechanism. Motivated by

the DeGroot-Friedkin model, we propose a Modiﬁed DeGroot-

Friedkin model which allows individuals to update their self-

conﬁdence levels by only interacting with their neighbors and

in particular, the modiﬁed model allows the update of self-

conﬁdence levels to take place in ﬁnite time without waiting

for the opinion process to reach a consensus on any particular

issue. We study properties of this Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin

model and compare the associated equilibria and stability with

those of the original DeGroot-Friedkin model. Speciﬁcally, for

the case when the interaction matrix is doubly stochastic, we

show that for the modiﬁed model, the vector of individuals’ self-

conﬁdence levels converges to a unique nontrivial equilibrium

I. INTRODUCTION
Over the years, the advancement in information technology has enabled individuals to be more closely connected and the rapid expansion of online social networks has provided huge amount of data available for analysis regarding how individuals interact over networks. Consequently, much research attention has been drawn to understand how an individual’s opinion evolves over time, in particular, how to model the underlying process of opinion formation [1], [2], [3]. There has been increasing interest in developing models of opinion dynamics to capture individuals’ interaction, and some of these as relevant to the topic of this paper will be mentioned later. In the literature, two main approaches have been adopted on how each individual updates her opinion: probabilistic [4], [5] and deterministic [1], [2], [3].
In social sciences, quite a few models have been proposed for opinion dynamics. Notable among them are the three classical models, namely, the DeGroot model [1], the Friedkin-Johnsen model [2], and the Krause model [3]. In the DeGroot model, each individual has a ﬁxed set of neighbors and the local interaction is captured by taking the convex combination of her own opinion and the opinions of her neighbors at each time step. The model can be extended naturally to the case in which the neighbor sets change over time. The Friedkin-Johnsen model is a variation of the DeGroot model in which each individual is assumed to adhere to her initial opinion to a certain degree, which brings

in some level of stubbornness. The Krause model deﬁnes the neighbor sets in a different way. Each individual takes those individuals whose opinions differ from her by no more than a certain conﬁdence level as her neighbors. It turns out that the Krause model is nonlinear, while the ﬁrst two models lead to linear opinion updates.
Some recent works have extended the classical models to include more variations. For example, the presence of stubborn individuals has received increasing attention [4], [5], [6]. In [4] and [5], the effects of stubborn individuals who never update their opinions are investigated in a randomized gossiping process. In [6], the opinion formation process is regarded as a local interaction game and the concept of the stubbornness of an individual regarding her initial opinion is introduced. Other works have extended the Krause model [7] or utilized the idea of conﬁdence level [8], [9], [10]. The work of [7] introduces and studies a variation of the Krause model, which involves a continuum of agents. In contrast with the Krause model, the neighbors of an individual in [8] are deﬁned to be those individuals whose inﬂuence range contains this individual. The works of [9], [10] bring exogenous factors, such as the inﬂuence of media, into the model and each individual updates her opinion via the opinions of the population inside the individual’s conﬁdence range and the information from an exogenous input in that range.
A particularly interesting recent work, which motivates this paper, is the DeGroot-Friedkin model proposed by Jia et al. [11], [12]. The DeGroot-Friedkin model in [11], [12] contains two stages and studies the evolution of self-conﬁdence, i.e., how conﬁdent an individual is for her opinions on a sequence of issues. In the ﬁrst stage, individuals update their opinions for a particular issue according to the classical DeGroot model, and in the second stage, the self-conﬁdence for the next issue is governed by the reﬂected appraisal mechanism studied in [13], [14]. Reﬂected appraisal mechanism, in simple words, describes the phenomenon that individuals’ self-appraisals on some dimension (e.g., selfconﬁdence, self-esteem) are inﬂuenced by the appraisals of other individuals on them. An extended DeGroot-Friedkin model which includes stubborn individuals has been investigated in [15].
Motivated by the original model, we propose a Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model in this paper. For the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model, we implement the ideas in the original DeGroot-Friedkin model in a distributed way to consider the situation when the process of self-conﬁdence updates takes place within ﬁnite time steps for each issue. When the updates take place after inﬁnite time steps, i.e.,

after the estimated values converge, the original model is

exactly recovered (see Section III for details). Speciﬁcally,

this paper studies the case when self-conﬁdence is updated

after every discussion of an issue. A complete study for

the modiﬁed model when the interaction matrix is doubly

stochastic is provided. We show that the self-conﬁdence

vector asymptotically converges to the equal-weights vector

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section II,

we review the original DeGroot-Friedkin model, and then in

Section III, we discuss some motivations and introduce the

Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model. In Section IV, we present

the equilibria and stability analysis for the modiﬁed model

in terms of the doubly stochastic interaction matrix. Finally,

we conclude and discuss some future directions in Section

VI.

Notation. All vectors are assumed to be column vectors.

For any positive integer n, we use [n] to denote the set

{1, 2, . . . , n}. For any two sets A and B, we use A \ B =

{x|x ∈ A, x ∈/ B} to denote the set difference. We use x

to denote the transpose of a vector, and A to denote the

transpose of a matrix. We deﬁne 1 to be the vector with all entries equal to one in Euclidean space Rn. We use ei to
denote the vector with 1 in the ith entry and 0 for all other entries. For any two real vectors x, y ∈ Rn, we use x ≥ y to

denote xi ≥ yi, for all i ∈ [n], and x > y to denote xi > yi, for all i ∈ [n]. In addition, I denotes the n ×n identity matrix. For

a vector x, we use diag(x) to represent the diagonal matrix

with the ith diagonal entry being xi. A stochastic matrix A is
a nonnegative matrix with row sum equal to 1, i.e., ai j ≥ 0 for all i and j ∈ [n], and ∑nj=1 ai j = 1, for all i ∈ [n]. A left stochastic matrix is a nonnegative matrix with column sum equal to 1, i.e., ai j ≥ 0 for all i and j ∈ [n], and ∑ni=1 ai j = 1, for all j ∈ [n]. A matrix is doubly stochastic if it is both

stochastic and left stochastic. Finally, we use ∆ to denote the n-simplex, i.e., ∆ = {x ∈ Rn|x ≥ 0, 1 x = 1}.

II. THE DEGROOT-FRIEDKIN MODEL
A. Opinion dynamics for a single issue
We consider a social network with n > 1 individuals labeled from 1 to n. Each individual i is able to communicate with certain other individuals called individual i’s neighbors. Neighbor relations are described by a directed graph G. We will call G the neighbor graph, in which nodes correspond to individuals and directed edges represent the neighbor relations, i.e., j is a neighbor of i if (i, j) is a directed edge. Consider the case when n individuals are discussing a sequence of issues in the network; let us label each issue as {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . } with the understanding that issue s + 1 will be discussed right after issue s. For a ﬁxed issue s ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }, we denote the ith individual’s opinion for issue s at time t to be yi(s,t) ∈ R. For each issue s, the update of yi(s,t) is determined by the DeGroot model
n
yi(s,t + 1) = wii(s)yi(s,t) + ∑ wi j(s)y j(s,t), (1)
j=1, j=i

or in matrix form

y(s,t + 1) = W (s)y(s,t)

(2)

where W (s) is called the inﬂuence matrix and assumed to be stochastic. From (1), the opinion of individual i at time t + 1 is a convex combination of all the individuals’ opinions at the previous time t. We deﬁne wii(s) to be the self-conﬁdence of ith individual, i.e., to what extent the ith individual adheres to his opinion on issue s at previous time or how conﬁdent the ith individual is for his opinion on issue s at previous time. Correspondingly, off-diagonal entry wi j(s) determines to what extent, the ith individual’s opinion will be affected by others.
The work of [11], [12] studied the evolution of selfconﬁdence wii(s) for a sequence of issues. For simplicity, let xi(s) = wii(s), and we call the vector x(s) as the selfconﬁdence vector for issue s. Since W (s) is assumed to be stochastic, 1 − xi(s) is then the total weight that individual i assigns to her neighbors. The DeGroot-Friedkin model in [11], [12] decomposes wi j(s) as

wi j(s) = (1 − xi(s))ci j

(3)

Let C = [ci j] be the matrix with entries equal to ci j. Matrix C is compliant with the neighbor graph G, and G is assumed to be strongly connected with no self-loops and ﬁxed across issues. So, cii = 0 and C is irreducible. Since W (s) is assumed to be stochastic, from the decomposition (3), one can see that the matrix C will be stochastic. We will call C the relative interaction matrix and ci j is correspondingly the relative interpersonal weight that the ith individual assigns to her neighbors.
In summary, the ﬁnal dynamics for a single issue s is
n
yi(s,t + 1) = xi(s)yi(s,t) + ∑ (1 − xi(s))ci jy j(s,t),
j=1, j=i
or in matrix form

y(s,t + 1) = W (x(s))y(s,t)

(4)

where W (x(s)) = diag(x(s)) + (I − diag(x(s)))C.

B. Evolution of self-conﬁdence across a sequence of issues

We use u(x(s)) to denote the normalized (i.e., 1 u(x(s)) = 1) left eigenvector of the inﬂuence matrix W (x(s)) associated with the eigenvalue 1. From Perron-Frobenius theorem, u(x(s)) > 0 and is unique. We will call u(x(s)) the dominant left eigenvector.
It is well known that for the DeGroot model, the limit of the opinions for each issue s is:

lim y(s,t) = lim W (x(s))t y(s, 0) = u(x(s)) y(s, 0)1 (5)

t→∞

t→∞

Therefore, the individuals’ opinions for issue s converge to a convex combination of their initial opinions on issue s and the coefﬁcients u(x(s)) describe how much each individual

contributes to the ﬁnal opinions. In other words, ui(x(s)) can be regarded as the social power for individual i in

determining the ﬁnal outcomes for a particular issue s.

For a sequence of issues s ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }, the reﬂected appraisal mechanism introduced in [13] is to let xi(s + 1) = ui(x(s)). The underlying rationale is that as described in the introduction, the reﬂected appraisal mechanism captures the property that individuals’ self-appraisals on some dimension (in this case, the self-conﬁdence for issue s + 1) are affected by the appraisals of other individuals on them. Note that ui(x(s)) represents the social power of individual i in determining the outcomes of issue s. If individual i has larger social power, it is very likely that he will be more conﬁdent on his own opinion when discussing the next issue s + 1. Note that for issue s ≥ 1, the self-conﬁdence vector x(s) necessarily takes value inside ∆ from the update, so it is assumed in [11], [12] that the self-conﬁdence vector is in ∆ for all issues s ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }.
Finally, the DeGroot-Friedkin model is

x(s + 1) = u(x(s))

(6)

where u(x(s)) ∈ ∆ and is the dominant left eigenvector of the inﬂuence matrix

W (x(s)) = diag(x(s)) + (I − diag(x(s)))C

(7)

The interaction matrix C is assumed to be stochastic and

irreducible with diagonal entries being zero.

Theorem 1: [11, Theorem 4.1] Suppose that n ≥ 3 and all

n individuals adhere to the DeGroot-Friedkin model deﬁned

by (6) and (7). Suppose that the underlying neighbor graph

G is not a star1. Then, the following statements are true:

(1). (Equilibria) The set of ﬁxed points for x(s + 1) = u(x(s)) is {e1, ..., en, x∗}, where x∗ lies in the interior of the simplex

∆.

(2). (Stability) For all initial conditions x(0) ∈ ∆\{e1, ..., en}, the self-conﬁdence x(s) converges to the equilibrium conﬁg-

uration x∗ as s → ∞.

stochastic,

III. MODIFIED DEGROOT-FRIEDKIN MODEL

As noted in the above section, the process of reﬂected appraisal for x(s+1) (i.e., (6)) takes place only after opinions y(s,t) of issue s converges as suggested in (5), which takes many or inﬁnite number of discussions (i.e., time steps). One may be able to know the self-conﬁdence level for the next issue without waiting that long if she can compute the dominant left eigenvector u(x(s)). However, u(x(s)) requires global information about the network that is usually impossible and for large networks, a distributed update is often more preferable.
In order to answer the above questions, we ﬁrst look at a distributed update scheme for self-conﬁdence vector which was proposed in [11]. Assume that for each individual, she estimates her social power ui(x(s)) for issue s along the time of discussions, and let us denote the perceived social

power for issue s at time t as pi(s,t). Further, assume that the ith individual knows the exact interpersonal weight her neighbors assign to her, i.e., w ji(s) for all j in the neighbors of i. Then, every individual updates her perceived selfconﬁdence pi(s,t) for issue s according to
n
pi(s,t + 1) = wii(s)pi(s,t) + ∑ w ji(s)p j(s,t) (8)
j=1, j=i

which in matrix form is p(s,t + 1) = W (s) p(s,t). We know that limt→∞ p(s,t) = u(x(s)) for all initial states p(s, 0) such that 1 p(s, 0) = 1.
However, in order to update x(s + 1), we still need to wait for a sufﬁciently long time for the perceived self-conﬁdence p(s,t) to converge. In order to simultaneously achieve a distributed and ﬁnite time update for the self-conﬁdence levels, in this paper, we propose the following model, which is based on the distributed update (8).
Recall that xi(s) = wii(s), w ji(s) = (1 − x j(s))c ji and C is stochastic with diagonal entries being zero. Then, (8) is equivalent to
n
pi(s,t + 1) = xi(s)pi(s,t) + ∑ (1 − x j(s))c ji p j(s,t) (9) j=1
Since we want to update x(s + 1) in ﬁnite time steps instead of waiting for the update of opinions y(s,t) to converge, a straightforward modiﬁcation is that we update x(s + 1) in ﬁnite time steps according to (9), i.e.,

xi(s + 1) = pi(s, T )

(10)

for some ﬁnite time steps T . This means that for each issue, after T times discussions, individuals will update their selfconﬁdence levels for the next issue based on the discussions. This model reasonably captures the real scenario in that when we are discussing a sequence of issues with others,

we only discuss it for limited times and the opinions need not necessarily converge. Note that if T goes to inﬁnity, the original DeGroot-Friedkin model is exactly recovered. Therefore, in this sense, the above model is a generalization of the original model. In this paper, we focus on the one-step case when T = 1. Then, (9) becomes

n

xi(s + 1) = xi(s)xi(s) + ∑ (1 − x j(s))c jix j(s)

(11)

j=1

From (11), to update self-conﬁdence, one only needs to know the self-conﬁdence levels of her neighbors and the interpersonal weight c ji from her neighbors. We will refer to (11) as the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model. We make the same assumption about the neighbor graph G as in the DeGroot-Friedkin model, namely, the neighbor graph G is strongly connected with no self-loops and ﬁxed over time. Note that we drop the argument t in (11) since we update x(s) in every time step.
In summary, the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model in matrix form is

x(s + 1) = C x(s) + X(s)x(s) −C X(s)x(s) (12)

where X(s) = diag(x(s)) is a diagonal matrix. The relative in-
teraction matrix C is assumed to be irreducible and stochastic
with diagonal entries being zero. Lemma 1: Suppose that all n individuals adhere to the
Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model deﬁned by (12). Suppose
that the interaction matrix C is stochastic and irreducible
with diagonal entries being zero. Then, the sum of selfconﬁdence levels is constant, i.e., ∑ni=1 xi(s) = ∑ni=1 xi(0), for all s ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . }.
Proof: Multiply both sides of (12) from the left by 1 . Then, the left hand side is 1 x(s + 1) = ∑ni=1 xi(s + 1). Recall that C is stochastic, so 1 C = 1 . Then, the right hand side
is

1 C x(s) + 1 X(s)x(s) − 1 C X(s)x(s)

Therefore, ∑ni=1 xi(s + 1) = ∑ni=1 xi(s) = ∑ni=1 xi(0). Remark: We will make the same assumption on the

initial conditions as in the original DeGroot-Friedkin model,

namely, x(0) ∈ ∆. One reason for doing this is that from

(11), we can see if xi(s) ∈ [0, 1], one can ensure that xi(s + 1) is positive since the square term xi(s)2 ≤ xi(s). Further, by assuming x(0) ∈ ∆, Lemma 1 ensures that ∑ni=1 xi(s) = 1, for all s ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . }, so that xi(s) will always be bounded
in [0, 1]. If we instead assume xi(0) ∈ [0, 1], for all i ∈ [n],
but place no condition on the sum, then xi(s) will not
always be in [0, 1] for future updates, and xi(s) may be
unbounded eventually. Simulation results also conﬁrm the

unboundedness property. A future direction of research is

to relax this assumption, because while it is reasonable to

assume that the self-conﬁdence levels are within [0, 1], it is

less reasonable that the self-conﬁdence levels should sum up

to 1, especially in large social networks.

Lemma 2: For all i ∈ [n], ei is an equilibrium of the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model deﬁned by (12).

Proof: Substituting x(s) = ei into (12), it is straightforward to see that the right hand side is C ei + diag(ei)ei − C diag(ei)ei = ei.
Now, we show some properties regarding the Modiﬁed

DeGroot-Friedkin model which will be used in proving other

results later.

Lemma 3: Suppose that n ≥ 3 and all n individuals adhere

to the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model deﬁned by (12).

Suppose that the relative interaction matrix C is stochastic

and irreducible with diagonal entries being zero. If x(0) ∈

∆n \ {e1, ..., en}, then the following properties hold: (i) If x(0) > 0, then x(s) > 0, for all s ≥ 1.

(ii) If x(s) > 0, then matrix T (s) = C + X(s) − C X(s) is

irreducible.

(iii) Let m be the number of zero entires in x(0). If x(0) ≥ 0,

then after ﬁnite steps τ ≤ m, x(τ) > 0.

Proof: (i) The dynamics (12) can be written as:

x(s + 1) = C (I − X(s))x(s) + X(s)x(s)

If x(0) > 0, then the vector X(0)x(0) = (x12(0), . . . , xn2(0)) > 0. In addition, (I − X(0)) is a diagonal matrix with positive

diagonal entries when x(0) > 0. Since C is a nonnegative matrix, C (I − X(0))x(0) ≥ 0. Therefore, we conclude that x(1) = C (I − X(0))x(0) + X(0)x(0) > 0. Applying the same argument repeatedly, we conclude that x(s) > 0, for all s ≥ 1.
(ii) Since C is assumed to be irreducible, C is also irreducible. T (s) = C + X(s) −C X(s) = C (I − X(s)) + X(s). If x(s) > 0, then (I − X(s)) is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries. When nonnegative matrix C is multiplied by a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries, if ci j = 0, then (C (I −X(s)))i j = 0; if ci j > 0, then (C (I −X(s)))i j > 0. The structure of C does not change, so C (I − X(s)) is also irreducible with diagonal entries being zero. It is well known that a matrix is irreducible if and only if the underlying directed graph represented by the matrix is strongly connected. Strong connectedness means that starting from any node, one can ﬁnd a directed path to any other node in the graph. Therefore, C (I − X(s)) + X(s) only adds self-loops in the underlying directed graph represented by C (I − X(s)), which will not affect the connectivity. So, we conclude that T (s) is irreducible.
(iii) The dynamics (12) can be written as:
x(s + 1) = C (I − X(s))x(s) + X(s)x(s) (13)
= Pb(s) + a(s)
where for simplicity, we use P = C , vector a(s) = (x12(s), . . . , xn2(s)) , and vector b(s) = ((1 − x1(s))x1(s), . . . , (1 − xn(s))xn(s)) . So, P is irreducible. Suppose that the number of zero entries in x(0) is m, without loss of generality, let us assume xi(0) = 0, for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}, and xi(0) > 0 for i ∈ {m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n}.
We ﬁrst claim that the number of zero entries can not increase after one update, that is, the number of zero entries in x(1) is at most m. From the structures of a(s) and b(s), we see that ai(0) = 0, bi(0) = 0 for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} and ai(0) > 0, bi(0) > 0 for i ∈ {m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n}. Since P is a nonnegative matrix, from (13), we see that necessarily, xi(1) > 0 for all i ∈ {m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n}, so the number of zero entries in x(1) is at most m.
We then prove by contradiction that the number of zero entries must decrease. We ﬁrst note that P is irreducible so that the underlying directed graph represented by P is strongly connected. We use the convention that if pi j > 0, then there is a directed edge from node i to node j. Now, suppose that the number of zero entries in x(1) is still m, then necessarily, xi(1) = 0 for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}. From the dynamics (13), this is possible if and only if
pi j = 0, for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m} and j ∈ {m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n} (14)
Transforming the condition (14) into the underlying directed graph of P, it means that we can divide the n nodes into two components. Component 1 contains nodes {1, 2, . . . , m} and component 2 contains nodes {m + 1, m + 2, . . . , n}. Further, there are no directed edges from component 1 to component 2. This is contradicted by the assumption that P is irreducible. So, the number of zero entries in x(1) must decrease.
Finally, since the number of zero entries decreases in x(1),

assume now that there are k < m zero entries in x(1) and
let Z0 = {i|xi(1) = 0, 0 ≤ i ≤ n} and Z1 = {i|xi(1) > 0, 0 ≤ i ≤ n}. Then, |Z0| = k and |Z1| = n − k, where |.| denotes cardinality. Applying the same reasoning, xi(2) > 0 for i ∈ Z1. Again from the dynamics (13), the number of zero entries in x(2) is k if and only if

pi j = 0, for all i ∈ Z0 and j ∈ Z1

which as before contradicts the assumption that P is irreducible if we divide the nodes into two components with one component containing nodes i ∈ Z0 and one component containing nodes j ∈ Z1. So, the number of zero entries in x(2) must decrease. Continuing the same reasoning, we conclude that for each update the number of zero entries in x(s) must strictly decrease. Since the number of zero entries in x(0) is m, after at most m steps, all the entries of x(s) will become positive.

IV. EQUILIBRIA AND STABILITY FOR THE CASE OF DOUBLY STOCHASTIC C

In this section, we will further explore equilibria and

stability properties for the case when the relative interaction

matrix C is doubly stochastic and we will compare our results

with the original DeGroot-Fredkin model

We ﬁrst state the following Perron-Frobenius theorem for

irreducible Metzler matrices, which is used for proving the

next theorem. A Metzler matrix is a matrix whose off-

diagonal entries are all nonnegative. Lemma 4: [16, Theorem 17] Let M ∈ Rn×n be an irre-

ducible Metzler matrix and σ (M) be the set of eigenvalues.

Then,

(i) µ(M) = maxλ∈σ(M) Re(λ ) is an algebraically simple eigenvalue of M.

(ii) Let vF be such that MvF = µ(M)vF . Then, vF is unique (up to scalar multiple) and vF > 0. (iii) If v ≥ 0 but v = 0 is an eigenvector of M, then Mv =

µ(M)v, and hence, v is a scalar multiple of vF .

The equilibria of the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model

are characterized in the following theorem.

Theorem 2: (Equilibria) Suppose that n ≥ 3 and all n

individuals adhere to the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model

deﬁned by (12). Suppose that the relative interaction matrix C

Note that the ith entry of vector x∗ − X∗x∗ is (x∗ − X∗x∗)i = xi∗ − (xi∗)2. As discussed before, since the initial condition x(0) ∈ ∆ and from Lemma 1, xi(s) is necessarily always in [0,1]. As a consequence, x∗ − X∗x∗ ≥ 0. To apply (iii) of
Lemma 4, we still need to show that x∗ − X∗x∗ = 0. Suppose
that x∗ −X∗x∗ = 0, which means xi∗ −(xi∗)2 = 0, for all i ∈ [n], then xi∗ = 0 or xi∗ = 1, for all i ∈ [n]. We know ∑ni=1 xi(s) = 1, so x∗ − X∗x∗ = 0 means x∗ ∈ {e1, . . . , en}, which are the

trivial equilibria for the system. Therefore, for a nontrivial equilibrium, x∗ − X∗x∗ ≥ 0 and x∗ − X∗x∗ = 0. Since C −

I is a Metzler matrix and C is assumed to be irreducible,

from (iii) of Lemma 4, we conclude that x∗ − X∗x∗ is unique

up

to

some

scalar

multiple.

We

already

know

that

1 n

is

an

equilibrium of the system; hence

x∗ − X∗x∗ = a

or for each component

xi∗

(xi∗)2

for all i ∈ [n] and for some a > 0

(15)

Here, a > 0 is a result of the fact that xi∗ ∈ [0, 1]. Although we have shown x∗ − X∗x∗ is unique up to some scalar multiple,

(15) is a quadratic equation and a can be an arbitrary positive number. There may be an inﬁnite number of choices for x∗

that satisﬁes (15). Now, we want to show that under the

condition

n
∑i=1

xi∗

=

there

is

only

one

choice.

For

a

such

that

,

the

quadratic

equation

(15) admits two solutions

1+ xi∗1 =

4a(n−1) n2

Note that both solutions are positive.

(i) Consider ﬁrst the case when xi∗ = xi∗2, for all i ∈ [n].

∑n

xi∗ =

4a(n−1) n2

which is equivalent to a = 1. When a = 1, the above

corresponds

to

the

case

when

x∗

=

1.

(ii) Now consider the second case, that is x∗j = x∗j1 for some j and xi∗ = xi∗2, for all i = j, i ∈ [n]. Then, we need

∑n
xi∗ =

n − (n − 2)

1

−

4a(n−1) n2

2

=1

which is the same as

4a(n − 1) n − (n − 2) 1 − n2 = 2

However, a > 0 implies

1−

4a(n−1) n2

<

1,

so

4a(n − 1)

n − (n − 2) 1 − n2 > 2

(16)

and hence this case is not possible.

(iii) Now one can show that for the case when x∗j = x∗j1, xm∗ = xm∗ 1 for some j = m and xi∗ = xi∗2, for all i = j, i = m, and i ∈ [n], we need

4a(n − 1) n − (n − 4) 1 − n2 = 2
which is not possible by (16). Applying the same idea, in general, one can see that when there are k entries of x∗ that are equal to xi∗1 and the remaining n − k entries are equal to xi∗2, we need

4a(n − 1) n − (n − 2k) 1 − n2 = 2

which is impossible for k ≥ 1 by (16).

Therefore, the only choice under the condition ∑ni=1 = 1

is

the

ﬁrst

case,

and

hence

x∗

=

1 n

1

is

the

only

nontrivial

equilibrium.

Remark: The above theorem only considers the case when
n ≥ 3. The case when n = 2 is interesting, and requires a separate treatment. While x1∗ = xi∗1 and x2∗ = xi∗2 is still an equilibrium which corresponds to x∗ = (0.5, 0.5) , actually, for x1∗ = xi∗1 and x2∗ = xi∗2, x1∗ + x2∗ = 1 for any a > 0. Therefore, as long as we choose any a > 0 that makes the quadratic equation (15) have solutions in [0, 1], x∗ = (xi∗1, xi∗2) is always an equilibrium. The system actually has an inﬁnite number
of nontrivial equilibria for the n = 2 case. Since n = 2 is
too small for almost all social networks, we will focus our
attention on cases when n ≥ 3.

Next, we will show that if the initial conditions are not the
trivial equilibria, the self-conﬁdence vector x(s) converges to the unique nontrivial equilibrium x∗.

Theorem 3: (Asymptotically stable) Suppose that n ≥ 3

and all n individuals adhere to the Modiﬁed DeGroot-

Friedkin model deﬁned by (12). Suppose that the relative

interaction matrix C is doubly stochastic and irreducible with

diagonal entries being zero. Then, for any initial condition

x(0) ∈ ∆ \ {e1, . . . , en}, x(s) asymptotically converges to the

unique

nontrivial

equilibrium

x∗

=

1 n

as

s

→

∞.

To prove Theorem 3, we ﬁrst state the following lemma

regarding the non-expansiveness of the minimal and maximal

entries in x(s).

Lemma 5: Suppose that n ≥ 3 and all n individuals adhere to the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model deﬁned by (12). Assume that the relative interaction matrix C is doubly stochastic and irreducible with diagonal entries being zero, and that x(0) ∈ ∆n \ {e1, . . . , en}. Let x(s)min = min0≤i≤n xi(s) and x(s)max = max0≤i≤n xi(s). Then, for every update, x(s)min and x(s)max are not expanding, i.e., x(s + 1)min ≥ x(s)min and x(s + 1)max ≤ x(s)max, for all s ≥ 0.

Proof: First, let us consider the following equation:

yn1ew = y21 + y2 − y22

(17)

s.t. y1 ≥ 0, y2 ≥ 0, y1 + y2 ≤ 1

Then, we have
yn1ew − y2 = y21 − y22 yn1ew − y1 = (y2 − y1) − (y22 − y21)
= (y2 − y1)(1 − y2 − y1)
Therefore, if y1 ≤ y2, we have y1 ≤ yn1ew ≤ y2; if y2 ≤ y1, we have y2 ≤ yn1ew ≤ y1. So for the equation (17), we obtain the following result:

min(y1, y2) ≤ yn1ew ≤ max(y1, y2)

(18)

Now, let us consider the component-wise Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model (11).

n

∑ xi(s + 1) = xi2(s) +

(x j(s) − x2j (s))c ji (19)

j=1, j=i

Note that since the diagonal entries of C are zero, so for the
second term in (19), taking summation from j = 1 to n is
the same as taking summation from j = 1, j = i to n.
Since C is doubly stochastic with diagonal entries being zero, ∑nj=1, j=i c ji = 1. Therefore, ∑nj=1, j=i(x j(s) − x2j (s))c ji is indeed the convex combination of (x j(s) − x2j (s)) for j = i, j ∈ [n]. Hence,

n

∑ z(i)min ≤

(x j(s) − x2j (s))c ji ≤ z(i)max (20)

j=1, j=i

where z(i)min = min j=i,0≤ j≤n(x j(s) − x2j (s)) and z(i)max = max j=i,0≤ j≤n(x j(s) − x2j (s)).
Now, let v(i)min = min j=i,0≤ j≤n x j(s) and v(i)max = max j=i,0≤ j≤n x j(s). v(i)min is the minimal value among all x j(s) excluding xi(s) and correspondingly v(i)max is the
maximal value excluding xi(s).
We claim that there exists x¯i(s) ∈ [v(i)min, v(i)max] such that

n

∑ x¯i(s) − x¯i2(s) =

(x j(s) − x2j (s))c ji

(21)

j=1, j=i

A graphical representation will help understand the claim.
Figures 1 and 2 are the plots of function f (v) = v − v2. Since ∑ni=1 xi = 1, then necessarily v(i)min ≤ 0.5 and v(i)max ≤ 1 − x(i)min. Function f (v) is strictly increasing for [0, 0.5], so z(i)min = v(i)min − v(i)2min.
Case 1. v(i)max < 0.5. In this case, z(i)max = v(i)max − v(i)2max. From (20), ∑nj=1, j=i(x j(s) − x2j (s))c ji must lie in the bold curve of Figure 1, so there must exist x¯i(s) ∈
[v(i)min, v(i)max] such that (21) holds.
Case 2. v(i)max ≥ 0.5. If z(i)max = v(i)max − v(i)2max, we apply the same reasong in Case 1. If z(i)max = v(i)max − v(i)2max,
then there exists xk < v(i)max such that z(i)max = xk(s) − xk2(s). So from (20), there must exist x¯i(s) ∈ [v(i)min, xk(s)] such that (21) holds. Since xk < v(i)max, from Figure 2, ∑nj=1, j=i(x j(s)−x2j (s))c ji must lie in the bold curve of Figure 2. Hence, there exists x¯i(s) ∈ [v(i)min, v(i)max] such that (21)

Fig. 1: Function f (v) = v − v2, for v(i)max < 0.5

Fig. 2: Function f (v) = v − v2, for v(i)max ≥ 0.5

holds. This completes the proof of our claim. Finally, we can write (19) as

xi(s + 1) = xi2(s) + x¯i(s) − x¯i(s)2

(22)

Further,

since

x¯i(s)

<

v(i)max

and

n
∑i=1

xi(s)

=

1,

then

xi(s) +

x¯i(s) ≤ 1 and xi(s) ≥ 0, x¯i(s) ≥ 0. Comparing (22) with (17),

they have the same structures and conditions. Therefore, from

(18), we conclude:

min(xi(s), x¯i(s)) ≤ xi(s + 1) ≤ max(xi(s), x¯i(s))

Since x¯i(s) ∈ [v(i)min, v(i)max], we ﬁnally get

x(s)min ≤ xi(s + 1) ≤ x(s)max

(23)

where x(s)min = min1≤k≤nxk(s) and x(s)max = max1≤k≤nxk(s). For the above proof, it can be seen that i can be arbitrarily chosen. Therefore, we conclude from (23) that

x(s)min ≤ xi(s + 1) ≤ x(s)max for all i ∈ [n] (24)

which is equivalent to

x(s)min ≤ x(s + 1)min and x(s + 1)max ≤ x(s)max

Based on the above lemma, we provide an even stronger

result regarding the evolution of the maximum of x(s).

Lemma 6: Suppose that n ≥ 3 and all n individuals adhere

to the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model deﬁned by (12).

Assume that the relative interaction matrix C is doubly

stochastic and irreducible with diagonal entries being zero.

Let

x(s)max

= max0≤i≤n xi(s).

If

x(s) > 0

and

x(s) =

1 n

1,

then x(s)max must decrease in at most n − 1 updates, i.e.,

x(s + n − 1)max < x(s)max.

Proof: First, let us consider a variation of (17) in the proof of Lemma 5,

yn1ew = y21 + y2 − y22

(25)

s.t. y1 > 0, y2 > 0, , y1 = y2, y1 + y2 < 1

Then, from the same reasoning, we have

min(y1, y2) < yn1ew < max(y1, y2)

(26)

Recall that in the proof of Lemma 5, we have shown

from (21) and (22) that for any i ∈ [n], there exists x¯i(s) ∈ [v(i)min, v(i)max] such that

n

∑ x¯i(s) − x¯i2(s) =

(x j(s) − x2j (s))c ji

(27)

j=1, j=i

and

xi(s + 1) = xi2(s) + x¯i(s) − x¯i(s)2

(28)

Note that by assuming x(s) > 0, we immediately have xi(s) > 0, x¯i(s) > 0, and xi(s) + x¯i(s) < 1. Comparing with (25), we notice that if we can show that for any i ∈ [n], xi(s) = x¯i(s), then we will have the desirable property that the maximum of x(s) is decreasing.
To this end, let us deﬁne two sets ﬁrst. Let M be the set containing the indices of the maximum elements in x(s), i.e.,

M = {i|i ∈ [n], xi(s) = x(s)max},

and let Q be the set containing the indices of all the elements in x(s) such that xi(s) = x¯i(s), i.e.,

Q = {i|i ∈ [n], xi(s) = x¯i(s)}.

We will use |.| to denote the cardinality of a set.
Note that for any i ∈ M, Case 2 in the proof of Lemma 5 (i.e., v(i)max ≥ 0.5) cannot happen. This is because v(i)max ≤ xi(s) for any i ∈ M. From x(s) > 0 and x(s) ∈ ∆, we then have v(i)max < 0.5. Therefore, we only need to consider Case 1 (i.e., v(i)max < 0.5). From Fig. 1, we can then conclude that x¯i(s) is unique because f (v) = v − v2 is a strictly increasing function in the interval (0,0.5). In addition, note that for any i ∈ Q, we have xi(s + 1) = xi(s) and any i ∈/ Q, we have

x(s)min < xi(s + 1) < x(s)max.

Now, to prove Lemma 6, we consider the following scenarios:
Scenario 1: |M| = 1.
In this scenario, there is only one maximum element in x(s). Without loss of generality, let x1(s) = x(s)max. We claim that 1 ∈/ Q. This is because x¯1(s) ∈ [v(1)min, v(1)max] and v(1)max < x1(s). Therefore, we have

x(s)min < x1(s + 1) < x(s)max = x1(s)

For any i ∈ {2, 3, . . . , n}, if i ∈ Q, then xi(s + 1) = xi(s) < x1(s). If i ∈/ Q, then

x(s)min < xi(s + 1) < x(s)max = x1(s)

Therefore, we conclude that x(s + 1)max < x(s)max. Scenario 2: |M| = 2.

In this scenario, there are two maximum elements in x(s). Again, without loss of generality, let x1(s) = x2(s) = x(s)max and we have x1(s) < 0.5 and x2(s) < 0.5. Now, we can identify three cases.
Scenario 2.A: 1 ∈/ Q and 2 ∈/ Q. Following exactly the same analysis in Scenario 1, we conclude that x(s + 1)max < x(s)max. Scenario 2.B: 1 ∈ Q and 2 ∈/ Q. In this case, we have

x(s)min < x2(s + 1) < x(s)max.

Let us recall that:

n

∑ x¯i(s) − x¯i2(s) =

(x j(s) − x2j (s))c ji

(29)

j=1, j=i

We note that v(1)max = x2(s) and f (v) = v − v2 is a strictly increasing function in interval (0,0.5) (Fig. 1). Therefore, 1 ∈ Q implies that c21 = 1 and c j1 = 0 for any j ∈ [n] and j = 2, as C is assumed to be doubly stochastic with zero diagonal elements. From the component-wise Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model (11), we have

x1(s + 1) = x12(s) + x2(s) − x22(s)

(30)

Therefore, we have x1(s + 1) = x1(s), x2(s + 1) < x1(s), and x j(s + 1) < x1(s) for any j ∈ {2, 3, . . . , n}. x1(s + 1) is then the only maximum element in x(s + 1). This then reduces to Scenario 1, and following the same analysis, we have x(s + 2)max < x(s + 1)max = x1(s + 1). Therefore, we ﬁnally conclude that x(s + 2)max < x(s)max. Note that the analysis for 1 ∈/ Q and 2 ∈ Q is exactly the same.
Scenario 2.C: 1 ∈ Q and 2 ∈ Q.
Again, recall that

n

∑ x¯i(s) − x¯i2(s) =

(x j(s) − x2j (s))c ji

j=1, j=i

Based on the analysis in Scenario 2.B, we know that 1 ∈ Q and 2 ∈ Q imply the following:

c21 = 1 and c j1 = 0, for all j ∈ {3, 4, . . . , n} (31) c12 = 1 and ck2 = 0, for all k ∈ {3, 4, . . . , n}
Transforming condition (31) into the underlying directed graph represented by C, it means that there are only one directed edge from node 2 to node 1 and one directed edge from node 1 to node 2, and no other nodes have directed edges to node 1 or node 2. Therefore, starting from any nodes other than node 1 or node 2, we cannot ﬁnd a directed path to reach node 1 or node 2, which violates the condition that the directed graph is strongly connected (i.e., C is an irreducible matrix). We hence conclude that Scenario 2.C cannot happen.
Scenario 3: |M| = 3. In this scenario, there are three maximum elements in x(s). Again, without loss of generality, let x1(s) = x2(s) = x3(s) = x(s)max and we have x(s)max < 0.5. Now, we can similarly identify four cases.
Scenario 3.A: 1 ∈/ Q, 2 ∈/ Q and 3 ∈/ Q. We can prove that x(s + 1)max < x(s)max by the same

reasoning in Scenario 1. Scenario 3.B: 1 ∈ Q, 2 ∈/ Q and 3 ∈/ Q. Similar to Scenario 2.B, we know that
x(s)min < x2(s + 1) < x(s)max
x(s)min < x3(s + 1) < x(s)max
Like in Scenario 2.B, after one update, this scenario reduces to Scenario 1 and hence we have x(s + 2)max < x(s)max. Note that the analysis for either 2 ∈ Q or 3 ∈ Q is the same.
Scenario 3.C: 1 ∈ Q, 2 ∈ Q and 3 ∈/ Q. Not that the analysis for either 1 ∈/ Q or 2 ∈/ Q is the same as the case when 3 ∈/ Q. From (29), and based on a similar analysis in Scenario 2.B, we notice that 1 ∈ Q and 2 ∈ Q implies the following conditions:
c21 ≥ 0, c31 ≥ 0, and c j1 = 0, for all j ∈ {4, 5, . . . , n} (32) c12 ≥ 0, c32 ≥ 0, and ck2 = 0, for all k ∈ {4, 5, . . . , n}
C is doubly stochastic also implies that c21 + c31 = 1 and c12 + c32 = 1. Condition (32) can be further divided into the following three different cases:
Condition 1: c31 = 0 and c32 = 0. Under this situation, condition (32) reduces to condition (31), which violates the fact that C is an irreducible matrix. Hence, this situation does not happen. Condition 2: either c31 = 0 or c32 = 0, but not both. Let us consider c31 = 0, and the analysis for the case when c32 = 0 is exactly the same. Then, we have c21 = 1, c12 > 0 and c32 > 0. From the component-wise Modiﬁed DeGrootFriedkin model (11), we know that
x1(s + 1) = x12(s) + x2(s) − x22(s) x2(s + 1) = x22(s) + (x1(s) − x12(s))c12 + (x3(s) − x32(s))c32
(33)
Note that from (33) and the fact that 1 ∈ Q, 2 ∈ Q and 3 ∈/ Q, we have x1(s + 1) = x2(s + 1) = x(s + 1)max = x(s)max and x3(s + 1) < x(s)max. Since x3(s + 1) has reduced, (33) suggests that after another update, we must have x1(s + 2) = x(s+1)max = x(s)max and x2(s+2) < x(s+1)max. Now, x2(s+ 2) has reduced, and it is straightforward to see from (33) that x1(s + 3) < x(s + 2)max.
In conclusion, under Condition 2, we have x(s + 3)max < x(s)max.
Condition 3: c31 > 0 and c32 > 0. Similar to the analysis in Condition 2, from (11), we have
x1(s + 1) = x12(s) + (x2(s) − x22(s))c21 + (x3(s) − x32(s))c31 x2(s + 1) = x22(s) + (x1(s) − x12(s))c12 + (x3(s) − x32(s))c32
(34)
Then, x1(s+1) = x2(s+1) = x(s+1)max = x(s)max and x3(s+ 1) < x(s)max. Since x3(s + 1) has reduced, (34) suggests that after another update, we must have x1(s + 2) < x(s + 1)max and x2(s + 2) < x(s + 1)max. Hence, we conclude that x(s + 2)max < x(s)max.
Scenario 3.D: 1 ∈ Q, 2 ∈ Q and 3 ∈ Q. Under this scenario, we know that the following condition

must be satisﬁed:

c21 ≥ 0, c31 ≥ 0, and c j1 = 0, for all j ∈ {4, 5, . . . , n} c12 ≥ 0, c32 ≥ 0, and ck2 = 0, for all k ∈ {4, 5, . . . , n} (35) c13 ≥ 0, c23 ≥ 0, and cl2 = 0, for all l ∈ {4, 5, . . . , n}

Again, transforming condition (35) into the underlying

directed graph represented by C, it means that we can

divide the nodes into two components with component #1

containing nodes {1, 2, 3} and component #2 containing

nodes {4, 5, . . . , n}, and further there are no directed edges

from component #2 to component #1. This violates the

irreducibility assumption of matrix C, and hence this case

does not happen.

Scenario 4: 4 ≤ |M| ≤ n − 1.

The analysis in Scenario 3 can be readily applied in this

scenario with minor modiﬁcations. The difference is that

we will have more tedious cases to discuss. The worst case

happens in a similar situation as Scenario 3.C (Condition 2),

and we can conclude that x(s + m)max < x(s)max if |M| = m.

Scenario 5: |M| = n.

This

case

happens

only

when

x(s)

=

1 n

1,

and

we

know

that

1 n

1

is

an

equilibrium

point.

Having proved Lemma 6, we are now in a position to

prove Theorem 3.

Proof: (Theorem 3) Consider the Lyapunov function

1 V (x(s)) = x(s)max − n .

V (x(s)) ≥ 0 for all s. By Lemma 5, it follows that V (x(s))

is a non-increasing function, i.e., ∆V (x(s)) ≤ 0 for all s.

Furthermore, Lemma 3 suggests that after ﬁnite steps τ > 0,

x(τ) > 0, and we have shown in Lemma 6 that if x(s) > 0

and

x(s) =

1 n

1,

then

x(s)max

must

decrease

in

ﬁnite

steps.

Therefore, V (x(s)) must decrease in ﬁnite updates, and

∆V (x(s))

cannot

be

0

for

inﬁnite

steps

unless

x(s) =

1 n

1,

which means that x(s) must converge to the equilibrium point

x∗

=

1 n

1.

Theorem

3

is

hence

proved.

From Theorem 3, self-conﬁdence vector x(s) in the Mod-

iﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model converges to the democratic

state

1 n

1

as

in

the

original

DeGroot-Friedkin

model

for

the

case of doubly stochastic C. Based on the results, we expect

that in general cases, we should get the same stability results.

Simulation results show that for general stochastic C, self-

conﬁdence vector in the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model converges to the same nontrivial equilibrium x∗ as suggested

in Theorem 1 for the original model. We conjecture that for

the Modiﬁed DeGroot-Friedkin model, if C is a stochastic

matrix that is irreducible with diagonal entries being zero,

then there is only one nontrivial equilibrium, which lies in

the interior of ∆ and for any x(0) ∈ ∆ \ {e1, . . . , en}, x(s) converges to this equilibrium point. We leave veriﬁcation of

this conjecture for future work.

V. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
We ﬁrst provide some numerical simulations for the cases when the relative interaction matrices C are doubly stochastic to demonstrate the convergence result proved in the last

Figure 3 and Figure 4 are the simulation results for complete graph with different initial conditions, while Figure 5 and Figure 6 are for the cases of ring graph. As expected, the maximum and the minimum of the self-conﬁdence levels are not expanding, and the self-conﬁdence level for any individual in all cases converges to 0.2. The convergence

in a complete graph only takes ﬁve or six issues and is signiﬁcantly faster than the cases in a ring graph. Complete graph has more edges than a ring graph, so each individual is able to communicate with more other individuals. Instead, in the ring graph, each individual only has one neighbor to interact with. This may be the reason why complete graph has a faster convergence speed.
To further get some insights about our conjecture on the convergence of the cases when the relative interaction matrices C are stochastic but not doubly stochastic, we also provide some simulations for a directed complete graph but with different weights in Figure 5.5 to Figure 5.8. The

weights are assigned as follows:

As we have conjectured, given a stochastic and irreducible relative interaction matrix C, the self-conﬁdence levels converge, but the convergent values depend on the speciﬁc weights in C, i.e., for different C, the convergent selfconﬁdence vectors are different. Furthermore, note that we no longer have the nice property that the maximum and the minimum of the self-conﬁdence levels are not expanding. In fact, as simulations suggest, it is quite possible that the maximum is increasing or the minimum is decreasing.

Fig. 10: Cc2omplete: x(0) = [0.1459, 0.3592, 0.3462, 0.0859, 0.0628]
Therefore, the proof techniques used in this paper cannot apply in such situation, and we leave the proof of our general conjecture for future work.
VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have introduced a Modiﬁed DeGrootFriedkin model, which allows individuals to update their self-conﬁdence levels after each discussion on a particular issue. We have then investigated the limiting behaviors of the self-conﬁdence vector when a sequence of issues are discussed. A complete analysis for the case when the underlying interaction matrix is doubly stochastic has been provided. As expected, the self-conﬁdence vector converges to the equal-weights vector, meaning that eventually each individual will have the same level of self-conﬁdence. This paper serves as a starting point for this line of research and many questions still remain to be answered. As we have seen, the stability of the modiﬁed model and the original DeGroot-Friedkin model coincides for the case of doubly stochastic interaction matrix, which suggests that there might be similar connections for more general settings.

A future direction that is of particular interest is to mathemat-
ically characterize the properties of the Modiﬁed DeGroot-
Friedkin model for general stochastic interaction matrices under the condition that x(0) ∈ ∆ or x(0) is not necesarrily in ∆. In addition, future work will focus on more general ﬁnitesteps cases (10), i.e., xi(s + 1) = pi(s, T ) for ﬁnite T > 1. We expect that there would be some similar behaviors when we
go from one-step to ﬁnite-steps.
