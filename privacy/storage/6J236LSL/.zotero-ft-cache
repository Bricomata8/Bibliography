Security and privacy issues in OSNs

Threats

Current Status of OSNs

• Cloning • Harvesting • Hijacking • ID Theft • DoS • Pollution

• Ease of data leakage • Ease of impersonation • Limited privacy support • Lack of flexibility in
privacy

OSN as “Big Brother”

The “Big Brother” problem with OSN

• Privacy protection against
– Intruders – Crawlers – Third parties
Does not prevent Application Server from disclosing/exploiting your data

All existing OSN suffer from it!

Security

Safebook - Design Principles

• Decentralization
-P2P architecture

• Cooperation enforcement
-Friends cooperate

• Leveraging existing Trust
-Social trust ⇒ trusted link -Friend = neighbor

• Privacy
-Simple anonymous routing -Based on trusted links -Group Encryption

• k provides b’s outer shell nodes

• a sends profile data request to an entry node serving b

• One of b’s inner shell nodes answers

Data retrieval
• User 1 wants to get User 2’s profile data • User 2’s data is stored by User 3

Privacy by Design
• Privacy through layering • Unlinkability of IDs across layers • Anonymous communication in matryoshkas
