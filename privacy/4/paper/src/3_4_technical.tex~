%Privacy leakage vs. Protection measures: the growing disconnect
In this section we enumerate existing privacy protection measures available to users and one new protection proposal \cite{mayer-do-not-track-00}.

%Blocking requests to targeted third parties
\textbf{Blocking requests to targeted third parties:}
This block measure includes using an advertisement blocking tool (AdBlock Plus \cite{adblockplus}) to syntactically block selected third parties via server/domain name.
Another measure blockhidden \cite{krishnamurthy_privacy_2009} determines the true source of hidden third-parties by examining their authoritative DNS servers.

%Refusing cookies to prevent tracking
\textbf{Refusing cookies to prevent tracking:}
Browsers can be set to refuse all cookies (nocook) or just third-party cookies (no3rdcook).

%Disabling script execution
\textbf{Disabling script execution:}
JavaScript execution can be disabled (nojs) either permanently via the browser or selectively via a tool such as NoScript \cite{NoScript}.

%Filtering protocol headers
\textbf{Filtering protocol headers:}
This is done via extensions or at an intermediary and includes the referrer measure available in some browsers to modify or remove the Referer header in an HTTP request.

%Anonymizing the user and user action
\textbf{Anonymizing the user and user actions:} One such anon measure is anonymizing userâ€™s IP address via an anonymizing proxy or by using Tor.

%Do-Not-Track HTTP header proposal
\textbf{Do-Not-Track HTTP header proposal:}
Researchers proposed,
	in early 2010,
	that browsers add a HTTP DoNot-Track-Header (DNT-Header) \cite{mayer-do-not-track-00} to allow users to express their interest in not being tracked by any aggregator or ad network.
However,
	the extent to which third parties would honor such a header is unknown.
