There have been several quantification models for privacy evaluation in OSNs.

%Objectification of feedback based trust evaluation considering social relationship in sharing economy

The trust has been studied in various research areas for a long time.
Traditional studies on trust evaluation can be separated to three categories: 
	\textbf{Policy/Technical-based}, \textbf{reputation/behavioral-based}, and \textbf{social-based trust}[9].

			
%		Due to the incomplete administrator’s knowledge of the behavior,
%			intent and skill level of attackers,
%			the prediction of their behavior would be a very difficult task.
%		Thus,
%			the use of probabilistic and stochastic models in the area of security evaluation can be an appropriate approach.
%		As shown in literature,
%			stochastic and probabilistic modeling techniques used in the context of dependability evaluation,
%			have been extended and also used to evaluate security metrics,
%			they have been introduced as useful tools for quantitative security analysis.
%		In contrast to stochastic models,
%			which are parameterized with continuous probability distributions,
%			probabilistic models are primarily parameterized with discrete probability distributions.

%		%Markov chains
%		Moayedi et al.\cite{almasizadeh_mean_2014} introduce a novel approach to extend the basic ideas of applying game theory in stochastic modeling.
%		The proposed method classifies the community of hackers based on two main criteria used widely in hacker classifications,
%			which are motivation and skill.
%		They use Markov chains to model the system and compute the transition rates between the states based on the preferences and the skill distributions of hacker classes.
%		The resulting Markov chains can be solved to obtain the desired security measures.



%2.3.1
%Marsh The work of Marsh [107] is said to be the first work on trust in computer science.
%Marsh concentrates on modeling trust between only two agents.
%Thus,
%	the trust management does not treat the collection of recommendations provided by other entities.
%This model identifies knowledge,
%	utility,
%	importance,
%	risk,
%	and perceived competence as important aspects related to trust.
%The model defines three types of trust: 
%	\textbf{dispositional trust},
%		the trust of an entity independent from the possible cooperation partner and the situation;
%	\textbf{general trust},
%		the trust of an entity in another one,
%		independently of the specific situation; 
%	and \textbf{situational trust},
%		which describes the trust of an entity in another one in a specific situation or context.

%2.3.3 (belief)
%Castelfranchi and Falcone The model proposed by Castelfranchi and Falcone [109] was a forefather of cognitive trust models,
%	and it is the base of later models in literature.
%They claim that trust is the mental background of delegation.
%Thus,
%	trust becomes a mental state that yields one entity to delegate a task to other.
%This concept of trust is based on a number of basic beliefs: 
%	competence belief (the other entity can actually do the task),
%	dependence belief (the other entity is necessary or a better choice to perform the task),
%	willingness belief (the other entity is supposed to be willing to do the task),
%	and persistence belief (the other entity is stable on its intentions of performing the task).

%2.3.15 (recommendations)
%SECURE The trust model and trust management in the SECURE project [120] aims to transfer a human notion of trust to ubiquitous computing.
%The main aspect of the trust model is the distinction between unknown and untrustworthy.
%An entity b is unknown to an entity a,
%	if a cannot collect any information about b.
%Whereas b is untrusted if a has information,
%	based on direct interaction or recommendations,
%	stating that b is an untrustworthy entity.
%The trust propagation is based on policies.
%These policies allow entities to explicitly express whose recommendations are considered in a trust decision.
%And finally,
%	the decision making is threshold based.

%2.3.16 (recommendations)
%Wang and Vassileva Wang and Vassileva [121] proposed a trust model using Bayesian networks based on the quality of services provided by entities.
%The entities manage two different values of trust in another entities: competence in providing services,
%	and reliability in providing recommendations about other entities.
%The model uses binary events to qualify transactions (successful or unsuccessful transactions) between entities.
%Trust is modelled based on this transactions and it used to weight the direct and indirect information: 
%	the entity will discard the recommendations from the untrustworthy sources but will combine the recommendations from the trustworthy and unknown sources.

%2.3.17
%XenoTrust XenoTrust is a TMS proposed by Dragovic [122].
%It describes a novel approach to TMS because it is an event-based distributed trust management system.
%This event-based paradigm allows to reduce communication overheads and can simplify,
%	and even enable,
%	the use of TMS in systems with tight communication limitations.
%XenoTrust uses some performance criteria (i.e.,reliability,
%	honesty and throughput) to calculate the trust values assigned to other entities in the system.

%2.3.22
%Corporate Personality Scale The Corporate Personality Scale [51] surveys customers and employees in terms of their perceptions of organization’s personality,
%	focusing on dimensions such as agreeableness,
%	competence and enterprise.

%2.3.24
%TIBFIT The model was proposed by Krasniewski and Varadharajan [127].
%TIBFIT is a trust scheme implemented in the form of a communication protocol.
%It is designed to detect node failures in event-driven WSN.
%This detection is based on the analysis of binary reports from nodes close to any event in the system.
%If TIBFIT detects a node failure,
%	it masks any communication related to this node.
%Additionally it can communicate this failure.
%Therefore,
%	the system as a whole can try to take actions to deal with this situation.

%2.3.25 (blockchain)
%UniTEC UniTEC is the TMS proposed by Kinateder at al. [103].
%This model is focused on experience as base of trust values.
%It uses direct and indirect information and performs direct and indirect trust values updates separately.
%UniTEC gives more weight to the recent experience than to the old one,
%	and previously calculated trust values are expressed as a binary metric (good or bad experiences).
%Thus,
%	as a side-effect,
%	the storage of old experience requires less resources than the new ones.

%2.3.28
%BambooTrust Proposed by Kotsovinos [130],
%	BabooTrust is based on XenoTrust.
%It is focused on global public computing platforms such as grid computing systems and it is built as a P2P system.
%It is a model with a high-performance regarding the distribution of trust information throughout the system.
%It implements as Bamboo hash table in order to facilitate the performance,
%	scalability,
%	efficiency,
%	and load-balancing of the whole system.

%2.3.29 (propagation)
%TidalTrust This trust model proposed by Golbeck [131] is based on ten discrete trust values in the interval [1, 10].
%This model is based on the idea that humans are better in rating on a discrete scale than on a continuous one,
%	the 10 discrete trust values should be enough to approximate continuous trust values.
%Besides,
%	recursive trust or rating propagation allows to infer the rating of subjects by the ratings provided by other entities.
%Since each entity aggregates its collected ratings and passes only a single value to its ancestor in the recursion,
%	the source cannot evaluate which nodes provided their rating.

%2.3.33 (belief)
%Subjective Logic This trust model presented by Jøsang [137] combines elements of Bayesian probability theory with belief theory.
%Besides,
%	related to belief theory,
%	trust is represented by opinions which can be used to express the subjective probability that an entity will behave as expected in the next interaction.
