\section{Introduction \& problem statement}

%From the start of the computer networks,
%	to the mobile applications nowadays,
%	the amount of information shared has been constantly increasing.
%We have all kind of devices,
%	from the big servers in datacenters,
%	the TVs at home,
%	mobile phones,
%	car sensors,
%	...
%The Internet Of Things (IOT) refers to the idea of connecting all the “things”to the Internet.
%By “things”,
%	it refers to any ordinary object that can be useful getting information.
%These “things” should be connected by an embedded device,
%	capable to connect to the Internet in one side,
%	and get information from the “thing” on the other.

\subsection{Background}

\subsection{Purpose (Goal)}

%The first objective of this thesis is to document the capabilities of the Z1 motes and the Contiki OS for the IOT,
%	by building applications to gather data from sensors and the network capabilities both from the motes and the OS.
%Secondly,
%	to build an application using the Z1 motes,
%	and the Contiki OS,
%	using COAP(Constrained Application Protocol) and 6LoWPan(IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) to retrieve information from the motes,
%	and connect them to Sentilo,
%	an open source sensor and actuator platform.

\subsection{Limitations}

%There has been an increased research and development for the Smart Cities.
%The smart cities objective is to gather information from the city,
%	to enhance quality and performance of urban services,
%	to reduce costs and resource consumption,
%	and to engage more effectively and actively with its citizens.
%This project is intended to approach two goals,
%	to be used as a starting point for anyone who wants to use the Contiki OS with the Z1 motes,
%	and to build a simple application for the Smart Cities,
%	to collect data from sensors,
%	and sending it to an information center.

\subsection{Method}

%This document is divided in two parts.
%First,
%	the description of the main tools used to create the experimental environments.
%A description of the Contiki OS,
%	the Z1 motes,
%	and the protocols used to communicate,
%	IEEE 802.14.5, 6LowPAN and CoAP.
%The a brief description of the sensor data collector Sentilo Secondly,
%	a description of the environment setup,
%	and an explanation of how it works.
%Finally,
%	conclusions and future work is presented.
