	The study of privacy and security applied to information and communication technology (ICT) is very wide and embraces many fields of knowledge
		from Sociology and Statistics to Cryptography and Artificial Intelligence.
			%Stalking Online: on User Privacy in Social Networks
	In ICT,
		users are sometimes either oblivious about their privacy,
		or concerned but underestimate the privacy risks.
	%Privacy preserving & privacy policy & privacy measurement
	Previous works on privacy focus on privacy preserving 
		\cite{zhang_privacypreserving_2017}\cite{hasan_survey_2017}\cite{b.s._privacy_2015} 
		and privacy policy conflicts 
			\cite{fong_relationshipbased_2011}.
	Few works 
		\cite{pensa_centralitybased_2016}\cite{wang_privacy_2013}\cite{rebollo-monedero_measurement_2013} 
		have been conducted on privacy measurement due to the challenges to quantify the privacy risk associated with ICT.
	
	To better understand the privacy issues in messaging services,
		we describe in section \ref{sec:background} different types of privacy threats exploited by attackers to access users' private information.
	Next,
		in section \ref{sec:approaches}, 
		we present different approaches available to the end users to deal with such privacy issues.
	Finally, conclusion and future work are described in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

%			%Privacy as a Product: A Case Study in the m-Health Sector
%			When an ICT user accesses a service,
%				in particular,
%				a messaging service,
%				she has to share some information with the service provider,
%				namely identity,
%				type of service required,
%				location,
%				etc.
%			Clearly,
%				the shared information depends on the service but regardless of the exchanged information,
%				to deal with the existing privacy issues, users have to choose between four main options:
%			%	(1) trust the provider and send him all the required information,
%			%	(2) individually protect the data sent to the untrusted provider,
%			%	(3) collaborate with the provider to protect her data,
%			%	or (4) collaborate with other users to protect their data from the provider.

%			%Privacy based on trust
%			\subsubsection{Privacy based on trust}
%				This is probably the most common situation.
%				Users tend to trust service providers because,
%					they do not really have alternatives in many cases.
%				Due to the fact that privacy is considered a right,
%					most countries have regulations that oblige companies to guarantee the privacy of their users.
%				Among this regulation,
%					when users data are released to third parties they should be sanitized so as to guarantee users privacy \cite{chen_privacypreserving_2009}.
%				%	statistical disclosure control techniques are generally used for sanitization.

%			%Privacy based on Individual
%			\subsubsection{Privacy based on Individual User Actions}\label{sssec:num2}
%				Despite the legislation,
%					users might prefer to keep some of their private information away from the service provider.
%				In this case,
%					we assume that the user cannot collaborate with the service provider.
%				For example,
%					in the case of sending a query to an Internet search engine such as Google or Yahoo.
%				The user cannot initiate a \textbf{collaborative protocol} with the search engine,
%					because the search engine is only able to receive and answer queries.

%			%Privacy based on Collaboration with the Provider
%			\subsubsection{Privacy based on Collaboration with the Provider}
%				There are situations in which the service provider might collaborate with the user to protect her privacy by running \textbf{privacy-aware protocols.}
%				TODO

%			%Privacy based on Collaboration with other Users
%			\subsubsection{Privacy based on Collaboration with other Users}
%				This is an evolution of the proposals described in \ref{sssec:num2} in which users collaborate to protect their privacy.
%				In this case,
%					users do not want to trust the provider nor other third parties.
%				TODO
