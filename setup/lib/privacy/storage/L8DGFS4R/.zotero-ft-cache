Propagation of contagion in networks depends on the graph topology. This article is concerned with studying the time-asymptotic behaviour of the extended contact processes on static, undirected, ﬁnite-size networks. This is a contact process with nonzero exogenous infection rate (also known as the -susceptible-infectedsusceptible model). The only known analytical characterization of the equilibrium distribution of this process is for complete networks. For large networks with arbitrary topology, it is infeasible to numerically solve for the equilibrium distribution since it requires solving the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of a matrix that is exponential in N, the size of the network. We derive a condition on the infection rates under which, depending on the degree distribution of the network, the equilibrium distribution of extended contact processes on arbitrary, ﬁnite-size networks is well approximated by a closed-form formulation. We conﬁrm the goodness of the approximation with small networks answering inference questions like the distribution of the percentage of infected individuals and the most-probable equilibrium conﬁguration. We then use the approximation to analyse the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process on the 4941-node US Western power grid.

1. Introduction Classic epidemics models assume homogeneous mixing, where each infected individual has the same number of contacts with susceptible individuals; the infection rate due to contagion is assumed to be dependent on some fraction of the total number of infected and susceptible individuals in the population. Realistically, however, individuals are not homogenous as some individuals are more connected than others. Newer models such as structured population models try to account for distinguishing individual characteristics such as age, location, infectivity, interactions, etc. [2]. Network-based epidemics models incorporate the contact networks, which describe heterogenous interactions between individuals in a given population, as a determinant of the observed dynamics [3–6].

CONTACT PROCESS WITH EXOGENOUS INFECTION AND THE SCALED SIS PROCESS

In this paper, we are interested in understanding the effect of the contact network on the timeasymptotic behaviours of the -SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model [1]. The -SIS (susceptibleinfected-susceptible) model is an extension of the contact process introduced in [7] by assuming a nonzero exogenous (i.e., spontaneous) infection rate. We will refer to the -SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model as the extended contact process in this paper. In addition to a nonzero exogenous infection rate, the extended contact process also assumes that the infection rate of a susceptible agent is linearly dependent on the number of contacts with infected individuals (i.e., the number of infected neighbours in the contact network), thereby explicitly coupling the underlying contact network to the dynamics.
Due to the inclusion of a nonzero exogenous infection rate, the extended contact process does not have a trivial equilibrium distribution. Computing the equilibrium distribution of a ﬁnite-length Markov process, such as the extended contact process, requires solving an eigenvalue-eigenvector problem. As the number of Markov states is exponential in the size of the network, it is an infeasible computation problem to solve for the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process parameterized by networks with hundreds or thousands of individuals. When dealing with large-scale networks, researchers usually approximate them with inﬁnite-size networks using the mean-ﬁeld approximation [1]. We take a different approach and show that, for a subclass of extended contact processes, their equilibrium distribution can be approximated by that of the scaled SIS process, for which we found the closed-form equilibrium distribution of the process on arbitrary, undirected, ﬁnite-size network topology [8, 9]. Unlike the extended contact process, which assumes that the infection rate of a healthy agent is linearly dependent on its number of infected neighbours, the scaled SIS process assumes an exponential dependence.
When the infection rates of the scaled SIS process are appropriately scaled to equal the rates of the extended contact process, we can describe the equilibrium behaviour of the extended contact process for arbitrary networks with thousands of individuals without any further approximation. The closedform equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process informs us that its equilibrium behaviour depends on (1) individual susceptibility to be in healthy vs. infected state (i.e., the ratio of the exogenous infection rate over the healing rate) and (2) the effective contribution of contagion vs. spontaneous infection (i.e., the ratio of the endogenous infection rate over the exogenous infection rate). With a known equilibrium distribution, we can answer inference questions such as what is the distribution of the percentage of infected individuals or what is the most-probable conﬁguration, the conﬁguration with maximum equilibrium probability. The former informs us of the vulnerability of the entire population, and the latter can help us identify which agents and network substructures are more susceptible to infection.
We review the extended contact process in Section 2.1, the scaled SIS process in Section 2.2. We compare and contrast the two network processes in Section 2.3. In Section 3, we derive a condition, depending on the degree distribution of the network, under which the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process is well approximated by that of the scaled SIS process. In Section 4, we compare the true equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process with its approximation for six different 16-node networks using total variation distance. The small size of these networks ensures that we can compute the true equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process. These studies conﬁrm the goodness of the approximation. We discuss the most-probable conﬁguration of the extended contact process and the approximate distribution in Section 5. We then use our approximation to study the extended contact process in a much larger network for which it is infeasible to resort to numerical method. This is carried out in Section 6 where we examine the equilibrium behaviour of the extended contact process on the 4941-node US Western power grid. Section 7 concludes the paper.

2. Contact process and scaled SIS process
The contact process models the spread of infection in a network [7]. It is a binary state, irreducible, continuous-time Markov process on a static, simple, connected, undirected network G(V , E). See [10, 11] for review of continuous-time Markov processes, [12, 13] for review of graph theory. Each node in the network is an agent in the population. Each node can be in one of two states, {0, 1}, representing healthy or infected state, respectively. For a network with |V | = N nodes and |E| edges, the state of the process at some time t ≥ 0, which is also the microscopic network conﬁguration, is

x = [x1, x2, . . . xN ]T , where xi = {0, 1}.
As a result, there are 2N possible conﬁgurations. The contact process models SIS epidemics on networks. There are two types of state transitions that
represent, respectively, (1) healing of infected agents and (2) infection of susceptible agents.

(1) Consider the conﬁguration
x = [x1, x2, . . . , xj = 1, xj+1, . . . xN ]T . Let Tj−x be the conﬁguration where the jth agent heals:
Tj−x = [x1, x2, . . . , xj = 0, xj+1, . . . xN ]T . The contact process transitions from x to Tj−x in an exponentially distributed random amount of time with transition rate

q(x, Tj−x) = μ.

(1)

Parameter μ is the healing rate. Without loss of generality, we can assume μ = 1. (2) Consider the conﬁguration

x = [x1, x2, . . . , xk−1, xk = 0, . . . xN ]T .
Let Tk+x be the conﬁguration where the kth agent becomes infected: Tk+x = [x1, x2, . . . , xk−1, xk = 1, . . . xN ]T .
The contact process transitions from x to Tk+x in an exponentially distributed random amount of time with transition rate

N

q(x, Tk+x) = βe xiAik,

(2)

i=1

where A = [Aik] is the adjacency matrix of the underlying network. The parameter βe > 0 is the endogenous infection rate. The infection rate of the kth agent is linearly dependent on its number of infected neighbours

N

mk = xiAik.

(3)

CONTACT PROCESS WITH EXOGENOUS INFECTION AND THE SCALED SIS PROCESS

715

The infection rate (2) assumes that the infected neighbours are independent. In the contact process, when
all the agents in the network are healthy, the process dies out. The conﬁguration where all the agents are healthy (x0 = [0, 0, . . . , 0]T ) is an absorbing state of the Markov process. For networks with ﬁnite number of agents, the contact process will eventually reach the conﬁguration x0 and remain there indeﬁnitely.
Thus, the equilibrium distribution is trivial for contact processes on ﬁnite-size networks [7].

2.1 Extended contact process

In the contact process, a healthy agent can only become infected through contagion from an infected
neighbour. It may be the case that a healthy agent (or working component) may also become infected
(or fail) due to an exogenous (i.e., outside of the network) source —the agent is infected spontaneously [1, 14, 15]. For SIS epidemics, this is captured by a nonzero exogenous infection rate, λ. The transition rate of the extended contact process from x to Tk+x is

q(x, Tk+x) = λ + βemk,

(4)

where mk (3) is the number of infected neighbours of agent k. The infection rate (4) assumes that the exogenous infection source and the endogenous infection sources (i.e., infected neighbours) are independent. The healing rate remains the same as (1). We call this modiﬁed model the extended contact process; reference [1] referred to it as the -SIS model. When agent k has 0 infected neighbours, the rate at which agent k becomes infected is the exogenous infection rate. For a system where spontaneous infection is rare, the exogenous infection rate can be made arbitrarily small, but for the extended contact process, it has to remain greater than zero.
The conﬁguration where all the agents are healthy (x0 = [0, 0, . . . , 0]T ) is no longer an absorbing state in the Markov process since susceptible agents can spontaneously become infected. As a result, the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process is no longer trivial. There are currently no known tractable analytical results regarding this equilibrium distribution for the extended contact process for arbitrary network topologies; reference [1] provided analytical results when the network is a complete graph.
The equilibrium distribution can be calculated numerically. However, this approach is infeasible for large networks. In the case of an irreducible, continuous-time Markov process, the equilibrium distribution, π , is the left eigenvector of the transition rate matrix, Qe, corresponding to the 0 eigenvalue. However, the transition rate matrix of the extended contact process is a 2N × 2N matrix, where N is the size of the network. Solving for the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process over a 200-node network means ﬁnding the eigenvector of a 2200 ×2200 matrix; even taking into account sparsity, such computation is clearly infeasible.
We will show in this article that we can obtain an approximation to the equilibrium distribution over arbitrary network topologies for a subset of extended contact processes using the scaled SIS process.

2.2 Scaled SIS process
We introduced the scaled SIS process in [8, 16]. Like the contact process, it is a binary state, irreducible, continuous-time Markov process on static, simple, connected, undirected networks. The scaled SIS process assumes that an agent can be in one of 2 states, that is, {0, 1}, representing healthy or infected state, respectively. The space of possible conﬁgurations, of the scaled SIS process is the same as that of the contact and extended contact process. The scaled SIS process also accounts for two types of state transitions representing (1) healing of infected agents and (2) infection of susceptible agents.

(1) Consider the conﬁguration

x = [x1, x2, . . . , xj = 1, xj+1, . . . xN ]T .
Let Tj−x be the conﬁguration where the jth agent heals:
Tj−x = [x1, x2, . . . , xj = 0, xj+1, . . . xN ]T .
The scaled SIS process transitions from x to Tj−x in an exponentially distributed random amount of time with transition rate

q(x, Tj−x) = μ.

(5)

The healing rate of the scaled SIS process is the same as the healing rate of the contact process. (2) Consider the conﬁguration

x = [x1, x2, . . . , xk−1, xk = 0, . . . xN ]T .
Let Tk+x be the conﬁguration where the kth agent becomes infected:
Tk+x = [x1, x2, . . . , xk−1, xk = 1, . . . xN ]T .
The scaled SIS process transitions from x to Tk+x in an exponentially distributed random amount of time with transition rate

q(x, Tk+x) = λβsmk ,

(6)

where mk is the number of infected neighbours of agent k as deﬁned in (3). When the number of infected neighbours of agent k is 0, the infection rate is λ. Like the extended contact process, the healing and exogenous infection rates of the scaled SIS process are μ and λ respectively. Unlike the infection rate of the extended contact process (4), the infection rate of the kth agent in the scaled
SIS process is assumed to be exponentially dependent on its number of infected neighbours mk. The parameter βs > 0 is not the endogenous infection rate but rather the endogenous infection factor. The factor βs is not a dimensional parameter like the endogenous infection rate βe of the extended contact process.

We proved in [8], that, for the scaled SIS process, the resulting continuous-time Markov process is a reversible Markov process; a reversible Markov process is a stochastic process that is statistically the same forward in time as it is in reverse [11]. Further, we showed that the unique equilibrium distribution of the scaled SIS process over any undirected network topology described by the adjacency matrix, A, is:

2.3 Extended contact process vs. scaled SIS process
When the infection is purely exogenous (i.e, no neighbour-to-neighbour contagion), the extended contact process and the scaled SIS process are identical. The network structure does not affect the process. In this case, the process is similar to the well-known birth-death process in a ﬁnite-size population where the exogenous infection rate λ is akin to the birth rate and the healing rate μ is akin to the death rate [11].
The dynamics becomes dependent on the network when the infection rate also accounts for contagion. In both the extended contact process and the scaled SIS process, the infection rate of a susceptible agent is a function of the number of infected neighbours. However, the two models make different assumptions regarding the underlying mechanism of the contagion process:

Extended contact process The extended contact process is parameterized by the exogenous infection rate, λ, the healing rate, μ, and the endogenous infection rate βe. Consider the scenario in Fig. 1. Let T3 be the random amount of time it takes for agent V3 to become infected. Each infected neighbour of agent V3 (i.e., V1, V2, V4) and the exogenous (i.e., external) source may infect V3 in an exponentially distributed amount of time T3i ∼ exp(βe), i = 1, 2, 4, and T3e ∼ exp(λ), respectively. Therefore, T3 = min{T31, T32, T34, T3e}. Assuming that these sources act independently, then T3 ∼ exp(λ + 3βe). As the number of infected neighbours of V3 increases, its infection rate also increases. The extended contact process models a distributed contagion scenario where all the infection sources compete to be the ﬁrst to infect a healthy
agent.

Scaled SIS process The scaled SIS process is parameterized by the exogenous infection rate, λ, healing rate, μ, and the endogenous factor βs. Consider the scenario in Fig. 1. Let T3 be the random amount of time it takes for

process

assumes

that

exp(λ(βs)3),

where T

a healthy agent becomes infected when it has no infected neighbours. When βs > 1, as the number

of infected neighbours of V3 increases, its infection rate also increases. Unlike the extended contact

process, the scaled SIS process assumes an aggregate contagion scenario.

3. Time-asymptotic behaviour of the extended contact process
For ﬁnite-size networks, unlike the contact process, the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process is nontrivial. In this section, we show that, for a subclass of extended contact processes over networks of arbitrary topology, this equilibrium distribution is well approximated by the equilibrium distribution of the scaled SIS process; for these processes, the time-asymptotic behaviour of both processes are similar.
The dynamics of a continuous-time, ﬁnite-size Markov process is summarized by its transition rate matrix Q, where the entry Qi,j corresponds to the transition rate of going from a Markov state i to another Markov state j. The unnormalized equilibrium distribution π of a Markov process is the left eigenvector corresponding to the 0 eigenvalue

πQ = 0.

The non-diagonal entries of the transition rate matrix of the extended contact process, Qe, and the scaled SIS process, Qs correspond to healing or infection rates of different individuals according to the rates (1) and (4) for the extended contact process and rates (5) and (6) for the scaled SIS process. Since there are N individuals in a network, the total number of Markov states is 2N . Even for moderately sized networks (i.e., tens of nodes), it becomes numerical infeasible to solve for the equilibrium distribution using the eigenvalue-eigenvector approach. On the other hand, as we proved previously in [8], the equilibrium distribution of the scaled SIS process can be derived in closed-form without resorting to numerical computations. The equilibrium distribution of some extended contact processes can be approximated.

Theorem 3.1 [Proof in Appendix 7] Consider the extended contact process with exogenous infection rate λ, healing rate μ, and endogenous infection rate βe, over a static, simple, connected, undirected network of arbitrary topology, G. The mean and variance of the degree distribution of G are mean(d) and var(d), respectively. Let

If

then the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process is well approximated by

CONTACT PROCESS WITH EXOGENOUS INFECTION AND THE SCALED SIS PROCESS

719

where A is the adjacency matrix of the network G, and Z is the partition function. The approximate distribution, πapprox(x), is the equilibrium distribution (8) of a scaled SIS process over the same network G with exogenous infection rate λ, healing rate μ, and endogenous infection rate βs = 1 + .

The term is the ratio of the endogenous infection rate, βe over the exogenous infection rate, λ. When = 0, infected neighbours are not a source of infection in the population. Consequently, this means that the infection and healing rates of the extended contact process and the scaled SIS process are identical (i.e., Qe = Qs). The processes would therefore have the same equilibrium distribution.
When > 0 but small, then Qe ≈ Qs. In this case, the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process and the scaled SIS process are approximately the same. Theorem 3.1 quantiﬁes how
small needs to be for the approximation to hold. The approximation depends on rates and on the degree distribution of the underlying network. The distribution πapprox(x) is a better approximate of the true equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process for networks with small average degree and/or
low degree variance.

Effects of

and

on the extended contact process at equilibrium

Equation 8 shows that the approximation of the equilibrium distribution of some extended contact pro-

cesses

depends

on

the

dimensionless

ratios

λ μ

and

. This section analyses how these ratios determine

the dynamics.

Let Th ∼ exp(μ) denote the random amount of time it takes for an infected agent to heal; it is equivalent to the amount of time an individual is in the infected state. Since μ is the same for all the

individuals, the average amount of time to heal is the same for all infected individuals. For the extended

contact process, all infection sources are independent. Suppose that susceptible agent i has one infected

neighbour. Let Ti1 ∼ exp(βe) be the random amount of time it takes for susceptible agent i to be infected

by this infected neighbour, and Tie ∼ exp(λ) be the random amount of time it takes for susceptible agent

i to become infected by an exogenous source.

The

ratio

determines

the

the probability that an individual is in the healthy state longer than in the infected state is

Therefore,

this means that, on average, assuming no endogenous contagion, an individual spends more time in the

When < 1, then P(Tie ≤ Ti1) > 0.5. If a susceptible agent i has m > 1 contagious neighbours, the probability that agent i is infected by the exogenous source rather than by the neighbours decreases to

This shows that when < 1 and there are few infected individuals in the population, new infections are most likely due to the exogenous source. However, when there are many infected individuals in the population and the there are sufﬁcient contacts between infected and susceptible individuals, new infections are more likely to be due to contagion.
The probability that an infected agent heals before it infects a susceptible neighbour is

where the ratio

When

that an infected agent will heal before it can infect a susceptible neighbour is larger than 0.5. Whereas

when

βe μ

1 the probability that

an

infected

agent will

before it can infect a

susceptible neighbour

is less than 0.5. However, an infected agent may have many susceptible neighbours depending on the

network topology.

4. Numerical experiments
We showed that the extended contact process can be well approximated by the scaled SIS process. In this section, we study Theorem 3.1 with numerical simulations. We will compare the true equilibrium distribution, πe(x), of the extended contact process, with infection and healing rates (λ, μ, βe) over network G, with the approximation distribution, πapprox(x). The true distribution, πe(x), is found numerically by forming the transition rate matrix, Qe, according to rates (1) and (4) and solving for the left eigenvector of Qe corresponding to eigenvalue 0. The approximate distribution, πapprox(x), is obtained from the closed-form equation according to Theorem 3.1

To quantify the difference between the exact and the approximation equilibrium distribution, πe(x) and πapprox(x), we use the total variation distance (TVD) [17]:

TVD(πe, πapprox) = 2

|πe(x) − πapprox(x)|.

(9)

x∈X

When the two distributions are equal, TVD is 0. The maximum TVD between any two probability distributions over the same support is 1.

CONTACT PROCESS WITH EXOGENOUS INFECTION AND THE SCALED SIS PROCESS

721

As the true distribution of the extended contact process, πe(x), is obtained by solving the zero eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of Qe, which is a 2N × 2N matrix, we are restricted to examples with small networks of size N.
To show numerically the goodness of the approximation, we choose to consider the six 16-node networks shown in Fig. 2 with the following structural characteristics: 1) average degree mean(d), 2) degree variance var(d), and 3) density as deﬁned in reference [3]

D

=

2|E| N(N −

1) .

(10)

Using the degree characteristics, we can compute for each network its limiting condition on as according to Theorem 3.1,

u=

2 .
var(d) + (mean(d))2 − mean(d)

(11)

Networks A and B are very structured graphs in that they have small average degree and degree variance; they are very sparse graphs and also have the largest upperbound u. Network F is also a very sparse graph but it has a large degree variance. Networks C and D are sparse and heterogeneous graphs. Network E is not a sparse graph, which by deﬁnition has D << 1. In this respect, it is arguable that Network E is a not a realistic real-world network, which tends to be sparse. Network E has large average degree and degree variance, resulting in a small u.
In Matlab, on a Microsoft Azure cloud virtual machine with 2.6GHz Intel Xeon E5-2670 and 56GB of RAM, for a 16-node network, it takes approximately 2 s to generate the sparse transition rate matrix Qe and 460 s to solve for the eigenvector corresponding to the 0 eigenvalue. For a 20-node network, it takes approximately 30 s to generate the transition rate matrix Qe; we receive an OUT-OF-MEMORY error when computing the eigenvector.

4.1 Results: πe(x) and πapprox(x)

When is much smaller than u, the true and the approximate distributions are approximately the same.

For

the

extended

contact

process

with

parameters

λ μ

=

0.7,

= 0.0023, the TVD for the six networks

shown in Fig. 2 are on the order of 10−5 to 10−6. This means that the true distribution and the approximate

distribution are practically identical.

Next,

we consider

the

extended contact process with parameters

λ μ

=

0.7,

= 0.4333, which is

below u for Networks A, B, C and D and above u for Networks E and F. TVD for Networks A, B,

C and D are 0.0266, 0.0290, 0.0848 and 0.1505, respectively. For Networks F, the deviation is large at

0.6652. Surprising, although = 0.4333 > u for Network E, TVD is relatively small at 0.1609. In the left columns of Figs 3 and 4, we plot the true equilibrium distribution, πe(x), of the extended contact process together with the approximate equilibrium distribution, πapprox(x). The probability values are plotted in log scale on the Y-axis. The 216 network conﬁgurations are on the X-axis. The conﬁgurations

are ordered such that high probability conﬁgurations in the true distribution are in the centre. We can

see highly probable conﬁgurations in the true distribution are also highly probable in the approximate

distribution.

In the right columns of Figs 3 and 4, we plot P(Y ) for the true distribution of the extended contact process, the approximate distribution, and the case when there is no contagion from infected individual to healthy neighbours (i.e., βe = 0). When there is no contagion, the network structure is irrelevant, and P(Y ) is the same for all six sample networks. The inclusion of contagion increases the probability that higher percentage of the population will be infected. When TVD is small, the distribution P(Y ) of the extended contact process is also well approximated by

P(Yapprox = y) =

πapprox(x).

x∈X

:

1T x N

=y

We can see from Fig. 4d that when TVD is large, the fraction of infected individuals in the approximate distribution, Yapprox, is stochastically larger than Y . This is due to the fact that the approximate distribution, derived from the scaled SIS process, has higher infection rate than the extended contact process. Table 1 shows the expected percentage of infected individuals for all three distributions. We can see that

E[Yno contagion] ≤ E[Y ] ≤ E[Yapprox].

for the six network topologies shown in Fig. 2. Different curves in each ﬁgure correspond to equilibrium

distributions

with

different

λ μ

values.

As expected, when << u for all six topologies, TVD is negligible for all the networks. Deviation

between the true equilibrium distribution and the approximation increases as moves toward u. Since

u depends on the mean and variance of the degree distribution, the rate of increase of TVD as increases

from 0 also depends on the mean and variance of the degree. Surprisingly, this increase is not monotonic

for all network topologies. As increases to values larger than u, TVD may decrease. We observe this decrease in TVD for both Network E in Fig. 5e and Network F in Fig. 5f. These networks have large

degree variance; this means that some nodes have much larger degree than others. At larger , these highly

connected nodes increase the probability of conﬁgurations with large numbers of infected individuals,

thereby decreasing the deviation between the true distribution and the approximate distribution.

From these studies, we conclude that the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process can be well approximated by πapprox(x) when the condition in Theorem 3.1 is satisﬁed. We will use this result in Section 6 where we study the equilibrium distribution for the extended contact process on a much

larger real-world network—the 4941-node US Western power grid [18].

5. Most-probable conﬁguration
We showed in Figs 3 and 4 that, for a range of the dynamic parameters, the equilibrium distribution πe(x) of the extended contact process is well approximated by the equilibrium distribution πapprox(x) of the scaled SIS process. In this section, we study the more detailed question of ﬁnding the most-probable conﬁguration (i.e., the conﬁguration with the maximum equilibrium probability). We consider the small networks of Section 4 so that we can compare the true most-probable conﬁguration with the maximizer of the approximation distribution. In Section 6, we apply the approximation to solve for the most-probable conﬁguration of a large real-world network.
For network processes, the most-probable conﬁguration depends on the infection and healing rates and on the underlying network topology. It identiﬁes the set of agents that are most likely to be infected in the long run. These are the more vulnerable agents in the network. If the most probable conﬁguration is x0 = [0, 0, . . . 0]T , all agents are healthy, whereas if the most-probable conﬁguration is xN = [1, 1, . . . 1]T , then all agents are at risk regardless of their location in the network. Except for these two cases, ﬁnding which agents are infected in the most-probable conﬁguration is not trivial. The most-probable conﬁguration of the extended contact process is

xe∗

=

arg

max
x∈X

πe(x).

For the extended contact process, there is no closed-form description of the equilibrium distribution, so

this problem can only be solved numerically, which is infeasible for large-scale networks.

On the other hand, as stated in Theorem 3.1, when << u, the equilibrium distribution, πe(x), of the extended contact process is well approximated by the equilibrium distribution, πapprox(x), of a scaled SIS process with endogenous infection rate βs = 1 + . We proved in [9] that, in this case,

the most-probable conﬁguration of the scaled SIS process can be solved in polynomial-time because it

corresponds to solving for the minimum of a submodular function. It is therefore possible to identify

vulnerable network substructures for networks with hundreds and thousands of agents using πapprox(x).

From the simulation results in the previous section, we now compare the most-probable conﬁguration

of the extended contact process with the most-probable conﬁguration found with the approximating

scaled SIS process. Table 2 lists for the six networks in Fig. 2, the TVD between the distributions, the

corresponding most-probable conﬁgurations, and the probabilities of the most-probable conﬁguration for

Figure 6c shows that the most-probable conﬁguration for Network C is neither x0 nor xN but a conﬁguration where nine agents are infected while seven agents are healthy; we call most-probable conﬁgurations that are neither x0 nor xN non-degenerate most-probable conﬁgurations.

For an extended

contact

process

with

exogenous

infection rate and

healing

rate,

λ μ

=

0.9744,

and

endogenous infection rate, = 0.02, the epidemic is minor in Networks A, B and F, but should be of

concern in Networks D and E. In Network C, a subset of agents are more at risk than others. Different

networks have different risk levels because the propagation of contagious infection is dependent on the

underlying network topology. The result in Fig. 6c conﬁrms for the extended contact process what we

had proved for the scaled SIS process in [9], namely that, in the most-probable conﬁguration, infected

agents belong to dense subgraphs in the network.

Networks with high density, such as Networks D and E are more at risk to contagion than networks

with low density such as Networks A, B and F. Network F, although it has the largest maximum degree,

has the same density as Network A. It is difﬁcult for infection to spread in Network F because the centre

agent is the only agent capable of transmitting the infection to its neighbours. We showed in [9] that the

nine infected agents in Network C are more at risk of infection than the other agents because they form

a subgraph that is denser than the overall network. Using the deﬁnition of density in (10), the density

of the subgraph induced by these nine individuals is 0.333 compared with the density of the overall

network, which is 0.1583; these nine agents are especially well connected and are therefore more prone

to contagion.

Table 3 lists the TVD between the distributions, the most-probable conﬁgurations for the extended

contact process and the approximate scaled SIS process, and the probabilities of the most-probable

conﬁgurations for

λ μ

=

0.7 and

= 0.4333. As

is larger, the most-probable conﬁgurations may

not be the same in the true and approximation distributions, as for Networks B and C, even though the

probabilities of the most-probable conﬁgurations are similar. Alternatively as for Networks D and E, xe∗ and xa∗pprox are identical but the corresponding probabilities are magnitudes apart.
Note that the conﬁguration in Fig. 6c, where nine agents are more at risk of infection than others,

remains the most-probable conﬁguration for Network C. Even though this conﬁguration no longer has the

highest equilibrium probability in the approximate distribution, it remains a highly probable conﬁguration.

This reinforces our observation from Figs 3 and 4 that conﬁgurations with high probabilities in the

approximate distribution are also highly probable in the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact

process. The substructures that are vulnerable for the scaled SIS process, the non-degenerate most-

probable conﬁgurations, are also vulnerable substructures of the extended contact process.

6. Real-world network
Real-world networks are often much larger than 16 nodes. Assuming that exogenous infection corresponds to spontaneous component failure, endogenous infection corresponds to cascading failure, and healing

to recovery, we use the extended contact process to model blackout processes in the power grid. We use

the 4941-node network representation of the US Western power grid [18]. It is a sparse, heterogeneous

network. Its size precludes the numerical computation of the equilibrium distribution of the extended

contact process; the transition rate matrix is a 24941 × 24941 matrix. In this section, we use Theorem 3.1

to approximate πe(x) by the closed-form equilibrium distribution πapprox(x) when < u = 0.5108.

distribution for the extended contact process with parameters

= 0.08. This computation can be done efﬁciently (i.e., less than 1 s on a standard desktop) [19]. These

conﬁgurations are non-degenerate and show the subsets of components (black coloured nodes) that are

more vulnerable to failures than other subsets (white coloured nodes).

7. Conclusion

This article derived a condition under which the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process

[1, 15] is well approximated by the equilibrium distribution of a scaled SIS process [8]. The two processes

are similar when

βe λ

<<

u. The condition

u is larger when the underlying network is sparsely connected

with small degree variance than when the network is densely connected. With the closed-form approximate

equilibrium distribution, we can study the behaviour of the extended contact process on networks with

thousands of nodes whereas we can only calculate the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact

process using numerical methods for networks with tens of nodes.

We show that the equilibrium behaviour of a subclass of extended contact processes depends on two

parameter

ratios:

λ μ

and

and two statistics: the number of infected nodes and the number of edges

where both end nodes can be infected. Further, using the closed-form approximation to the equilibrium

CONTACT PROCESS WITH EXOGENOUS INFECTION AND THE SCALED SIS PROCESS

731

distribution, we can solve for the most-probable conﬁguration in polynomial-time. This shows which subset of nodes in the network may be more vulnerable than other subsets. The more vulnerable nodes are reﬂected by the non-degenerate solutions of the most-probable conﬁguration problem. As we discussed in [9], non-degenerate solutions arise due to the existence of subgraphs in the network with higher densities than the overall network. Our method not only proves that more densely connected communities are more vulnerable to contagion, but also gives a polynomial-time method to identify such communities.

Appendix. Proof of Theorem 3.1
Theorem Consider the extended contact process with exogenous infection rate λ, healing rate μ, and endogenous infection rate βe, over a static, simple, connected, undirected network of arbitrary topology, G. The mean and variance of the degree distribution of G are mean(d) and var(d), respectively. Let

.

If

then the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process is well approximated by

x ∈ X,

where A is the adjacency matrix of the network G, and Z is the partition function. The approximate distribution, πapprox(x), is the equilibrium distribution (8) of a scaled SIS process over the same network G with exogenous infection rate λ, healing rate μ, and endogenous infection rate βs = 1 + .

Proof. From the theory of continuous-time Markov processes [10], the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process is the left eigenvector of the transition rate matrix, Qe, corresponding to the 0 eigenvalue:

π Qe = 0.
Entries of the transition rate matrix of the extended contact process, Qe, correspond to the transition rates from one Markov state to another according to the rates (1) and (4) depending on parameters λ, βe, μ. Entries of the transition rate matrix of the scaled SIS process, Qs, correspond to the transition rates from one Markov state to another according to the rates (5) and (6) depending on parameters λ, βs, μ. Consequently, the only entries that may differ between Qe and Qs correspond to the infection rates.

CONTACT PROCESS WITH EXOGENOUS INFECTION AND THE SCALED SIS PROCESS

733

When = 0, there is no contagion from infected agent to susceptible neighbour. As a result, Qe = Qs. When << 1, then Qe ≈ Qs. We can derive a more insightful condition on that depends on the underlying network structure.
Consider a susceptible agent with m infected neighbours. Then the Taylor series expansion of the infection rate of the susceptible agent under the dynamics of the scaled SIS process with parameters λ, βs = 1 + , μ is
λβsm = λ(1 + )m ≈ λ + λ m + higher order terms.
The linear term of the Taylor series expansion is the infection rate of the extended contact process, with parameters λ, βe, μ. When m = 0, then Qe = Qs. Otherwise, for Qe ≈ Qs, the higher order terms must be negligible. This means that the quadratic term
m(m − 1) 2 << 1. 2
Where all neighbours of the susceptible agent are infected, m is the nodal degree. Therefore the worst case scenario, in the sense that Qe and Qs have the largest deviation, is dependent on the maximum nodal degree, dmax, of the underlying network. The most restrictive condition on is
dmax(dmax − 1) 2 << 1. 2
However, instead of working with the worst case scenario, we considered the case where
E m(m − 1) 2 << 1. 2
As a result, we derived the following, less restrictive, condition on ,

<<

2 var(d) + (mean(d))2 − mean(d) ,

where mean(d) and var(d) are the mean and variance of the degree distribution. Since the infection rates are similar for the extended contact process and the scaled SIS process, then Qe ≈ Qs. Therefore, the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process with parameters λ, βe, μ, can be approximated by the equilibrium distribution of the scaled SIS process with parameters λ, βs = 1 + , μ, which we
derived in [8] to be
