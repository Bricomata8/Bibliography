  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication presents a new paradigm in mobile networking to facilitate data exchange between physically proximate devices. The development of D2D is driven by mobile operators to harvest short range communications for improving network performance and supporting proximity-based services. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental and interrelated aspects of D2D communication, security and privacy, which are essential for the adoption and deployment of D2D. We present an extensive review of the state-of-the-art solutions for enhancing security and privacy in D2D communication. By summarizing the challenges, requirements, and features of different proposals, we identify lessons to be learned from existing studies and derive a set of ``best practices.'' The primary goal of our work is to equip researchers and developers with a better understanding of the underlying problems and the potential solutions for D2D security and privacy. To inspire follow-up research, we identify open problems and highlight future directions with regard to system and communication design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review to address the fundamental security and privacy issues in D2D communication.},

  abstract = {As the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth, it is no surprise that many recent cyber attacks are IoT-enabled: The attacker initially exploits some vulnerable IoT technology as a first step towards compromising a critical system that is connected, in some way, with the IoT. For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},

These networks need to be able to offer services at high quality levels for a massive amount of users and smart objects. In this paper, we analyse the Quality of Service (QoS) of our Relay and Mobility Scheme for the Internet of Things (REMOS-IOT), which consists of IoT objects that provide several services such as video applications, CCTV monitoring and sensor data, smart gateways, which interconnect the smart devices, and a cloud-deployed platform which is used for resource management and decision-making to improve network quality. This paper presents a novel algorithm which considers QoS, devices locations and service relevance metrics and creates more appropriate clusters for the networked IoT objects in order to improve IoT services quality. Objects are then attached to gateways or relay devices with better network quality, while the performance of poorly operating clusters is also improved.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are built upon a shared medium that makes it easy for adversaries to conduct radio interference, or jamming, attacks that effectively cause a denial of service of either transmission or reception functionalities. These attacks can easily be accomplished by an adversary by either bypassing MAC-layer protocols or emitting a radio signal targeted at jamming a particular channel. In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.},

Our original approach, called Red Swarm, suggests a potentially customized route to each vehicle by using several spots located at traffic lights in order to avoid traffic jams by using V2I communications. That is quite different from other existing proposals, as it deals with real maps and actual streets, as well as several road traffic distributions. We propose an evolutionary algorithm (later efficiently parallelized) to optimize our case studies which have been imported from OpenStreetMap into SUMO as they belong to a real city. We have also developed a Rerouting Algorithm which accesses the configuration of the Red Swarm and communicates the route chosen to vehicles, using the spots (via WiFi link). Moreover, we have developed three competing algorithms in order to compare their results to those of Red Swarm and have observed that Red Swarm not only achieved the best results, but also outperformed the experts' solutions in a total of 60 scenarios tested, with up to 19\% shorter travel times.},

We solve real scenarios in the city of Malaga (Spain), thus enriching the OpenStreetMap info by adding traffic lights, sensors, routes and vehicle flows. The result is then imported into the SUMO traffic simulator to be used as a method for calculating the fitness of solutions.

The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

The focus of the present work is on advancing the state of the art of deterministic 6TiSCH schedules towards more flexible but equally reliable distributed approaches. In addition, this paper aims to introduce the first implementation of 6TiSCH networks for factory automation environments: it outlines the challenges faced to overcome the scalability issues inherent to multi-hop dense low-power networks; the experimental results confirm that the naturally unreliable radio medium can support time-critical and reliable applications.

We decentralize the problem by managing the traffic of each intersection independently from others. We define control agents which are able to synchronize the multiple flows of vehicles in each intersection, by alternating vehicles from both directions. We present experimental results in simulation, which allow to evaluate the approach and to compare it with a traffic light strategy. These results show the important gain in terms of time and energy at an intersection and in a network.},

In addition, the applications of the STPN to eight-phase, six-phase, and two-phase traffic-light control systems are modularized. The advantage of the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the behaviors of traffic lights in terms of the conditions and events that cause phase alternations. Moreover, the size of the urban traffic network control system can be easily extended with our proposed modular technique. An analysis of the control models is performed via a reachability graph method to demonstrate how the models enforce the transitions of the traffic lights.},

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},

  abstract = {Vehicle and pedestrian collisions often result in fatality to the vulnerable road users, indicating a strong need of technologies to protect such vulnerable road users. Wireless communications have potential to support road safety by enabling road users to exchange information. In contrast to vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications for avoidance of inter-vehicle collisions, very limited efforts are made on communication mechanisms for pedestrian safety. This paper addresses the issue in a concrete way. We first formulate the requirement of the minimum information exchange distance for providing road users to have the necessary amount of time to perceive the situation and react. We then report our field tests and measurement based analysis to investigate if a Wi-Fi system can satisfy the application requirement. We also introduce a pedestrian protection application, V2ProVu, which provides the functionalities of the Wi-Fi communications, risk calculation, and hazard alarming. Our study discloses several useful insights including 1) information exchange for a velocity of 80 km/h has to be made before vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) distance is below 72 meters and 2) while this requirement is not too hard for radio communications technologies, the V2P communication range is greatly reduced if the signal is blocked by a human body.},

  abstract = {Road safety is one of the most important applications of vehicular networks. However, improving pedestrian safety via vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) wireless communication has not been extensively addressed. In this paper, our vision is to propose a method which enables development of V2P road safety applications via wireless communication and only utilizing the existing infrastructure and devices. As pedestrians' smartphones do not support the IEEE 802.11p amendment which is customized for vehicular networking, we have initiated an approach that utilizes cellular technologies. Study shows potential of utilizing 3G and LTE for highly mobile entities of vehicular network applications. In addition, some vehicles are already equipped with cellular connectivity but otherwise the driver's smartphone is used as an alternative. However, smartphone limited battery life is a bottleneck in realization of such pedestrian safety system. To tackle the energy limitation in smartphones, we employ an adaptive multi-level approach which operates in an energy-saving mode in risk-free situations but switches to normal mode as it detects a risky situation. Based on our evaluation and analysis, this adaptive approach considerably saves electrical energy and thus makes the cellular-based road-safety system practical.},

The information generated by mobile sensors (vehicles and cyclists) is sent over this heterogeneous communication architecture and processed in a central server, the Drivers Cloud, which is in charge of generating the messages that are shown on the drivers' and cyclists' Human Machine Interface (HMI). First of all, V-Alert has been tested in a simulated scenario to check the communications architecture in a complex scenario and, once it was validated, all the elements of V-Alert have been moved to a real scenario to check the application reliability.

  abstract = {While Twitter and other Online Social Networks (OSNs) or microblogs are considered as a source of information for breaking news or uproarious and unexpected events, they could also be exploited as a dense worldwide sensors network for physical measurements. The corpus of geotagged posts from OSNs includes people's feedbacks about a wide range of topics, with precise temporal and geographical metadata, that can be used as a support or an improvement to hardware sensors. For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area. Such a correlation can be exploited to integrate and extend existing air pollution monitoring networks. At the end of the manuscript we propose to further employ the time series of posts returned by the geosocial search to predict next pollution values.},

We build on previous work in this area [18, 8, 5, 11] with an extensive experimental analysis of protocol operation at a level of detail not previously explored. We report on data gathered with four capture devices from nearly 50 experimental runs conducted with vehicles on a rural highway. Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\% of overall throughput, 15\% of the time. (2) We quantify the effects of ten problems caused by the mechanics of existing protocols that are responsible for this throughput loss; and (3) We recommend best practices for using vehicular opportunistic connections. Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be significantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP. The central message in this paper is that wireless conditions in the vicinity of a roadside access point are predictable, and by exploiting this information, vehicular opportunistic access can be greatly improved.},

However, GPS errors sometimes impede map-matching algorithms in finding the correct segment, especially in dense and complicated parts of the network, such as near intersections with acute angles or on close parallel roads. In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is explored to improve the segment identification accuracy of map-matching algorithms. The proposed ANN is continuously trained by using the horizontal shift imposed on GPS points and once it is trained, it will be used to correct raw GPS points before inputting them into the map-matching algorithm. Integrating the proposed ANN enabled an existing map-matching algorithm to find the correct segments for some of the GPS points where the original map-matching algorithm had failed to do so.},

In this research we have proposed an infrastructure-less fog-based architecture where fog nodes process delay sensitive data obtained from smartphones for alerting pedestrians and drivers before sending the data to the cloud for further analysis. Fog computing is used in order to develop the architecture since it is an emerging paradigm that has paramount of advantages for low-latency applications which demand mobility support, geodistribution and location awareness. We have also defined an algorithm for accident prediction and alerting involving vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture is able to render alerts in real time whichever wireless communication (Wi-Fi or LTE) is used to connect smartphones with fog nodes. Moreover, analytical and performance evaluations depict that the new architecture outperforms other related architectures in terms of reliability, scalability and latency.},

In order to prevent collisions with vulnerable road users cars make use of collision avoidance systems. These systems are mainly based on camera, infrared and/or radar sensors and suffer from difficulties like road users hidden by cars and buildings. These collision prevention systems are mainly autonomous systems and are not cooperating with other detection systems. We propose to extend CALM, the communication standard for cooperative vehicular systems (16), with a local communication system for protection devices for vulnerable road users. These systems can be integrated into existing systems like bicycle navigation systems and/or smartphones. For devices which cannot rely on a navigation system we propose to use position estimation, based on the position of neighbouring devices, like parked cars, roadside units or smart devices.},

  abstract = {The UN Economic Commission's Statistics of Road Traffic Accidents report of 2011 shows that every year, about 150 000 human beings lose their lives on the roads of the western world. Although it is a common belief that this figure could shrink with the use of new sensor and communication technologies, unfortunately, none such systems have hit the road to date. Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we fill this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system specifically devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios. Our experiments confirm what has been observed before in theory and simulation, i.e., the use of such a system can reduce, by as much as 40\%, the amount of vehicles involved in highway pileups.},

The dual-rate EKF consists of a high-speed filter and a low-speed filter, the high-speed filter fuses data from Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS and INS, the low-speed filter fuses data from pseudorange GPS and INS. This solution designed to isolate the noise from pseudorange and realize the complementary of real-time performance and high precision. The solution yields exponential convergence of the attitude and position estimates. The implementation results show that the proposed method resolves an integer vector identical to that of the original method and achieves state estimation with centimeter global positioning accuracy.},

The derived ANN geoid heights are compared to those produced by a wellknown conventional method through a combined gravimetric geoid. In order to evaluate the computed heights, numerical tests were carried out for points distributed inside and at the borders of the study area.

  abstract = {Integrated inertial navigation system (INS) and global positioning system (GPS) units provide reliable navigation solution compared to standalone INS or GPS. Traditional Kalman filter-based INS/GPS integration schemes have several inadequacies related to sensor error model and immunity to noise. Alternatively, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks with three layers have been implemented to improve the position accuracy of the integrated system. However, MLP neural networks show poor accuracy for low-cost INS because of the large inherent sensor errors. For the first time the paper demonstrates the use of knowledge-based source difference artificial neural network (SDANN) to improve navigation performance of low-cost sensor, with or without external aiding sources. Unlike the conventional MLP or artificial neural networks (ANN), the structure of SDANN consists of two MLP neural networks called the coarse model and the difference model. The coarse model learns the input\textendash{}output data relationship whereas the difference model adds knowledge to the system and fine-tunes the coarse model output by learning the associated training or estimation error. Our proposed SDANN model illustrated a significant improvement in navigation accuracy of up to 81\% over conventional MLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDANN method is effective for GPS/INS integration schemes using low-cost inertial sensors, with and without GPS.},

  abstract = {Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) employed in civil missions are receiving remarkable attention from both research and industry. UAVs embed more and more sensor technology, and their small mounted cameras allow for efficient mapping of large areas in short time. Yet, civil missions such as rescue operations would need a timely delivery of high-resolution images, which calls for high-speed communication such as provided by WLAN IEEE 802.11n. Driven by extensive experiments, the key finding of this contribution is that 802.11n performs poorly in highly mobile and aerial scenarios, as the throughput between UAVs drops far below the theoretical maximum as soon as they become airborne. This is partially caused by the limitations of the embedded hardware, but also a result of the network dynamics of the aerial links. In order to dissect the origins of the low performance figures, we isolate the potential causes of degradation by analyzing our data of throughput, packet loss, aircraft and antenna orientation, and cruise speed. We discuss quantitatively how practical it is to deliver high-resolution images when being exposed to aerial throughput. We believe that it will be a long way until micro UAVs transferring large-size data become reality and argue for a new amendment of IEEE 802.11 addressing the communication among highly-mobile UAVs.},

  abstract = {Collision avoidance is one of the most difficult and challenging automatic driving operations in the domain of intelligent vehicles. In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers' behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to define the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed field tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Accurate vehicle tracking is essential for navigation systems to function correctly. Unfortunately, GPS data is still plagued with errors that frequently produce inaccurate trajectories. Research in map matching algorithms focuses on how to efficiently match GPS tracking data to the underlying road network. This article presents an innovative map matching algorithm that considers the trajectory of the data rather than merely the current position as in the typical map matching case. Instead of computing the precise angle which is traditionally used, a discrete eightdirection chain code, to represent a trend of movement, is used. Coupled with distance information, map matching decisions are made by comparing the differences between trajectories representing the road segments and GPS tracking data chain-codes. Moreover, to contrast the performance of the chain-code algorithm, two evaluation strategies, linear and non-linear, are analyzed. The presented chain-code map matching algorithm was evaluated for wheelchair navigation using university campus sidewalk data. The evaluation results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in terms of accuracy and computational time.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of Future Internet and will comprise many billions of Internet Connected Objects (ICO) or `things' where things can sense, communicate, compute and potentially actuate as well as have intelligence, multi-modal interfaces, physical/ virtual identities and attributes. Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments.

  abstract = {Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (cITS) are a promising technology to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.},

A reliable map-matching algorithm is an indispensable and integral part of any land-based navigation system/service. This paper reviews existing map-matching algorithms with the aim of highlighting their qualities as well as unfolding their unresolved issues as a means to provide directions for future studies in this field. Existing map-matching algorithms are compared and contrasted with respect to positioning sensors, map qualities, assumptions and accuracies. The results of these comparisons provide interesting insights into the workings of existing algorithms and the issues they must address for improving their performance. Example findings are: (a) not all map-matching algorithms pay sufficient attention to topology of networks, directionality of roads or turn-restrictions; (b) most map-matching algorithms make an unbalanced trade-off between performance and accuracy; and (c) weight-based map-matching algorithms balance simplicity and accuracy and advanced map-matching algorithms provide high accuracy but with low performance. Based on the findings, suggestions are made to improve existing algorithms.},

This is irrespective of the constraints of the operational environment, thus alleviating outage and accuracy problems associated with the use of stand-alone location sensors.

One of the key issues enabling future solutions is achieving an effective integration between mobile apps and vehicles. Such integration can be efficiently achieved on all existing vehicles by relying on the On Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) interface. This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.},

On the contrary, the smartphone industry is advancing quickly. Existing smartphones are endowed with multiple wireless interfaces and high computational power, being able to perform a wide variety of tasks. By combining smartphones with existing vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and services when driving. In this paper we propose an Androidbased application that monitors the vehicle through an On Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) interface, being able to detect accidents. Our proposed application estimates the G force experienced by the passengers in case of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to detect accidents. The application reacts to positive detection by sending details about the accident through either e-mail or SMS to pre-defined destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone call to the emergency services. Experimental results using a real vehicle show that the application is able to react to accident events in less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.},

The importance of pedestrian protection is emphasized in a global context, discussing the research programs and efforts in various countries. Pedestrian safety measures, including infrastructure enhancements and passive safety features in vehicles, are described, followed by a systematic description of active safety systems based on pedestrian detection using sensors in vehicle and infrastructure. The pedestrian detection approaches are classified according to various criteria such as the type and configuration of sensors, as well as the video cues and classifiers used in detection algorithms. It is noted that collision avoidance not only requires detection of pedestrians but also requires collision prediction using pedestrian dynamics and behavior analysis. Hence, this paper includes research dealing with probabilistic modeling of pedestrian behavior for predicting collisions between pedestrians and vehicles.},

Notwithstanding, the GPS accuracy still suffers from the errors afflicting the measurements, particularly the short-period displacement of structural components. Previously, the multi filter method is utilized to remove the displacement errors. This paper aims at using a novel application for the neural network prediction models to improve the GPS monitoring time series data. Four prediction models for the learning algorithms are applied and used with neural network solutions: back-propagation, Cascade-forward back-propagation, adaptive filter and extended Kalman filter, to estimate which model can be recommended. The noise simulation and bridge's short-period GPS of the monitoring displacement component of one Hz sampling frequency are used to validate the four models and the previous method. The results show that the Adaptive neural networks filter is suggested for de-noising the observations, specifically for the GPS displacement components of structures. Also, this model is expected to have significant influence on the design of structures in the low frequency responses and measurements' contents.},

  abstract = {Vehicular networks are inseparable components of a smart city environment due to several applications that improve life quality, safety and security. Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures. Moreover open issues and future directions are presented and discussed to help stimulate future studies in this emerging research field.},

Even though the comprehensive use of historical traffic data and assignment models to support the most part of online services and operations, real-time data is extremely important to promote models' accuracy and, therefore, the reliability of information and outputs derived from data fusion and processing. Together with techniques and theoretical formulas we present a case study applied to the Portuguese Brisa's A5 motorway, a 25 km inter-urban highway between Lisbon and Cascais. Traffic on this motorway heading to Lisbon in the morning rush hours typically experiences high levels of congestion.

In this paper, we propose an urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and hidden Markov models (HMM). Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac\- curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth\- ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip\- tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experiments for pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification are con\- ducted independently and both methods achieve nearly 90\% on classification.},

This foundation rests on the Wold decomposition theorem and on the assertion that a one-week lagged first seasonal difference applied to discrete interval traffic condition data will yield a weakly stationary transformation. Moreover, empirical results using actual intelligent transportation system data are presented and found to be consistent with the theoretical hypothesis. Conclusions are given on the implications of these assertions and findings relative to ongoing intelligent transportation systems research, deployment, and operations.},

Both from the point of view of network operators as well as from the point of view of travelers wishing real-time route guidance, accurate short-term traffic prediction is a necessary first step. While techniques for short-term traffic prediction have existed for some time, emerging smart transportation technologies require the traffic prediction capability to be both fast and scalable to full urban networks. We present a method that has proven to be able to meet this challenge. The method presented provides predictions of speed and volume over 5-min intervals for up to 1 h in advance.},

Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly use shallow traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.},

  abstract = {Vehicles provide an ideal platforms for a plethora of emerging applications such as networked gaming, multimedia content delivery and urban sensing. Cars have no power constraints and they can be instrumented with high end computational units and graphic devices. The deployment at scale of urban vehicular systems, however, requires a careful design able to consider challenges across several domains. Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our field experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA). We designed and built the components for a pollution monitoring system able to support closed-loop optimization between pollution and traffic management. Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban traffic. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-field experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.},

The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Pioneered by the Google car, the Internet of Vehicles will be a distributed transport fabric capable to make its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g., the smart building), the Internet of Vehicles will have communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers' intentions. The concept that will help transition to the Internet of Vehicles is the Vehicular Cloud, the equivalent of Internet cloud for vehicles, providing all the services required by the autonomous vehicles.

Urban planners are looking for solutions to reduce traffic congestion. Realtime traffic information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and traffic control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.},

Ubiquitous sensing poses numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an overview of the state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical challenges associated with these technologies. In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies play a role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated with these applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies belong to different disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts to bridge these to provide a broad overview, which can be of help to researchers and developers in understanding how advanced sensing can play a role in smart cities.},

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},

  abstract = {Decentralization, in the form mesh networking and blockchain, two promising technologies, is coming to the telecommunications industry. Mesh networking allows wider low cost Internet access while blockchain enables complete transparency and accountability for investments and revenue or other forms of economic compensations from sharing of network traffic, content and services. Crowdsourcing network coverage combined with crowdfunding costs can create sustainable yet decentralized Internet access infrastructures, where every participant can invest in resources, and pay and be paid for usage. While mesh networks and mesh routing protocols enable self-organized networks that expand organically, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts enable the economic coordination among network providers and consumers. We explore and evaluate two existing blockchain software stacks, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) and Ethereum geth with Proof of Authority (PoA), deployed in a real citywide production mesh network, and in a centralized laboratory network. We quantify the performance, bottlenecks and identify the current limitations and opportunities for improvement to serve the needs of wireless mesh networks.},

This mechanism ensures transaction integrity disclosing transaction information transparently. Therefore, it is emerging as the core technology of the 4th industrial revolution by improving reliability and efficiency with features of decentralization, ensuring the integrity, and economic cost reduction. However, there are some problems with the growth of the blockchain. The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction. This has the disadvantage that the system doesn't operate without compensation. Also, the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Algorithm using private blockchain has a limited number of acceptable malicious users. In this case, if the users collude with malicious and exceed the limited number, the transaction is rejected. In this paper, we propose a Smart Manager System and RMBC-DBFT (Randomized Mesh Blockchain Diversity of opinion BFT) enables the safe transaction to the problems above.},

This causes difficulties in areas with poor Internet access, such as remote rural areas, or challenging radio environments, for example in metropolitan areas, as the LoRa gateway must be placed at a location with backhaul access to the network server, but must nonetheless be reachable by all end devices. To facilitate these applications, we present a new routing protocol to enable mesh networking with LoRa, allowing for multihop networking between gateways to extend coverage. Our protocol is tailored specifically to the requirements of LoRa networks. We have developed a proof-of-concept implementation of the protocol and have shown its effectiveness in both laboratory tests and a field trial in a real-world LoRa deployment.},

It is primarily designed for large used car dealerships. Cars to be tracked are fitted with batterypowered tags that send each other plain LoRa messages and then report over LoRaWAN the observed RSSI to the server. The server estimates tag coordinates using multi-dimensional scaling and a novel corrective transformation based on tag clustering. We designed a low-cost tag for RSSI measurement and an energy efficient solution for managing a mesh of 1000 tags on one site using time division multiplexing. The tags are fully controlled and synchronized by the server. To stay synchronized for several hours until a next downlink the tags estimate and compensate the real-time clock error. Large-scale tests are yet to be performed, but lab-based and small-scale tests in real conditions show a maximal error of 8 meters and a battery lifetime of 5 years.},

Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals. The results show our LoRa mesh networking module achieved a 88.49\% packet delivery ratio (PDR), while the LoRaWAN in starnetwork topology was only 58.7\% under the same conditions.},

This flexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.},

  abstract = {By 2020, 50 billion devices (things) are expected to be connected to the Internet to form the Internet of Things (IoT) world. In general, two main categories of networks are used in the IoT: short-range and long-range low-power networks. IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities. Each network category has its unique characteristics and strengths and each category has its important role in the IoT world.},

This paper explains the motivation behind the integration of these two techniques, and highlights certain scenarios in which the joint approach may even degrade the performance, emphasizing the fact that their synergistic effect cannot be accomplished with a naive and perfunctory combination. This survey paper also provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the joint protocols in terms of their fundamental components and associated challenges, and compares existing joint protocols.

With the advantage of distributed architecture and close to end-users, fog/edge computing can provide faster response and greater quality of service for IoT applications. Thus, fog/edge computing-based IoT becomes future infrastructure on IoT development. To develop fog/edge computing-based IoT infrastructure, the architecture, enabling techniques, and issues related to IoT should be investigated first, and then the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT should be explored. To this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive overview of IoT with respect to system architecture, enabling technologies, security and privacy issues, and present the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT, and applications. Particularly, this paper first explores the relationship between cyber-physical systems and IoT, both of which play important roles in realizing an intelligent cyber-physical world. Then, existing architectures, enabling technologies, and security and privacy issues in IoT are presented to enhance the understanding of the state of the art IoT development. To investigate the fog/edge computing-based IoT, this paper also investigate the relationship between IoT and fog/edge computing, and discuss issues in fog/edge computing-based IoT. Finally, several applications, including the smart grid, smart transportation, and smart cities, are presented to demonstrate how fog/edge computing-based IoT to be implemented in real-world applications.},

Research has shown a substantial development of solutions for a wide range of devices and IoT platforms over the past 6-7 years. However, each solution provides its own IoT infrastructure, devices, APIs, and data formats leading to interoperability issues. Such interoperability issues are the consequence of many critical issues such as vendor lock-in, impossibility to develop IoT application exposing cross-platform, and/or cross-domain, difficulty in plugging non-interoperable IoT devices into different IoT platforms, and ultimately prevents the emergence of IoT technology at a large-scale. To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together. This paper performs a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IoT platforms. Also, the key challenges in this topic is presented.},

  abstract = {In the near future, all our everyday things and objects will be both connected to the Internet and equipped with enough sensing, acting and processing capabilities to exploit the full potential benefits of the so called Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Even the simplest objects will become ``smart'' because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},

In this model, many security risks of traditional IoT architectures can be avoided, and system performance is significantly improved in distributed large capacity storage, concurrency and query. Secondly, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated through the average latency and throughput, which are meaningful for further research and optimization of this direction.

  doi = {10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538551},
  abstract = {With numerous emerging internet of things (IoT) devices, they generate big data. The big data transmitted to the cloud or fog will consume massive network bandwidth. This may result in the IoT network easily encountering network congestion. Moreover, there are IoT applications that need to transfer multimedia data with multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements. A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed. The AQRA improves the average end-to-end flow performance by 10.75\%, 11.88\% and 10.82\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. The AQRA improves the standard deviation of end-to-end flow performance by 14.37\%, 17.95\% and 14.28\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. In addition, the runtime of the AQRA is 38.56\% shorter than that of MINA.},

Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed.

  abstract = {As a result of the development of internet and ICT (information-centric technology) advances including mobile, cloud, social networking, big data, multimedia and the tendency towards digital society, the management and configuration of them have become highly complex, challenging and time consuming. Also, access to high bandwidth, extendibility and dynamic management are of critical significance, especially when network devices are vertically integrated. Hence, a set of unique predefined line commands and operating systems or firmware should be used. SDN (software-defined networking) is a structure designed for simplifying and improving network management with high flexibility by splitting control plane and data plane. Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities. Although SDN is regarded as a new research issue, it has attracted numerous researchers' attention from both industrial and academic institutes. In this paper, data plane, control plane and application plane as the three planes of SDN and the interfaces between them such as OpenFlow are investigated and the challenges and the latest technologies in relation to SDN are examined. The investigation and overview of SDN reported in this paper might be used by the interested future researchers to better understand and apply SDN in real-life applications.},

  abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN) brings about innovation, simplicity in network management, and configuration in network computing. Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, thus moving the control logic from the node to a central controller. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature. Moreover, it delves into some of the challenges facing this paradigm, as well as the major SDWSN design requirements that need to be considered to address these challenges.},

The problem consists in the selection of the most suitable from all radio access technologies available. The decision process is called network selection, and depends on several parameters, such as quality of service, mobility, cost, energy, battery life, etc. Several methods and approaches have been proposed in this context, with their objective being to offer the best QoS to the users, and/or to maximize re-usability of the networks. This paper represents a survey of the network selection methods used. Multiple attribute-dependent decision-making methods are presented. Furthermore, the game theory concept is illustrated, the use of the fuzzy logic is presented, and the utility functions defining the network selection process are discussed.},

In fact, a large number of devices may attempt simultaneously to access the base station, which may result in severe congestions at the random-access channel (RACH) level. To alleviate such congestion while regulating the M2M devices' opportunities to transmit, the Access Class Barring (ACB) process was proposed. In this article, we propose a novel implementation of the ACB mechanism in the context of multiple M2M traffic classes. Based on a scheduling algorithm, we have applied a PID controller to adjust dynamically multiple ACB factors related to each class category, guaranteeing a number of devices around an optimal value that maximizes the Random Access (RA) success probability. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism by increasing the success probability and minimizing radio resources' underutilization with respect to each class priority.},

  abstract = {The next mobile generation is planned to create a networked society, in which Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications are expected to play a key role in a plethora of domains and applications. The massive deployment of such devices may overwhelm the cellular network by imposing strong constraints on the Radio Access Network (RAN) because of the radio resources' scarcity. As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would efficiently help to overcome the risk of congestion. In this paper, we proposed a novel fluid model for M2M communications, which allows gaining an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of such systems. The provided analysis of the model was used to devise a new method to estimate accurately the number of M2M devices willing to connect as well as the number of random access attempts.We proposed, then, a novel implementation of the ACB process, which dynamically computes the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions while includes a corrective action adapting the controller action based on the mismatch existing between the computed and the targeted mean load. Compared to existing approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms allow improving considerably the estimation of the number of M2M devices' arrivals, while outperforming existing techniques in terms of the number of abandons, the success and the collision probabilities, and the average access delay.},

This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion. One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances. Thus, we proposed, in this paper, a new method to estimate accurately the number of random access attempts in a way to measure efficiently the congestion level. Then, we proposed a novel implementation of the ACB process that mainly consists of dynamically adapting the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions by improving significantly the access's success probability while minimizing radio resources' underutilization.

One of the most difficult challenges to support M2M communications is their huge number compared to available radio resources. Hence, to deal with random access channel (RACH) overload and to better control the access in LTE-A Networks, the 3GPP proposed the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor concept. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve this method based on adaptive multiple ACB factors, according to M2M traffic category with respect to their access delay budget and drop rate (QoS parameters). Simulations were done for testing the effectiveness of our MACB scheme and show that using multiples ACB factors and dynamically adjusting them to the congestion level in addition to traffic type category increases the access probability and reduces overload. The obtained results were then compared to the basic ACB method and show that the access probability increases especially for high priority traffic.},

[2, 3] La qualit\'e de service d'application IoT d\'epend non seulement du r\'eseau Internet et de l'infrastructure de communication, mais aussi du fonctionnement et des performances des appareils IoT. Par cons\'equent, les nouveaux param\`etres de QoS tels que la pr\'ecision des donn\'ees et la disponibilit\'e des appareils deviennent importants pour les applications IoT par rapport aux applications Internet. Le grand nombre de dispositifs et d'applications IoT connect\'es \`a Internet, et le flux de

D'un autre c\^ot\'e, les dispositifs non-IP et leurs capacit\'es limit\'ees en termes d'\'energie et de transmission cr\'eent l'environnement dynamique et contraint. De plus, l'interconnexion de bout en bout entre les dispositifs et les applications n'est pas possible. Aussi, les applications sont int\'eress\'ees par les donn\'ees collect\'ees, pas \`a la source sp\'ecifique qui les produit. Le Software Defined Networking (SDN) est un nouveau paradigme pour les r\'eseaux informatiques apparu r\'ecemment pour cacher la complexit\'e de l'architecture de r\'eseau traditionnelle (par exemple de l'Internet) et briser la fermeture des syst\`emes de r\'eseau dans les fonctions de contr\^ole et de donn\'ees.

Nous pr\'esentons un intergiciel bas\'e sur SDN pour d\'efinir un cadre de gestion de QoS pour g\'erer les besoins sp\'ecifiques de chaque application \`a travers l'infrastructure IoT.

The IoT vision is to extend the Internet into our everyday lives, so the number of connected devices and innovative applications are growing very fast to bring intelligence into
as many domains as possible. The QoS for IoT application not only depends on the Internet network and communication
infrastructure, it is also impacted by the operation and performance of IoT sensing infrastructure. Therefore, the new QoS parameters such as data accuracy, sampling rate, and
device availability become important for the IoT applications compared to the Internet applications. The huge number of the Internet-connected IoT devices and application, and the spontaneous traffic flow among them make the management of the quality of service complex
across the Internet infrastructure. On the other hand, the non-IP devices and their limited capabilities in terms of energy and transmission create the dynamic environment and hinder the direct interaction between devices and applications. The quality of service is becoming one of the critical non-functional IoT element which needs research and studies. A flexible and scalable QoS management mechanism must be implemented in IoT system to keep up with the growth rate of the Internet-connected IoT devices and applications as well as their heterogeneity and diversity. The solution should address the IoT application requirements and user satisfaction while considering the system dynamism, limitations, and characteristics. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networking which separates the control plane and the data plane of the network elements. It makes the network
elements programmable via the centralized control plane. This approach enables more agile management and control over the network behavior. In this thesis, we take advantage of SDN technology as the future of the Internet to offer a
flexible and adaptive QoS support scheme for the IoT services. We present an SDN-based middleware to define a QoS management framework to manage the application specific QoS
needs across the IoT infrastructure including transport and sensing network. Also, we propose a new QoS model that takes into account the application QoS preferences and the network
elements status to allocate effectively the resources for the applications across SDN network while maximizing network performance.},

  abstract = {Network selection receives considerable attention from communication networks researchers. This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the offered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of e ciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for different multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of different parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study. In the first part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user's preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario. We also improve the latter solution by proposing a network selection algorithm that provides a load balancing technique based on matching game theory to overcome network overload conditions in high-speed scenarios. In the second part, the performance study has been evaluated for two scenario types: Cellular and Vehicular. The proposed algorithms were evaluated and validated in both mobile and vehicular environments using the NS3 simulator.},

This paper tackles the access technology selection \textemdash{} a key CRRM functionality \textemdash{} and proposes a hybrid approach that combines benefits from both network-centric and user-centric methods. Network information, that is periodically broadcasted, assists mobile users in their decisions. By broadcasting appropriate decisional information, the network tries to globally control users decision in a way to meet operator objectives. On the other hand, mobiles also integrate their needs and preferences to select their access technology so as to maximize their own utility. In comparison with other RAT selection techniques, including network-centric, hybrid and user-centric methods, simulation results prove the efficiency of our hybrid approach in enhancing resource utilization and maximizing user satisfaction.},

  abstract = {We present a complete simulation and experimentation framework for IEEE 802.11p. The core of the framework is an SDR-based OFDM transceiver that we validated extensively by means of simulations, interoperability tests, and, ultimately, by conducting a field test. Being SDR-based, the transceiver offers important benefits: It provides access to all data down to and including the physical layer, allowing for a better understanding of the system. Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modified. Finally, it enables a seamless switch between simulations and experiments and, thus, helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Comparing the transceiver's performance with independent results from simulations and experiments, we underline its potential to be used as a tool for further studies of IEEE 802.11p networks both in field operational tests as well as for simulation-based development of novel physical layer solutions. To make the framework accessible to fellow researchers and to allow reproduction of the results, we released it under an Open Source license.},

Consequently, a considerable number of applications never seen before is emerging to make daily lifestyle more practical and connected through sharing, storing and processing personal data. When applied to industry, the same technologies can cause a real revolution in the manner how the information is treated. The value of the processed data is increasing fast and point to the fourth industrial revolution, or industry 4.0. This paper evaluates the performance of two ICT (Information and Communication Technology) protocols coming from the consumer world with an enormous potential to be used by industry. Experiments were performed to measure the round trip time using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and WebSocket protocols with the exchange of data between one server in Italy and another in Brazil. The results can be analyzed for each possible application and different network paths. The average latency samples using each of the protocols were similar, defining the payload size of the requests, but changing according to the way.},

The main reason is due to the existence of white spots. The lack of communication between breeders does not allow the dissemination of vital information such as water points location, bush fires geographic location, epidemic area, and available pastureland. However, in undeserved areas, satellite communications are very expensive for rural population. Therefore, we propose a lowcost communication based on LoRa transmission that enables different services like short message text, voice messages, status of a water points, geographic location. The deployed architecture is a delay tolerant ad-hoc network that can cover a large area with a mesh system.},

  abstract = {Recently, various types of services belonging to different domains intertwine together and constitute the Big Service. In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users' complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufficient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great influences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper first defines the SFSD and describes the important influences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},

  abstract = {The fundamental properties of long-range (LoRa) performance have been revealed by previous research, but advanced issues remain unresolved. This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance. Last, the application parameters required by the smart energy scenario influence LoRa performance, but their impacts have been scarcely reported. Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that considers performance issues when establishing a LoRa network on a real-world application testbed.},

Smart devices are composed of several components including sensors, boards, batteries, processing units, and antennas. However, the form and size of the smart devices are usually limited due to antenna restrictions. In this paper, we propose the architecture of a compact low-cost LoRa smart device designed for easy deployment in smart building applications. The proposed device architecture features a reduced size embedded antenna and an ultra-low-power microcontroller to interface several sensors and actuators. The results obtained have shown that the proposed design can be used for communication, between two compact LoRa devices, in line-of-sight for up to 4.2 km, in urban environments for up to 1.2 km and also for in-building communications for up to 152 m, without compromising the low-power features that LoRa supports.},

The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa configuration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the traffic intensity. The comparison shows the benefits of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its configuration according to its link budget.},

  abstract = {Low-power and long-range communication technologies such as LoRa are becoming popular in IoT applications due to their ability to cover kilometers range with milliwatt of power consumption. One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the traffic congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa. Experimental results show a data reliability of 100 \% and a round-trip latency on the order of milliseconds with end devices dissipating less than 46 mJ when active and 1.83 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}W during periods of inactivity, lasting up to 3 years on a 1200 mA h Lithium battery.},

This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative study of these technologies, which serve as efficient solutions to connect smart, autonomous, and heterogeneous devices. We show that Sigfox and LoRa are advantageous in terms of battery lifetime, capacity, and cost. Meanwhile, NB-IoT offers benefits in terms of latency and quality of service. In addition, we analyze the IoT success factors of these LPWAN technologies, and we consider application scenarios and explain which technology is the best fit for each of these scenarios.},

  abstract = {New transceiver technologies have emerged which enable power efficient communication over very long distances. Examples of such Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN)technologies are LoRa, Sigfox and Weightless. A typicalapplication scenario for these technologies is city wide meter reading collection where devices send readings at very low frequency over a long distance to a data concentrator (one-hop networks). We argue that these transceiversare potentially very useful to construct more generic Internet of Things (IoT) networks incorporating multi-hop bi-directional communication enabling sensing and actuation. Furthermore, these transceivers have interesting features notavailable with more traditional transceivers used for IoT networks which enable construction of novel protocol elements. In this paper we present a performance and capabilityanalysis of a currently available LoRa transceiver. We describe its features and then demonstrate how such transceivercan be put to use efficiently in a wide-area application scenario. In particular we demonstrate how unique featuressuch as concurrent non-destructive transmissions and carrier detection can be employed. Our deployment experiment demonstrates that 6 LoRa nodes can form a network covering 1.5 ha in a built up environment, achieving a potential lifetime of 2 year on 2 AA batteries and delivering data within 5 s and reliability of 80\%.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a low-power long-range IoT standard that uses the chirp spread spectrum technique, and we have strived to further extend its coverage by utilizing the direct device-to-device (D2D) links to construct a multi-hop relay network. In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches. We additionally deploy a real-chip experiment to evaluate the feasibility of parallel transmission in practice.},

The measurements were executed for cases when a node located on ground (attached on the roof rack of a car) or on water (attached to the radio mast of a boat) reporting their data to a base station. For a node operating in the 868 MHz ISM band using 14 dBm transmit power and the maximum spreading factor, we have observed the maximum communication range of over 15 km on ground and close to 30 km on water. Besides the actual measurements, in the paper we also present a channel attenuation model derived from the measurement data. The model can be used to estimate the path loss in 868 MHz ISM band in an area similar to Oulu, Finland.},

  shorttitle = {Signal-to-{{Interference}}-plus-{{Noise Ratio Estimation}} for {{Wireless Communication Systems}}},
  abstract = {The Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) is an important metric of wireless communication link quality. SINR estimates have several important applications. These include optimizing the transmit power level for a target quality of service, assisting with handoff decisions and dynamically adapting the data rate for wireless Internet applications. Accurate SINR estimation provides for both a more efficient system and a higher user-perceived quality of service. In this paper, we develop new SINR estimators and compare their mean squared error (MSE) performance. We show that our new estimators dominate estimators that have previously appeared in the literature with respect to MSE. The sequence of transmitted bits in wireless communication systems consists of both pilot bits (which are known both to the transmitter and receiver) and user bits (which are known only by the transmitter). The SINR estimators we consider alternatively depend exclusively on pilot bits, exclusively on user bits, or simultaneously use both pilot and user bits. In addition, we consider estimators that utilize smoothing and feedback mechanisms. Smoothed estimators are motivated by the fact that the interference component of the SINR changes relatively slowly with time, typically with the addition or departure of a user to the system. Feedback estimators are motivated by the fact that receivers typically decode bits correctly with a very high probability, and therefore user bits can be thought of as quasipilot bits. For each estimator discussed, we derive an exact or approximate formula for its MSE. Satterthwaite approximations, noncentral F distributions (singly and doubly) and distribution theory of quadratic forms are the key statistical tools used in developing the MSE formulas. In the case of approximate MSE formulas, we validate their accuracy using simulation techniques. The approximate MSE formulas, of interest in their own right for comparing the quality of the estimators, are also used for optimally combining estimators. In particular, we derive optimal weights for linearly combining an estimator based on pilot bits with an estimator based on user bits. The optimal weights depend on the MSE of the two estimators being combined, and thus the accurate approximate MSE formulas can conveniently be used. The optimal weights also depend on the unknown SINR, and therefore need to be estimated in order to construct a useable combined estimator. The impact on the MSE of the combined estimator due to estimating the weights is examined. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 51: 720\textendash{}740, 2004.

This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the confidence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability). We provide a model-based and a model-free variants of the elimination method. We further derive stopping conditions guaranteeing that the learned policy is approximately optimal with high probability.

For the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the sequence of rewards is chosen by an oblivious adversary, the notion of best arm during the time horizon is too restrictive for applications such as ad-serving, where the best ad could change during time range. In this paper, we consider a variant of the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the time horizon is divided into unknown time periods within which rewards are drawn from stochastic distributions. During each time period, there is an optimal arm which may be different from the optimal arm at the previous time period. We present an algorithm taking advantage of the constant exploration of EXP3 to detect when the best arm changes. Its analysis shows that on a run divided into N periods where the best arm changes, the proposed algorithms achieves a regret in O(N {$\surd$}T log T).},

  abstract = {Path loss is the degradation in received power of an electromagnetic signal when it propagates through space. Path loss is due to several effects such as free space path loss, refraction, diffraction, reflection, coupling and cable loss, and absorption. Path loss depends on several factors such as type of propagations, environments, distance between the transmitter and receiver, height and location of antennas. Also, the signal from the transmitting antenna may take multiple paths (multipath) to reach the receiving side, which results in either increase or decrease of received signal level depending on the constructive or destructive interference of the multipath waves [1].},

  title = {Stochastic {{Multi}}-{{Armed}}-{{Bandit Problem}} with {{Non}}-Stationary {{Rewards}}},
  abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem a gambler needs to choose at each round of play one of K arms, each characterized by an unknown reward distribution. Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler's objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T . To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T . This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward ``variation'' and the minimal achievable regret, and by establishing a connection between the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},

  title = {Path Loss Validation for Urban Micro Cell Scenarios at 3.5 {{GHz}} Compared to 1.9 {{GHz}}},
  doi = {10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831689},
  abstract = {The 3.5 GHz band is a strong candidate for future urban micro cell deployment with base station antennas located below rooftop. Compared to other frequency bands, propagation in the 3.5 GHz band is relatively unexplored for the micro cell deployment. This paper presents a measurement-based analysis of outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor propagation at 3.5 GHz in comparison to the more well-known frequency of 1.9 GHz. A simple two-slope line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight outdoor path loss model is proposed and compared to different existing path loss models. The outdoor path loss is found to be approximately 5 dB higher for 3.5 GHz compared to 1.9 GHz. The outdoor-to-indoor propagation is investigated for two office buildings and different street shops. For the different presented scenarios, penetration loss increases with frequency and is found to be up to 5 dB higher for 3.5 GHz compared with 1.9 GHz. Although some existing models predict the observations with good accuracy, we propose a model based on line-of-sight probability that is simpler and easier to apply.},

  doi = {10.1007/s41060-017-0050-5},
  abstract = {We consider a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit with K arms where the rewards are not assumed to be identically distributed, but are generated by a non-stationary stochastic process. We first study the unique best arm setting when there exists one unique best arm. Second, we study the general switching best arm setting when a best arm switches at some unknown steps. For both settings, we target problem-dependent bounds, instead of the more conservative problem-free bounds. We consider two classical problems: (1) identify a best arm with high probability (best arm identification), for which the performance measure by the sample complexity (number of samples before finding a near-optimal arm). To this end, we naturally extend the definition of sample complexity so that it makes sense in the switching best arm setting, which may be of independent interest. (2) Achieve the smallest cumulative regret (regret minimization) where the regret is measured with respect to the strategy pulling an arm with the best instantaneous mean at each step.},
