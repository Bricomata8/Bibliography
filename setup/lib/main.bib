  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication presents a new paradigm in mobile networking to facilitate data exchange between physically proximate devices. The development of D2D is driven by mobile operators to harvest short range communications for improving network performance and supporting proximity-based services. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental and interrelated aspects of D2D communication, security and privacy, which are essential for the adoption and deployment of D2D. We present an extensive review of the state-of-the-art solutions for enhancing security and privacy in D2D communication. By summarizing the challenges, requirements, and features of different proposals, we identify lessons to be learned from existing studies and derive a set of ``best practices.'' The primary goal of our work is to equip researchers and developers with a better understanding of the underlying problems and the potential solutions for D2D security and privacy. To inspire follow-up research, we identify open problems and highlight future directions with regard to system and communication design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review to address the fundamental security and privacy issues in D2D communication.},

  abstract = {As the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth, it is no surprise that many recent cyber attacks are IoT-enabled: The attacker initially exploits some vulnerable IoT technology as a first step towards compromising a critical system that is connected, in some way, with the IoT. For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},

This paper presents a novel algorithm which considers QoS, devices locations and service relevance metrics and creates more appropriate clusters for the networked IoT objects in order to improve IoT services quality. Objects are then attached to gateways or relay devices with better network quality, while the performance of poorly operating clusters is also improved.},

These attacks can easily be accomplished by an adversary by either bypassing MAC-layer protocols or emitting a radio signal targeted at jamming a particular channel. In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.},

Our original approach, called Red Swarm, suggests a potentially customized route to each vehicle by using several spots located at traffic lights in order to avoid traffic jams by using V2I communications. That is quite different from other existing proposals, as it deals with real maps and actual streets, as well as several road traffic distributions. We propose an evolutionary algorithm (later efficiently parallelized) to optimize our case studies which have been imported from OpenStreetMap into SUMO as they belong to a real city. We have also developed a Rerouting Algorithm which accesses the configuration of the Red Swarm and communicates the route chosen to vehicles, using the spots (via WiFi link). Moreover, we have developed three competing algorithms in order to compare their results to those of Red Swarm and have observed that Red Swarm not only achieved the best results, but also outperformed the experts' solutions in a total of 60 scenarios tested, with up to 19\% shorter travel times.},

The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

Autonomous vehicles are today considered as a promising approach to deal with traffic control. In this paper, we propose a synchronization-based intersection control mechanism to allow the autonomous vehicle-agents to cross without stopping, i.e., in order to avoid congestions (delays) and energy loss. We decentralize the problem by managing the traffic of each intersection independently from others. We define control agents which are able to synchronize the multiple flows of vehicles in each intersection, by alternating vehicles from both directions. We present experimental results in simulation, which allow to evaluate the approach and to compare it with a traffic light strategy. These results show the important gain in terms of time and energy at an intersection and in a network.},

In addition, the applications of the STPN to eight-phase, six-phase, and two-phase traffic-light control systems are modularized. The advantage of the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the behaviors of traffic lights in terms of the conditions and events that cause phase alternations. Moreover, the size of the urban traffic network control system can be easily extended with our proposed modular technique. An analysis of the control models is performed via a reachability graph method to demonstrate how the models enforce the transitions of the traffic lights.},

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},

Wireless communications have potential to support road safety by enabling road users to exchange information. In contrast to vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications for avoidance of inter-vehicle collisions, very limited efforts are made on communication mechanisms for pedestrian safety. This paper addresses the issue in a concrete way. We first formulate the requirement of the minimum information exchange distance for providing road users to have the necessary amount of time to perceive the situation and react. We then report our field tests and measurement based analysis to investigate if a Wi-Fi system can satisfy the application requirement. We also introduce a pedestrian protection application, V2ProVu, which provides the functionalities of the Wi-Fi communications, risk calculation, and hazard alarming. Our study discloses several useful insights including 1) information exchange for a velocity of 80 km/h has to be made before vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) distance is below 72 meters and 2) while this requirement is not too hard for radio communications technologies, the V2P communication range is greatly reduced if the signal is blocked by a human body.},

In addition, some vehicles are already equipped with cellular connectivity but otherwise the driver's smartphone is used as an alternative. However, smartphone limited battery life is a bottleneck in realization of such pedestrian safety system. To tackle the energy limitation in smartphones, we employ an adaptive multi-level approach which operates in an energy-saving mode in risk-free situations but switches to normal mode as it detects a risky situation. Based on our evaluation and analysis, this adaptive approach considerably saves electrical energy and thus makes the cellular-based road-safety system practical.},

The information generated by mobile sensors (vehicles and cyclists) is sent over this heterogeneous communication architecture and processed in a central server, the Drivers Cloud, which is in charge of generating the messages that are shown on the drivers' and cyclists' Human Machine Interface (HMI).

  abstract = {While Twitter and other Online Social Networks (OSNs) or microblogs are considered as a source of information for breaking news or uproarious and unexpected events, they could also be exploited as a dense worldwide sensors network for physical measurements. The corpus of geotagged posts from OSNs includes people's feedbacks about a wide range of topics, with precise temporal and geographical metadata, that can be used as a support or an improvement to hardware sensors. For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area. Such a correlation can be exploited to integrate and extend existing air pollution monitoring networks. At the end of the manuscript we propose to further employ the time series of posts returned by the geosocial search to predict next pollution values.},

However, GPS errors sometimes impede map-matching algorithms in finding the correct segment, especially in dense and complicated parts of the network, such as near intersections with acute angles or on close parallel roads. In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is explored to improve the segment identification accuracy of map-matching algorithms. The proposed ANN is continuously trained by using the horizontal shift imposed on GPS points and once it is trained, it will be used to correct raw GPS points before inputting them into the map-matching algorithm. Integrating the proposed ANN enabled an existing map-matching algorithm to find the correct segments for some of the GPS points where the original map-matching algorithm had failed to do so.},

In order to alleviate the problem, we can use sensing capabilities of mobile smartphones to detect, warn and safeguard VRUs. In this research we have proposed an infrastructure-less fog-based architecture where fog nodes process delay sensitive data obtained from smartphones for alerting pedestrians and drivers before sending the data to the cloud for further analysis. Fog computing is used in order to develop the architecture since it is an emerging paradigm that has paramount of advantages for low-latency applications which demand mobility support, geodistribution and location awareness. We have also defined an algorithm for accident prediction and alerting involving vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture is able to render alerts in real time whichever wireless communication (Wi-Fi or LTE) is used to connect smartphones with fog nodes. Moreover, analytical and performance evaluations depict that the new architecture outperforms other related architectures in terms of reliability, scalability and latency.},

In order to prevent collisions with vulnerable road users cars make use of collision avoidance systems. These systems are mainly based on camera, infrared and/or radar sensors and suffer from difficulties like road users hidden by cars and buildings. These collision prevention systems are mainly autonomous systems and are not cooperating with other detection systems. We propose to extend CALM, the communication standard for cooperative vehicular systems (16), with a local communication system for protection devices for vulnerable road users. These systems can be integrated into existing systems like bicycle navigation systems and/or smartphones. For devices which cannot rely on a navigation system we propose to use position estimation, based on the position of neighbouring devices, like parked cars, roadside units or smart devices.},

Although it is a common belief that this figure could shrink with the use of new sensor and communication technologies, unfortunately, none such systems have hit the road to date. Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we fill this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system specifically devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios. Our experiments confirm what has been observed before in theory and simulation, i.e., the use of such a system can reduce, by as much as 40\%, the amount of vehicles involved in highway pileups.},

  abstract = {Integrated inertial navigation system (INS) and global positioning system (GPS) units provide reliable navigation solution compared to standalone INS or GPS. Traditional Kalman filter-based INS/GPS integration schemes have several inadequacies related to sensor error model and immunity to noise. Alternatively, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks with three layers have been implemented to improve the position accuracy of the integrated system. However, MLP neural networks show poor accuracy for low-cost INS because of the large inherent sensor errors. For the first time the paper demonstrates the use of knowledge-based source difference artificial neural network (SDANN) to improve navigation performance of low-cost sensor, with or without external aiding sources. Unlike the conventional MLP or artificial neural networks (ANN), the structure of SDANN consists of two MLP neural networks called the coarse model and the difference model. The coarse model learns the input\textendash{}output data relationship whereas the difference model adds knowledge to the system and fine-tunes the coarse model output by learning the associated training or estimation error. Our proposed SDANN model illustrated a significant improvement in navigation accuracy of up to 81\% over conventional MLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDANN method is effective for GPS/INS integration schemes using low-cost inertial sensors, with and without GPS.},

  abstract = {Collision avoidance is one of the most difficult and challenging automatic driving operations in the domain of intelligent vehicles. In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers' behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to define the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed field tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Accurate vehicle tracking is essential for navigation systems to function correctly. Unfortunately, GPS data is still plagued with errors that frequently produce inaccurate trajectories. Research in map matching algorithms focuses on how to efficiently match GPS tracking data to the underlying road network. This article presents an innovative map matching algorithm that considers the trajectory of the data rather than merely the current position as in the typical map matching case. Instead of computing the precise angle which is traditionally used, a discrete eightdirection chain code, to represent a trend of movement, is used. Coupled with distance information, map matching decisions are made by comparing the differences between trajectories representing the road segments and GPS tracking data chain-codes. Moreover, to contrast the performance of the chain-code algorithm, two evaluation strategies, linear and non-linear, are analyzed. The presented chain-code map matching algorithm was evaluated for wheelchair navigation using university campus sidewalk data. The evaluation results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in terms of accuracy and computational time.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of Future Internet and will comprise many billions of Internet Connected Objects (ICO) or `things' where things can sense, communicate, compute and potentially actuate as well as have intelligence, multi-modal interfaces, physical/ virtual identities and attributes. Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments.

  abstract = {Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (cITS) are a promising technology to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.},

The results of these comparisons provide interesting insights into the workings of existing algorithms and the issues they must address for improving their performance. Example findings are: (a) not all map-matching algorithms pay sufficient attention to topology of networks, directionality of roads or turn-restrictions; (b) most map-matching algorithms make an unbalanced trade-off between performance and accuracy; and (c) weight-based map-matching algorithms balance simplicity and accuracy and advanced map-matching algorithms provide high accuracy but with low performance.

One of the key issues enabling future solutions is achieving an effective integration between mobile apps and vehicles. Such integration can be efficiently achieved on all existing vehicles by relying on the On Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) interface. This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.},

  abstract = {The increasing activity in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) area faces a strong limitation: the slow pace at which the automotive industry is making cars "smarter". On the contrary, the smartphone industry is advancing quickly. Existing smartphones are endowed with multiple wireless interfaces and high computational power, being able to perform a wide variety of tasks. By combining smartphones with existing vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and services when driving. In this paper we propose an Androidbased application that monitors the vehicle through an On Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) interface, being able to detect accidents. Our proposed application estimates the G force experienced by the passengers in case of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to detect accidents. The application reacts to positive detection by sending details about the accident through either e-mail or SMS to pre-defined destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone call to the emergency services. Experimental results using a real vehicle show that the application is able to react to accident events in less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.},

It presents a comprehensive review of research efforts underway dealing with pedestrian safety and collision avoidance. The importance of pedestrian protection is emphasized in a global context, discussing the research programs and efforts in various countries. Pedestrian safety measures, including infrastructure enhancements and passive safety features in vehicles, are described, followed by a systematic description of active safety systems based on pedestrian detection using sensors in vehicle and infrastructure. The pedestrian detection approaches are classified according to various criteria such as the type and configuration of sensors, as well as the video cues and classifiers used in detection algorithms. It is noted that collision avoidance not only requires detection of pedestrians but also requires collision prediction using pedestrian dynamics and behavior analysis. Hence, this paper includes research dealing with probabilistic modeling of pedestrian behavior for predicting collisions between pedestrians and vehicles.},

Previously, the multi filter method is utilized to remove the displacement errors. This paper aims at using a novel application for the neural network prediction models to improve the GPS monitoring time series data. Four prediction models for the learning algorithms are applied and used with neural network solutions: back-propagation, Cascade-forward back-propagation, adaptive filter and extended Kalman filter, to estimate which model can be recommended. The noise simulation and bridge's short-period GPS of the monitoring displacement component of one Hz sampling frequency are used to validate the four models and the previous method. The results show that the Adaptive neural networks filter is suggested for de-noising the observations, specifically for the GPS displacement components of structures. Also, this model is expected to have significant influence on the design of structures in the low frequency responses and measurements' contents.},

  abstract = {Vehicular networks are inseparable components of a smart city environment due to several applications that improve life quality, safety and security. Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures. Moreover open issues and future directions are presented and discussed to help stimulate future studies in this emerging research field.},

Even though the comprehensive use of historical traffic data and assignment models to support the most part of online services and operations, real-time data is extremely important to promote models' accuracy and, therefore, the reliability of information and outputs derived from data fusion and processing. Together with techniques and theoretical formulas we present a case study applied to the Portuguese Brisa's A5 motorway, a 25 km inter-urban highway between Lisbon and Cascais. Traffic on this motorway heading to Lisbon in the morning rush hours typically experiences high levels of congestion. Brisa, the motorway operator company, has equipped A5 with a variety of traffic sensors to be used in a real-time multi-purpose way, either for traffic management and control or for traveler information and third-part applications.},

In this paper, we propose an urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and hidden Markov models (HMM). Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac\- curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth\- ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip\- tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experiments for pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification are con\- ducted independently and both methods achieve nearly 90\% on classification.},

Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly use shallow traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.},

Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our field experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA). We designed and built the components for a pollution monitoring system able to support closed-loop optimization between pollution and traffic management. Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban traffic. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-field experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, the vehicle has been the extension of the man's ambulatory system, docile to the driver's commands. Recent advances in communications, controls and embedded systems have changed this model, paving the way to the Intelligent Vehicle Grid. The car is now a formidable sensor platform, absorbing information from the environment (and from other cars) and feeding it to drivers and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control and traffic management. The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Pioneered by the Google car, the Internet of Vehicles will be a distributed transport fabric capable to make its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g., the smart building), the Internet of Vehicles will have communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers' intentions. The concept that will help transition to the Internet of Vehicles is the Vehicular Cloud, the equivalent of Internet cloud for vehicles, providing all the services required by the autonomous vehicles. In this article, we discuss the evolution from Intelligent Vehicle Grid to Autonomous, Internet-connected Vehicles, and Vehicular Cloud.},

Urban planners are looking for solutions to reduce traffic congestion. Realtime traffic information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and traffic control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.},

Advanced systems to improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart cities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later use, to intelligent control systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously, the possible improvements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous sensing poses numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an overview of the state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical challenges associated with these technologies. In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies play a role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated with these applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies belong to different disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts to bridge these to provide a broad overview, which can be of help to researchers and developers in understanding how advanced sensing can play a role in smart cities.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that aims to connect our environment to the internet in the same way that personal computers connected people. As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},

Mesh networking allows wider low cost Internet access while blockchain enables complete transparency and accountability for investments and revenue or other forms of economic compensations from sharing of network traffic, content and services. Crowdsourcing network coverage combined with crowdfunding costs can create sustainable yet decentralized Internet access infrastructures, where every participant can invest in resources, and pay and be paid for usage. While mesh networks and mesh routing protocols enable self-organized networks that expand organically, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts enable the economic coordination among network providers and consumers. We explore and evaluate two existing blockchain software stacks, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) and Ethereum geth with Proof of Authority (PoA), deployed in a real citywide production mesh network, and in a centralized laboratory network. We quantify the performance, bottlenecks and identify the current limitations and opportunities for improvement to serve the needs of wireless mesh networks.},

However, there are some problems with the growth of the blockchain. The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction. This has the disadvantage that the system doesn't operate without compensation. Also, the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Algorithm using private blockchain has a limited number of acceptable malicious users. In this case, if the users collude with malicious and exceed the limited number, the transaction is rejected.

To facilitate these applications, we present a new routing protocol to enable mesh networking with LoRa, allowing for multihop networking between gateways to extend coverage. Our protocol is tailored specifically to the requirements of LoRa networks.

Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals. The results show our LoRa mesh networking module achieved a 88.49\% packet delivery ratio (PDR), while the LoRaWAN in starnetwork topology was only 58.7\% under the same conditions.},

  shorttitle = {Evaluating {{LoRa}} Energy Efficiency for Adaptive Networks},
  abstract = {The LoRa technology has emerged as an interesting solution for low power, long range IoT applications by proposing multiple ''degrees of freedom'' at the physical layer. This flexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.},

In general, two main categories of networks are used in the IoT: short-range and long-range low-power networks. IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities. Each network category has its unique characteristics and strengths and each category has its important role in the IoT world.},

Thus, fog/edge computing-based IoT becomes future infrastructure on IoT development. To develop fog/edge computing-based IoT infrastructure, the architecture, enabling techniques, and issues related to IoT should be investigated first, and then the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT should be explored.

Research has shown a substantial development of solutions for a wide range of devices and IoT platforms over the past 6-7 years. However, each solution provides its own IoT infrastructure, devices, APIs, and data formats leading to interoperability issues. Such interoperability issues are the consequence of many critical issues such as vendor lock-in, impossibility to develop IoT application exposing cross-platform, and/or cross-domain, difficulty in plugging non-interoperable IoT devices into different IoT platforms, and ultimately prevents the emergence of IoT technology at a large-scale. To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together. This paper performs a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IoT platforms. Also, the key challenges in this topic is presented.},

  abstract = {In the near future, all our everyday things and objects will be both connected to the Internet and equipped with enough sensing, acting and processing capabilities to exploit the full potential benefits of the so called Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Even the simplest objects will become ``smart'' because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},

A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed. The AQRA improves the average end-to-end flow performance by 10.75\%, 11.88\% and 10.82\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. The AQRA improves the standard deviation of end-to-end flow performance by 14.37\%, 17.95\% and 14.28\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. In addition, the runtime of the AQRA is 38.56\% shorter than that of MINA.},

That is why, IoT is presently spanning over a diverse range of applications in the fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, military, industry, etc. The resources IoT requires in those applications are heterogeneous in nature, for example, storage, processor, network, sensor nodes, energy, etc. The obvious challenge is how to manage these limited resources efficiently. Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed. The paper considers with such a future direction of research in this field.},

However, as new emergent technology, IoT suffers from several security issues which are most challenging than those from other fields regarding its complex environment and resources-constrained IoT devices. A lot of researches have been initiated in order to provide efficient security solutions in IoT, particularly to address resources constraints and scalability issues. Furthermore, some technologies related to networking and cryptocurrency fields such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain are revolutionizing the world of the Internet of Things thanks to their efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive top down survey of the most recent proposed security and privacy solutions in IoT.

In this paper, we will conduct a comprehensive survey of the important topics in SDN/OpenFlow implementation, including the basic concept, applications, language abstraction, controller, virtualization, quality of service, security, and its integration with wireless and optical networks. We will compare the pros and cons of different schemes and discuss the future research trends in this exciting area.

Also, access to high bandwidth, extendibility and dynamic management are of critical significance, especially when network devices are vertically integrated. Hence, a set of unique predefined line commands and operating systems or firmware should be used. SDN (software-defined networking) is a structure designed for simplifying and improving network management with high flexibility by splitting control plane and data plane. Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities. Although SDN is regarded as a new research issue, it has attracted numerous researchers' attention from both industrial and academic institutes. In this paper, data plane, control plane and application plane as the three planes of SDN and the interfaces between them such as OpenFlow are investigated and the challenges and the latest technologies in relation to SDN are examined. The investigation and overview of SDN reported in this paper might be used by the interested future researchers to better understand and apply SDN in real-life applications.},

  abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN) brings about innovation, simplicity in network management, and configuration in network computing. Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, thus moving the control logic from the node to a central controller. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature. Moreover, it delves into some of the challenges facing this paradigm, as well as the major SDWSN design requirements that need to be considered to address these challenges.},

In fact, a large number of devices may attempt simultaneously to access the base station, which may result in severe congestions at the random-access channel (RACH) level. To alleviate such congestion while regulating the M2M devices' opportunities to transmit, the Access Class Barring (ACB) process was proposed. In this article, we propose a novel implementation of the ACB mechanism in the context of multiple M2M traffic classes. Based on a scheduling algorithm, we have applied a PID controller to adjust dynamically multiple ACB factors related to each class category, guaranteeing a number of devices around an optimal value that maximizes the Random Access (RA) success probability. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism by increasing the success probability and minimizing radio resources' underutilization with respect to each class priority.},

  abstract = {The next mobile generation is planned to create a networked society, in which Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications are expected to play a key role in a plethora of domains and applications. The massive deployment of such devices may overwhelm the cellular network by imposing strong constraints on the Radio Access Network (RAN) because of the radio resources' scarcity. As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would efficiently help to overcome the risk of congestion. In this paper, we proposed a novel fluid model for M2M communications, which allows gaining an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of such systems. The provided analysis of the model was used to devise a new method to estimate accurately the number of M2M devices willing to connect as well as the number of random access attempts.We proposed, then, a novel implementation of the ACB process, which dynamically computes the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions while includes a corrective action adapting the controller action based on the mismatch existing between the computed and the targeted mean load. Compared to existing approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms allow improving considerably the estimation of the number of M2M devices' arrivals, while outperforming existing techniques in terms of the number of abandons, the success and the collision probabilities, and the average access delay.},

  abstract = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications are expected to be one of the major drivers of future cellular networks, due to a plethora of services provided to operators and consumers. This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion. One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances. Thus, we proposed, in this paper, a new method to estimate accurately the number of random access attempts in a way to measure efficiently the congestion level. Then, we proposed a novel implementation of the ACB process that mainly consists of dynamically adapting the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions by improving significantly the access's success probability while minimizing radio resources' underutilization.

It represents a key component of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart spaces. One of the most difficult challenges to support M2M communications is their huge number compared to available radio resources. Hence, to deal with random access channel (RACH) overload and to better control the access in LTE-A Networks, the 3GPP proposed the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor concept. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve this method based on adaptive multiple ACB factors, according to M2M traffic category with respect to their access delay budget and drop rate (QoS parameters). Simulations were done for testing the effectiveness of our MACB scheme and show that using multiples ACB factors and dynamically adjusting them to the congestion level in addition to traffic type category increases the access probability and reduces overload. The obtained results were then compared to the basic ACB method and show that the access probability increases especially for high priority traffic.},

The IoT vision is to extend the Internet into our everyday lives, so the number of connected devices and innovative applications are growing very fast to bring intelligence into
as many domains as possible. The QoS for IoT application not only depends on the Internet network and communication
infrastructure, it is also impacted by the operation and performance of IoT sensing infrastructure. Therefore, the new QoS parameters such as data accuracy, sampling rate, and
device availability become important for the IoT applications compared to the Internet applications. The huge number of the Internet-connected IoT devices and application, and the spontaneous traffic flow among them make the management of the quality of service complex
across the Internet infrastructure. On the other hand, the non-IP devices and their limited capabilities in terms of energy and transmission create the dynamic environment and hinder the direct interaction between devices and applications. The quality of service is becoming one of the critical non-functional IoT element which needs research and studies. A flexible and scalable QoS management mechanism must be implemented in IoT system to keep up with the growth rate of the Internet-connected IoT devices and applications as well as their heterogeneity and diversity. The solution should address the IoT application requirements and user satisfaction while considering the system dynamism, limitations, and characteristics. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networking which separates the control plane and the data plane of the network elements. It makes the network
elements programmable via the centralized control plane. This approach enables more agile management and control over the network behavior. In this thesis, we take advantage of SDN technology as the future of the Internet to offer a
flexible and adaptive QoS support scheme for the IoT services. We present an SDN-based middleware to define a QoS management framework to manage the application specific QoS
needs across the IoT infrastructure including transport and sensing network. Also, we propose a new QoS model that takes into account the application QoS preferences and the network
elements status to allocate effectively the resources for the applications across SDN network while maximizing network performance.},

  abstract = {Network selection receives considerable attention from communication networks researchers. This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the offered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of e ciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for different multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of different parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study. In the first part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user's preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario. We also improve the latter solution by proposing a network selection algorithm that provides a load balancing technique based on matching game theory to overcome network overload conditions in high-speed scenarios. In the second part, the performance study has been evaluated for two scenario types: Cellular and Vehicular. The proposed algorithms were evaluated and validated in both mobile and vehicular environments using the NS3 simulator.},

To optimize heterogeneous network performance, efficient Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM) mechanisms need to be defined. This paper tackles the access technology selection \textemdash{} a key CRRM functionality \textemdash{} and proposes a hybrid approach that combines benefits from both network-centric and user-centric methods. Network information, that is periodically broadcasted, assists mobile users in their decisions. By broadcasting appropriate decisional information, the network tries to globally control users decision in a way to meet operator objectives. On the other hand, mobiles also integrate their needs and preferences to select their access technology so as to maximize their own utility. In comparison with other RAT selection techniques, including network-centric, hybrid and user-centric methods, simulation results prove the efficiency of our hybrid approach in enhancing resource utilization and maximizing user satisfaction.},

  abstract = {We present a complete simulation and experimentation framework for IEEE 802.11p. The core of the framework is an SDR-based OFDM transceiver that we validated extensively by means of simulations, interoperability tests, and, ultimately, by conducting a field test. Being SDR-based, the transceiver offers important benefits: It provides access to all data down to and including the physical layer, allowing for a better understanding of the system. Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modified. Finally, it enables a seamless switch between simulations and experiments and, thus, helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Comparing the transceiver's performance with independent results from simulations and experiments, we underline its potential to be used as a tool for further studies of IEEE 802.11p networks both in field operational tests as well as for simulation-based development of novel physical layer solutions. To make the framework accessible to fellow researchers and to allow reproduction of the results, we released it under an Open Source license.},

Consequently, a considerable number of applications never seen before is emerging to make daily lifestyle more practical and connected through sharing, storing and processing personal data. When applied to industry, the same technologies can cause a real revolution in the manner how the information is treated. The value of the processed data is increasing fast and point to the fourth industrial revolution, or industry 4.0. This paper evaluates the performance of two ICT (Information and Communication Technology) protocols coming from the consumer world with an enormous potential to be used by industry. Experiments were performed to measure the round trip time using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and WebSocket protocols with the exchange of data between one server in Italy and another in Brazil. The results can be analyzed for each possible application and different network paths. The average latency samples using each of the protocols were similar, defining the payload size of the requests, but changing according to the way.},

The main reason is due to the existence of white spots. The lack of communication between breeders does not allow the dissemination of vital information such as water points location, bush fires geographic location, epidemic area, and available pastureland. However, in undeserved areas, satellite communications are very expensive for rural population. Therefore, we propose a lowcost communication based on LoRa transmission that enables different services like short message text, voice messages, status of a water points, geographic location. The deployed architecture is a delay tolerant ad-hoc network that can cover a large area with a mesh system.},

  abstract = {Recently, various types of services belonging to different domains intertwine together and constitute the Big Service. In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users' complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufficient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great influences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper first defines the SFSD and describes the important influences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},

With the increasing level of air pollution in the city, it requires a device that can monitor air pollution in a real time. By integrating air sensor and Raspberry Pi as data processor and using LoRa module as transceiver module, then the process of transmitting data from transmitter to receiver can be done directly without connected internet. In a test, the system can transmit intensity data information by wireless system on Line Of Sight (LOS) scemes at a maximum distance of 1.7 Km and Non Line Of Sight (NLOS) scheme at a distance of 400 meters with a average delay is 2 second.},

  abstract = {The fundamental properties of long-range (LoRa) performance have been revealed by previous research, but advanced issues remain unresolved. This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance. Last, the application parameters required by the smart energy scenario influence LoRa performance, but their impacts have been scarcely reported. Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that considers performance issues when establishing a LoRa network on a real-world application testbed.},

The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa configuration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the traffic intensity. The comparison shows the benefits of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its configuration according to its link budget.},

One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the traffic congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa. Experimental results show a data reliability of 100 \% and a round-trip latency on the order of milliseconds with end devices dissipating less than 46 mJ when active and 1.83 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}W during periods of inactivity, lasting up to 3 years on a 1200 mA h Lithium battery.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a low-power long-range IoT standard that uses the chirp spread spectrum technique, and we have strived to further extend its coverage by utilizing the direct device-to-device (D2D) links to construct a multi-hop relay network. In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches. We additionally deploy a real-chip experiment to evaluate the feasibility of parallel transmission in practice.},

The measurements were executed for cases when a node located on ground (attached on the roof rack of a car) or on water (attached to the radio mast of a boat) reporting their data to a base station. For a node operating in the 868 MHz ISM band using 14 dBm transmit power and the maximum spreading factor, we have observed the maximum communication range of over 15 km on ground and close to 30 km on water. Besides the actual measurements, in the paper we also present a channel attenuation model derived from the measurement data. The model can be used to estimate the path loss in 868 MHz ISM band in an area similar to Oulu, Finland.},

This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the confidence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability). We provide a model-based and a model-free variants of the elimination method. We further derive stopping conditions guaranteeing that the learned policy is approximately optimal with high probability. Simulations demonstrate a considerable speedup and added robustness over 2-greedy Q-learning.},

For the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the sequence of rewards is chosen by an oblivious adversary, the notion of best arm during the time horizon is too restrictive for applications such as ad-serving, where the best ad could change during time range. In this paper, we consider a variant of the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the time horizon is divided into unknown time periods within which rewards are drawn from stochastic distributions. During each time period, there is an optimal arm which may be different from the optimal arm at the previous time period. We present an algorithm taking advantage of the constant exploration of EXP3 to detect when the best arm changes. Its analysis shows that on a run divided into N periods where the best arm changes, the proposed algorithms achieves a regret in O(N {$\surd$}T log T).},

  title = {Stochastic {{Multi}}-{{Armed}}-{{Bandit Problem}} with {{Non}}-Stationary {{Rewards}}},
  abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem a gambler needs to choose at each round of play one of K arms, each characterized by an unknown reward distribution. Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler's objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T . To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T . This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward ``variation'' and the minimal achievable regret, and by establishing a connection between the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},

A simple two-slope line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight outdoor path loss model is proposed and compared to different existing path loss models. The outdoor path loss is found to be approximately 5 dB higher for 3.5 GHz compared to 1.9 GHz. The outdoor-to-indoor propagation is investigated for two office buildings and different street shops. For the different presented scenarios, penetration loss increases with frequency and is found to be up to 5 dB higher for 3.5 GHz compared with 1.9 GHz.

We first study the unique best arm setting when there exists one unique best arm. Second, we study the general switching best arm setting when a best arm switches at some unknown steps. For both settings, we target problem-dependent bounds, instead of the more conservative problem-free bounds. We consider two classical problems: (1) identify a best arm with high probability (best arm identification), for which the performance measure by the sample complexity (number of samples before finding a near-optimal arm). To this end, we naturally extend the definition of sample complexity so that it makes sense in the switching best arm setting, which may be of independent interest. (2) Achieve the smallest cumulative regret (regret minimization) where the regret is measured with respect to the strategy pulling an arm with the best instantaneous mean at each step.},

In this paper the use of a LoRa technology, originally developed for IoT, is investigated with the aim of implementing distributed measurement systems. After the conclusion that LoRa (Long Range) and LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network) architectures show a good match with measurement systems, the paper focuses on the characterization of time related performance indicators that are important for distributed systems. The experimental results show: the capability of low cost transceiver to schedule the transmission of frames with a standard uncertainty less than 3 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}s; and an acceptable long term clock stability (Allan Deviation) of commercial available devices (nodes and packet forwarders) for application like smart metering, structural health monitoring and process industry.},

  abstract = {Current trends in interconnecting myriad smart objects to monetize on Internet of Things applications have led to high-density communications in wireless sensor networks. This aggravates the already over-congested unlicensed radio bands, calling for new mechanisms to improve spectrum management and energy efficiency, such as transmission power control. Existing protocols are based on simplistic heuristics that often approach interference problems (i.e., packet loss, delay and energy waste) by increasing power, leading to detrimental results. The scope of this work is to investigate how machine learning may be used to bring wireless nodes to the lowest possible transmission power level and, in turn, to respect the quality requirements of the overall network. Lowering transmission power has benefits in terms of both energy consumption and interference. We propose a protocol of transmission power control through a reinforcement learning process that we have set in a multi-agent system. The agents are independent learners using the same exploration strategy and reward structure, leading to an overall cooperative network. The simulation results show that the system converges to an equilibrium where each node transmits at the minimum power while respecting high packet reception ratio constraints. Consequently, the system benefits from low energy consumption and packet delay.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss and analyze the recently proposed LoRa low power wide area network (LPWAN) technology when used under the European frequency regulations. First of all, we derive the performance metrics of a single LoRaWAN end device, namely uplink throughput and data transmission time. Then we analyze for several illustrative application scenarios the maximum number of end devices which can be served by a single LoRaWAN base station and discuss the spatial distribution of these devices. It is shown that subject to the channel composition and application requirements, a single cell may include several millions of devices. Also, we show that the capacity of the uplink channel available to a LoRaWAN node strongly depends on the distance from the base station and does not exceed 2 kbit/s. In the concluding section we summarize and discuss the obtained results, and point out few issues which need to be taken into account when making an application using LoRa or deploying a LoRa network.},

Within this family of possible technology choices, two different branches have emerged: the standards based on spreaded wideband communication and the standards based on narrowband communication, both promising to reach long range connectivity at very low power. More specifically, this paper focuses on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This paper presents a detailed model of CSS, showing that the symbols are not perfectly orthogonal. The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufficient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},

We propose a Markov chain model of the on-the-air activation, and we derive the expected delay and the expected energy required to join the network. We analyze the impact of several parameters on these metrics, including traffic conditions, duty cycles, and channel availability. We also discuss the impact of the regional settings of the standard.

In this paper, the technical differences between a wideband spread spectrum (LoRa-like) and an ultra narrowband (Sigfox-like) network will be explained and evaluated. On the physical layer, simulation results show that an ultra narrowband network has a larger coverage, while wideband spread spectrum networks are less sensitive to interference. When considering the contention between nodes and interference between different networks, simulations show that adaptation of frequency and modulation is imperative for efficiently dealing with varying contention and interference in long range unlicensed networks. Depending on network load, size and distance, a device in a wideband network can send 6 times more packets to the base station when there is active rate and frequency management and an intra-technology control plane.},

New type of connectivity used in LowPower Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech's LoRaTM technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes - LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our findings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks. We gathered measurement data that we make freely available together with the tools we used.},

For IoT, low power consumption and wide area coverage for end devices (ED) are important figures of merit, for which LoRa, SigFox and Narrow Band-IoT are dominant technologies. In this letter, we analyze LoRa systems for increasing average system packet success probability (PSP) under unslotted ALOHA random access protocol. The lower bound for average system PSP is derived when many contending EDs are transmitting by stochastic geometry. And it is shown that the average system PSP can be maximized by properly allocating an SF to each traffic, which also maximizes connectivity of EDs. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the average system PSP to propose a sub-optimal SF allocation scheme to each traffic. Analysis on PSP is validated through simulations, and comparison with existing schemes reveals that our proposed scheme achieves the highest PSP and so the maximum connectivity.},

To validate the module, we compare its results with measurements on a real-world testbed and with measured values reported by other work. We also show that the module correctly represents the capture effect that lowers the packet drop rate due to collisions. Second, we want to improve the performance of LoRa devices while not impacting energy consumption, the aspect that usually is not taken into account in the literature. We use the simulator to evaluate CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), a simple enhancement to LoRaWAN that lowers the collision ratio. The simulation results show that CSMA considerably lowers the collision ratio while only slightly increasing energy consumption. We also observe that CSMA presents lower energy consumption than LoRa for a large number of devices. Another advantage of CSMA consists of increased throughput and larger network capacity because the ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle do not longer apply.},

Although LPWANs attract the interest of industry and network operators, it faces certain constraints related to energy consumption, network coverage and quality of service. In this paper we demonstrate the possibility to optimize the performance of the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, one of the most widely used LPWAN technology. We suggest that nodes use light-weight learning methods, namely, multi-armed bandit algorithms, to select the communication parameters (spreading factor and emission power). Extensive simulations show that such learning methods allow to manage the trade-off between energy consumption and packet loss much better than an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm adapting spreading factors and transmission powers on the basis of Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) values.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the domain of physical/logical objects connected to the Internet that can be accessible anywhere and anytime, giving the access policies. Web objects and services can be seen as distributed and cooperative agents that need to collaborate in order to reach advanced functionalities and also to optimize the overall quality offered to the end users. However, the number of the services that can be supplied through these devices on the Internet will increase more and more. In this context, performing the composition and selection of the best services according to quality-of-service (QoS) criteria become a complex task, especially when dealing with global service selection to satisfy global constraints of users in decentralized environments. For this purpose, we propose a distributed and optimal QoS selection approach based on the multiagent paradigm and the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) formalism. Hence, we revisited a DCOP technique for developing an efficient algorithm: the DPOP4QoS implemented under a real-time Web protocol for IoT communication, the extensible messaging and presence protocol. The proposed algorithm takes into account the specificities of the service composition context and the satisfaction of the global user constraints. This paper also presents a set of experiments conducted under realistic distributed environment to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

In emergency situations such as severe traffic accidents, minimizing the response time, which requires close collaborations between all stakeholders involved and distributed intelligence support, leads to greater survival chance of the injured. However, the current response system is far from efficient, despite the rapid development of information and communication technologies. This paper presents an automated collaboration framework for emergency management that coordinates all stakeholders within the emergency response system and fully automates the rescue process. Applying the concept of multiaccess edge computing architecture, as well as choreography of the service oriented architecture, the system allows seamless coordination between multiple organizations in a distributed way through standard web services. A service choreography is designed to globally model the emergency management process from the time an accident occurs until the rescue is finished. The choreography can be synthesized to generate detailed specification on peer-to-peer interaction logic, and then the specification can be enacted and deployed on cloud infrastructures.},

We present an improved algorithm which rectifies the weaknesses of the original algorithm, as well as a practical, fully functional choreography engine implementation in Flora-2 based on the improved algorithm. Our improvements to the choreography algorithm include (i) the linking of the initial state of the ASM to the precondition of the goal, (ii) the introduction of the concept of a final state in the execution of the ASM and its linking to the postcondition of the goal, and (iii) modification to the execution of the ASM so that it stops when the final state condition is satisfied by the current configuration of the machine. Our choreography engine takes as input semantic web service specifications written in the Flora-2 dialect of F-logic. Furthermore, we prove the equivalence of ASMs (evolving algebras) and evolving ontologies in the sense that one can simulate the other, a first in literature. Finally, we present a visual editor which facilitates the design and deployment of our F-logic based web service and goal specifications.},

The paper presents a new approach of choreography model verification based on Description Logic. A metamodel of service choreography is built to provide a conceptual framework to capture the formal syntax and semantics of service choreography. Based on the framework, a set of rules and constraints are defined in Description Logic for choreography model verification. To automate model verification, the UML-based service choreography model will be transformed, by the given algorithms, into the DL-based ontology, and thus the model properties can be verified by reasoning through the ontology with the help of a popular DL reasoner. A case study is given to demonstrate applicability of the method. Furthermore, the work will be compared with other related researches.},

The WS-CDL describes collaborative business processes between service consumers and providers. Adapting the processes to runtime changes becomes a demanding challenge, because the WS-CDL has static technology-dependent structure, and does not support the separation of concerns. Here, we propose a model-driven approach to transform WS-CDL into UML state machine (behavioral and protocol models), and subsequently into implementation code. Besides separating the business logic from the implementation, the state machine has a dynamic structure which is verifiable and adaptable. As a result, we can easily modify the process flow or change the management rules at run-time, and reflect their effects on the running process instances. We present an `itinerary purchase' case study for prototyping the transformation rules.},

In this paper we discuss the problem of managing multiple choreographies in multi-cloud environments and we advocate that sharing-aware deployment is a more effective and resource-efficient approach. We propose a model for the combined deployment of multiple choreographies on top of a shared set of services, and we further investigate the problem through experiments.},

  abstract = {In the next-generation heterogeneous wireless networks, a mobile terminal with a multi-interface may have network access from different service providers using various technologies. In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a network selection scheme, which is for users that select an optimal network with best comprehensive performance between different types of networks. However, the optimal network may be not the most reasonable one due to compensation of MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making), and the network is called pseudo-optimal network. This paper conducts a performance evaluation of a number of widely used MADM-based methods for network selection that aim to keep the mobile users always best connected anywhere and anytime, where subjective weight and objective weight are all considered. The performance analysis shows that the selection scheme based on MEW (weighted multiplicative method) and combination weight can better avoid accessing pseudo-optimal network for balancing network load and reducing ping-pong effect in comparison with three other MADM solutions.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel deep learning-based channel estimation technique for high-dimensional communication signals that does not require any training. Our method is broadly applicable to channel estimation for multicarrier signals with any number of antennas, and has low enough complexity to be used in a mobile station. The proposed deep channel estimator can outperform LS estimation with nearly the same complexity, and approach MMSE estimation performance to within 1 dB without knowing the second order statistics. The only complexity increase with respect to LS estimator lies in fitting the parameters of a deep neural network (DNN) periodically on the order of the channel coherence time. We empirically show that the main benefit of this method accrues from the ability of this specially designed DNN to exploit correlations in the time-frequency grid. The proposed estimator can also reduce the number of pilot tones needed in an OFDM time-frequency grid, e.g. in an LTE scenario by 98\% (68\%) when the channel coherence time interval is 73ms (4.5ms).},

  abstract = {Proximity-awareness, that is, a mobile device being aware of the presence and capabilities of other devices in its proximity, can be beneficial in many frameworks that support spontaneous sharing of sensors available in advanced personal mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). Providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in such frameworks is highly challenging because of the dynamic and loosely coupled nature of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). A framework called the SPontaneous Information and Resource sharing InfrasTructure (SPIRIT) has been presented before to address the challenges of proximity-aware mobile sensor sharing. SPIRIT allows mobile applications to share sensors as services in an automatic fashion by enabling the service providers and clients to express a variety of QoS specifications. This paper presents a set of mobility-aware QoS mechanisms for enabling the implementation of QoS specifications along the multihop paths between service providers and clients in highly mobile environments. Simulations in small-scale Mobile Ad Hoc Networks show SPIRIT's ability to effectively control and manage traffic flows while maintaining desired QoS. The implications of the proposed QoS mechanisms extend beyond the scope of SPIRIT, as QoS provisioning is an important issue in many MANET frameworks and applications including Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs).},

  abstract = {Due to the rapid growth of mobile data traffic, more and more basestations and access points (APs) have been densely deployed to provide users with ubiquitous network access, which make current wireless network a complex heterogeneous network (HetNet). However, traditional wireless networks are designed with network-centric approaches where different networks have different quality of service (QoS) strategies and cannot easily cooperate with each other to serve network users. Massive network infrastructures could not assure users perceived network and service quality, which is an indisputable fact. To address this issue, we design a new framework for heterogeneous wireless networks with the principle of user-centricity, refactoring the network from users' perspective to suffice their requirements and preferences. Different from network-centric approaches, the proposed framework takes advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and virtualization technology, which will bring better perceived services quality for wireless network users. In the proposed user-centric framework, control plane and data plane are decoupled to manage the HetNets in a flexible and coadjutant way, and resource virtualization technology is introduced to abstract physical resources of HetNets into unified virtualized resources. Hence, ubiquitous and undifferentiated network connectivity and QoE (quality of experience) driven fine-grained resource management could be achieved for wireless network users.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) application deployment requires the allocation of resources such as virtual machines, storage, and network elements that must be deployed over distinct infrastructures such as cloud computing, Cloud of Things (CoT), datacenters and backbone networks. For massive IoT data acquisition, a gateway-based data aggregation approach is commonly used featuring sensor/ actuator seamless access and providing cache/ buffering and preprocessing functionality. In this perspective, gateways acting as producers need to allocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is proposed a Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework (PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources between aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules IoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally,  the framework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled backbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users and consumers. Network resources are allocated using a Bandwidth Allocation Model (BAM) to achieve efficient network resource allocation for scheduled IoT data streams. PSIoT-Orch adopts an ICN (Information-Centric Network) PubSub architecture approach to handle IoT data transfers requests among framework components. The proposed framework aims at gathering the inherent advantages of an ICN-centric approach using a PubSub message scheme while allocating resources efficiently keeping QoS awareness and handling restricted network resources (bandwidth) for massive IoT traffic.},

First, we analyze LoRa modulation numerically and show that collisions between packets of different SFs can indeed cause packet loss if the interference power received is strong enough. Second, we validate such findings using commercial devices, confirming our numerical results. Third, we modified and extended LoRaSim, an open-source LoRa simulator, to measure the impact of inter-SF collisions and fading (which was not taken into account previously in the simulator). Our results show that non-orthogonality of the SFs can deteriorate significantly the performance especially of higher SFs (10 to 12) and that fading has virtually no impact when multiple gateways are available in space diversity.},

In this paper, we propose the architecture of a compact low-cost LoRa smart device designed for easy deployment in smart building applications. The proposed device architecture features a reduced size embedded antenna and an ultra-low-power microcontroller to interface several sensors and actuators. The results obtained have shown that the proposed design can be used for communication, between two compact LoRa devices, in line-of-sight for up to 4.2 km, in urban environments for up to 1.2 km and also for in-building communications for up to 152 m, without compromising the low-power features that LoRa supports.},

RIOT is a prominent free and open source operating system in this space. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive overview of RIOT. We cover the key components of interest to potential developers and users: the kernel, hardware abstraction, and software modularity, both conceptually and in practice for various example configurations. We explain operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and the use of networking. Finally, the relevant APIs as exposed by the operating system are discussed along with the larger ecosystem around RIOT, including development and open source community aspects.},

  abstract = {In this paper the performance of ITS-G5A communications for an autonomous driving application is analyzed in a real high-density scenario. The data was collected during the cooperative platooning tests that took place in Helmond in the frame of the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge 2016. In the competition, between 8-10 autonomous vehicles formed two platoons in different lanes and were required to merge into a predefined competition zone. The performance is characterized using CAM CCDFs which serves as a base for the evaluation of a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control application. Two important effects has been identified that affect to the reliability of the communications. Firstly, there is a degradation with the distance that appears to be stronger for cars and more gentle for trucks. This indicates that occlusions heavily affect the connectivity of ITS-G5A. Secondly, the reliability is below expectations and some of the vehicles perform consistently worse than others. Although further investigation is required, a possible explanation for this is that a highly congested channel is making some of the vehicles get stuck and are not able to regularly access the channel.},

Unnecessary communication loads not only the core network but also the data center that it finds. To do this, fog nodes can pre-process the data before sending it to the cloud. Smart Gateways are suitable candidates for service deployment. This paper presents a design of a service-oriented architecture using smart gateways as fog nodes which reduce service latency.},

In contrast to conventional secure routing protocols in which a central authority (CA) is required to facilitate the identification and authentication of each device, the BCR protocol operates in a distributed manner with no CA. The BCR protocol utilizes smart contracts to discover a route to a destination or data gateway within heterogeneous IoT networks. Any intermediary device can guarantee a route from a source IoT device to a destination device or gateway. We compare the performance of BCR with that of the
              Ad-hoc

  abstract = {The Internet of Things paradigm has brought opportunities to meet several challenges by interconnecting IoT resources, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways on a massive scale. The IoT gateways play an important role in the IoT applications to bridge between sensor networks and the external environment through the Internet. Typically, the IoT gateways collect and send the data collected from sensors and actuators to external platforms where they will be remotely analyzed. However, the users desire a more adapted IoT gateway that can improve the IoT data privacy preservation before sending them to these external platforms. Thus, an IoT gateway that enables a better control over the set of private IoT resources and protects the collected personal data and their privacy is required. For this purpose, we propose a Semantic IoT Gateway that helps implement a dynamic and flexible privacy-preserving solution for the IoT domain. First, it enables to match between the data consumer's terms of service and the data owner's privacy preferences by generating an adapted privacy policy. Second, it converts the privacy policy into a custom smart contract. Finally, it connects a set of private IoT resources to a distributed network using the blockchain technology to host the generated smart contracts. A smart contract is an executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. Our proposal, which is highlighted through an example and experimentation on a real-world use-case, has given the expected results.},

The leading European ITS stakeholders are pushing to start a few ``day-one'' applications in 2015. Among them, the collection of Floating Car Data (FCD) generated by moving vehicles is expected to support many practical use cases in a near future, such as road safety provision, in-vehicle diagnostics, and traffic monitoring. This paper shows that consumer devices on the mass market (such as smartphones) and available networking technologies (such as Wi-Fi and cellular) can compensate for the current lack of dedicated equipment and mature vehicular communication technologies.},

When employing visual sensors in that scenario, still images and video streams may be retrieved from monitored areas, potentially providing valuable data for many applications. Actually, visual sensor networks may need to be highly dynamic, reflecting the changing of parameters in smart cities. In this context, characteristics of visual sensors and conditions of the monitored environment, as well as the status of other concurrent monitoring systems, may affect how visual sensors collect, encode and transmit information. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based approach to dynamically configure the way visual sensors will operate concerning sensing, coding and transmission patterns, exploiting different types of reference parameters. This innovative approach can be considered as the basis for multi-systems smart city applications based on visual monitoring, potentially bringing significant results for this research field.},

We build on previous work in this area [18, 8, 5, 11] with an extensive experimental analysis of protocol operation at a level of detail not previously explored. We report on data gathered with four capture devices from nearly 50 experimental runs conducted with vehicles on a rural highway. Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\% of overall throughput, 15\% of the time. (2) We quantify the effects of ten problems caused by the mechanics of existing protocols that are responsible for this throughput loss; and (3) We recommend best practices for using vehicular opportunistic connections. Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be significantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP. The central message in this paper is that wireless conditions in the vicinity of a roadside access point are predictable, and by exploiting this information, vehicular opportunistic access can be greatly improved.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel adaptive TDMA-based clustering for critical event detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is proposed. The aim of our adaptive approach is to detect the critical event, such a fire detection in the forest, at the required delay with minimum energy consumption. So, when an event occurs, only the sensor nodes in the detection area will be in active mode, while the others will be in sleep mode. The reaction to the event is made locally. This behavior can consume less energy. The simulation results show that our adaptive approach is better than the non-adaptive approach. We have compared our results to other works and we have proved the efficiency of our approach in terms of energy consumption.},

In this paper, we present a dynamic sleep time control method exploiting known traffic statistics to sample the channel more frequently when it is likely to have traffic and less frequently when it is not. When such information is not a priori available, we present an iterative algorithm to learn the statistics and adapt the sleep time control policy as time evolves. Simulation results are included to compare fixed sleep times to a dynamic control policy.},

The proposed M-LEACH is designed for three different segregations for the nodes to elongate the stability \& lifetime of the network. Hence, it increases the heterogeneity \& energy level of the network. In LEACH, amplification energy is set same for all kinds of transmissions. Using low energy level for intra cluster transmissions with respect to cluster head to BS transmission leads in saving much amount of energy. Moreover, multi power levels also reduce the packet drop ratio, collisions and/ or interference for other signals. The proposed MLEACH outperforms in all other existing LEACH variants when compared for FND, HND \& LND.},

Relying on a battery not only limits the sensor's lifetime but also makes efficient design and management of WSNs a real challenge. The energy supply limitation provoked many research on WSN allthe protocol layers. This project focus on efficient sleep/wake-up scheduling, aiming to minimize idle listening time thereby reducing the energy consumption, which is one of the fundamental research problems in WSNs. The nodes are kept in rest mode keeping in mind the end goal to spare the vitality of every node to the extent that this would be possible without comprising on packet delivery effectiveness and consequently lifetime was increased. The proposed strategy proposes a vitality productive directing convention with self versatile sleep/wakeup planning that precisely predicts the path and sends the packet through cluster based predicted path in P-LEACH the cluster arrangement technique of LEACH in the chain based architecture of PEGASIs is utilized. Finally, the simulation results of the proposed method show improved lifetime, low energy utilization and reduced delay.},

But this way of transmitting information through the cluster can lead to uneven energy consumption in the network, which is known as the ``hot zone'' problem. However, the uneven clusters, the way of multi-hop transmission between clusters can solve this problem. According to the characteristics of routing in wireless sensor network, this paper analyzes the defects and disadvantages of the current routing algorithm. This paper proposes a series of improvement measures for the current uneven clustering routing algorithm.

  abstract = {Billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are expected to populate our environments and provide novel pervasive services by interconnecting the physical and digital world. However, the increased connectivity of everyday objects can open manifold security vectors for cybercriminals to perform malicious attacks. These threats are even augmented by the resource constraints and heterogeneity of low-cost IoT devices, which make current host-based and static perimeter-oriented defense mechanisms unsuitable for dynamic IoT environments. Accounting for all these considerations, we reckon that the novel softwarization capabilities of Telco network can fully leverage its privileged position to provide the desired levels of security. To this aim, the emerging software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) paradigms can introduce new security enablers able to increase the level of IoT systems protection. In this paper, we design a novel policy-based framework aiming to exploit SDN/NFV-based security features, by efficiently coupling with existing IoT security approaches. A proof of concept test bed has been developed to assess the feasibility of the proposed architecture. The presented performance evaluation illustrates the benefits of adopting SDN security mechanisms in integrated IoT environments and provides interesting insights in the policy enforcement process to drive future research.},

The current LoRa technology provides a wide range of communication settings whereas many combination settings are orthogonal and, thus, they can be successfully decoded at the gateway when the signals are transmitted simultaneously. Previous simulation results showed that the LoRa network capacity can be improved when multiple communication parameters are applied. In this paper, we model a LoRa network consisting of nodes with different communication settings in terms of bandwidth and spreading factor. We compute the average success probability per configuration as a function of density taking into account both intra and inter-spreading factor collisions. We, also, formulate and solve an optimization problem to maximize the node capacity for a given deployment area and frequency by optimizing the number of nodes having different spreading factor configurations. We present numerical results and we show that solutions close to the optimal can increase the maximum number of nodes by more than 700\% compared to case where equal number of users per spreading factor are considered.},

  abstract = {In power-limited wireless devices such as wireless sensor networks, wearable components, and Internet of Things devices energy efficiency is a critical concern. These devices are usually battery operated and have a radio transceiver that is typically their most power-hungry block. Wake-up radio schemes can be used to achieve a reasonable balance among energy consumption, range, data receiving capabilities and response time. In this paper, a high-sensitivity low power wake-up radio receiver (WUR) for wireless sensor networks is presented. The wake-up radio is comprised of a fully passive differential RF-toDC converter that rectifies the incident RF signal, a low-power comparator and an ultra low power microcontroller to detects the envelope of the on-off keying (OOK) wake-up data used as address. We designed and implemented a novel low power tunable wake up radio with addressing capability, a minimal power consumption of only 196nW and a maximum sensitivity of -55dBm and minimal wake up time of 130{$\mu$}s without addressing and around 1,6ms with 2byte addressing at 10Kbit/s data rate. The flexibility of the solution makes the wake up radio suitable for both power constrained low range application (such as Body Area Network) or applications with long range needs. The wake up radio can work also at different frequencies and the addressing capability directly on board helps reduce false positives. Experimental on field results demonstrate the low power of the solution, the high sensitivity and the functionality.},

Our WRx features very low power consumption ({$<$} 1.3{$\mathrm{\mu}$}W), high sensitivity (up to -55dBm), fast reactivity (wake-up time of 130{$\mathrm{\mu}$}s), and selective addressing, a key enabler of new high performance protocols. We then present ALBAWUR, a cross-layer solution for data gathering in sensing systems that redesigns a previous leading protocol, ALBA-R, extending it to exploit the features of our WRx. We evaluate the performance of ALBA-WUR via simulations, showing that the use of the WRx produces remarkable energy savings (up to five orders of magnitude), and achieves lifetimes that are decades longer than those obtained by ALBA-R in sensing systems with duty cycling, while keeping latencies at bay.},

  abstract = {A fast growing class of sensing technology is wearable, where network nodes are tightly coupled with the human body. Wireless body area networks (WBAN) technology has gained popularity over the last few years, with a wide range of applications covered, in particular in health and rehabilitation. Wearable and pervasive computing are able to sense, monitor and process the data to provide smart assistance and context-aware ambient intelligence environments. However present-day WBAN devices are mainly battery-powered and due to energy issue they need to be recharged every day or even hours and thus they miss the expectations for a truly unobtrusive user experience. This work presents a novel energy-efscient asynchronous MAC protocol using a nano-watt wake up radio with addressing capabilities to reduce the energy consumption of the communication and then extend the WBAN life time. We present the benests of the wake up radio in a star topology widely used in WBAN where the number of the node is around 5 to 10. The implemented protocol exploiting the low power consumption of the wake up radio, the low latency and the addressing capabilities can increase signiscantly the energy efsciency of the single node and entire network reducing both idle listening and data collisions. Result based on measured power consumption and OMNET++ simulation demonstrate that by using the wake up radio it is possible to reduce the power consumption up to 150 times compared to related protocols and the lifetime can be signiscantly increased in a real world scenario.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), Machine-to-MachineCommunication (M2M) and Industry 4.0 are keywords arousing great research interest in recent years. All these terms incorporate the idea of data exchange among diverse objects in wireless sensor networks. In a previous paper, we extended the domain of sensorbased applications to the scope of wildlife tracking, in particular the tracking of bats. The concept of a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) sensor network was introduced, built up by lightweight Ultra Low Power (ULP) nodes attached to the back of the animals, transmitting sensor data via long range telemetry over a distance of several kilometers. The network architecture was discussed and suitable transmission schemes meeting the harsh energy and weight restrictions were evaluated. For an optimal system performance, however, it is also essential that the receiving network is properly designed. In this paper, we elaborate the development of a LPWA reception network of telemetry-related base stations, tackling the highly demanding requirements for mobility, energy efficiency and remote maintainability. Both, hardware as well as software components are addressed and their interactions are illustrated. The energetically self-sustaining base stations are equipped with directional and omni-directional antennas in a MIMO-like fashion. A Software Defined Radio (SDR) controlled frontend allows for a flexible reception and fast data processing. The operation performance toward the stated requirements is evaluated. Finally, initial results of field trials in Berlin (Germany) are presented, proofing the successful recording of actual bat signals.},

  abstract = {Allowing the nodes of a wireless sensor network (WSN) to turn their radio off periodically noticeably increases network lifetime. Duty cycling, however, does not eliminate idle listening, comes at the price of longer latencies and obtains lifetimes that are still insufficient for many critical applications. Using a wake-up receiver (WUR) allows actual communications on the main radio only for transmission or reception, virtually eliminating node idling. However, the range of current WUR prototypes is still significantly shorter than that of the main radio, which can challenge the use of existing WSN protocols in WUR-based networks. In this paper we present an approach to mitigate this limitation of wake-up-based networks. In particular, we show that the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP), a standard protocol for data gathering in WSNs, suitably redefined to work on WUR-endowed nodes, achieves lifetimes of several decades. This constitutes a remarkable improvement over duty cycle-based solutions, where CTP makes the network lasts only a handful of months. At the same time, our WUR-based approach obtains data latencies comparable to those obtained by keeping the main radio always on.},

We call the proposed scheme DCW-MAC where ultra-low-power wake-up receivers are combined with optimal duty-cycled listening. First we introduce a framework for the analysis of energy consumption of the studied network type, then we use it to optimize the MAC scheme to achieve very low total energy consumption per transmitted data packet. It is shown that even with large sacrifices in terms of wake-up receiver detection performance, required to achieve ultra-low-power consumption with a limited form factor, we can achieve very competitive total energy consumption and outperform other MAC schemes for scenarios with low traffic.},

These schemes typically try to find the minimum energy path to optimize energy usage at a node. In this paper we take the view that always using lowest energy paths may not be optimal from the point of view of network lifetime and long-term connectivity. To optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40\% over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing. Nodes also burn energy in a more equitable way across the network ensuring a more graceful degradation of service with time.},

A lightweight yet efficient target localization algorithm is proposed and implemented, and a Quality of Service (QoS) knob is found to control the tradeoff between the tracking error and the network energy consumption.

Although WuR exhibits its superiority for light traffic, it is inefficient to handle high traffic load in a network. This paper makes an effort towards improving the performance of WuR under diverse load conditions with a twofold contribution. We first propose three protocols that support variable traffic loads by enabling respectively clear channel assessment (CCA), backoff plus CCA, and adaptive WuC transmissions. These protocols provide various options for achieving reliable data transmission, low latency, and energy efficiency for ultra-low power consumption applications. Then, we develop an analytical framework based on an M/G/1/2 queue to evaluate the performance of these WuR protocols. Discrete-event simulations validate the accuracy of the analytical models.},

  abstract = {Radio transceiver often consumes most of energy in a sensor node. To achieve low power consumption, every node periodically schedules its radio transceiver into sleep or active state, which is usually called duty cycle mechanism in MAC protocol. In this paper, we design a novel Prediction-Based Asynchronous MAC protocol (PBA-MAC) for heavy traffic load in wireless sensor networks. PBA-MAC applies an efficient wakeup mechanism to save the energy of a sensor node as much as possible. It reduces communication cost by enabling a sender to predict the intended receiver's wakeup time, without introducing unnecessary idle listening or overhearing cost. In addition, it introduces an exponential advance mechanism to handle the prediction error caused by clock drift and hardware platform latency. More importantly, its backcast-based retransmission characteristic can efficiently resolve severe wireless collisions caused by concurrent traffic flows. The PBA-MAC is implemented in Contiki operating system. We compare PBA-MAC to some existing energy-efficient MAC protocols. The experimental results show that PBAMAC significantly improves network energy efficiency and reduces packet delivery latency even under heavy traffic load.},

Correspondingly sending nodes transmit packets in a traditional way by competing with one another multiple times in a single operational cycle. In this paper, we propose a receiver-initiated consecutive packet transmission WuR (RI-CPT-WuR) medium access control (MAC) protocol, which eliminates multiple competitions to achieve higher energy efficiency. Furthermore, we develop two associated discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs) for evaluating the performance of RI-CPT-WuR and an existing RI-WuR MAC protocol. Using the solutions from the DTMC models, closed-form expressions for network throughput, average delay, packet reliability ratio, energy consumption and lifetime, and energy efficiency for both protocols are obtained. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the RI-CPT-WuR protocol.},

B-MAC supports on-the-fly reconfiguration and provides bidirectional interfaces for system services to optimize performance, whether it be for throughput, latency, or power conservation. We build an analytical model of a class of sensor network applications. We use the model to show the effect of changing B-MAC's parameters and predict the behavior of sensor network applications. By comparing B-MAC to conventional 802.11inspired protocols, specifically S-MAC, we develop an experimental characterization of B-MAC over a wide range of network conditions. We show that B-MAC's flexibility results in better packet delivery rates, throughput, latency, and energy consumption than S-MAC. By deploying a real world monitoring application with multihop networking, we validate our protocol design and model.

One approach proposes switching off the main receiver, then introduces new wake-up circuitry capable of detecting an incoming transmission, optionally discriminating the packet destination using addressing, then switching on the main radio only when required. This wake-up receiver technology represents the ultimate frontier in low power radio communication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review of the research progress in wake-up radio (WuR) hardware and relevant networking software. First, we present an overview of the WuR system architecture, including challenges to hardware design and a comparison of solutions presented throughout the last decade.

  abstract = {Radio communication remains the primary battery consuming activity in wireless systems. Advances in MAC protocols have enabled significant lifetime improvements, but in systems with low data rate, idle listening, and other communication artifacts can begin to dominate costs. One proposal to combat this is the addition of a second, extremely low power radio component that is always-on. As a consequence of the extremely low power, such radios are incapable of decoding general data, and thus are often delegated the task of listening for a trigger, leading to the terminology wake-up radio, as this extremely low power radio is used to wake up a higher power radio, which is then used for data communication. While wake-up technology has been steadily evolving over the last decade in the hardware arena, few protocols have been developed to exploit it. In this work, we present WaCo, our wake-up radio COOJA extension that allows exploration of the capabilities of the wake-up radio from the desktop environment. We also use our extended simulator to concretely show the potential benefits of the wake-up radio hardware with two, standard data collection protocols. Our results simultaneously confirm that wake-up technology has tremendous potential and that our simulator extension provides an effective mechanism for such exploration.},

Unlike other protocols, the WUR-MAC takes advantage of the WUR ultra-low power listening mode leaving it permanently active to wait for incoming requests. Due to the ultra low power nature of these radio receivers, energy consumption and latency can be optimized at the same time. Energy consumption of the combined physical and MAC layer of a WUR based design is compared to efficient schedule based low power MAC protocols using the same main underlying transceiver without a wakeup radio receiver. WUR-MAC is based on proven MAC concepts but avoids complicated algorithms that are needed to synchronize nodes in traditional WSNs. Simulation results show that with typically low traffic, the average power consumption of schedule-based MACs is significantly higher than by using WUR-MAC only in the case where very low power Wakeup Receivers ({$<$}40 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}W always on) are used. Delay is improved in any case due to the always on nature of the Wakeup Receiver.},

Instead of minimizing the consumed energy as for the case of battery-powered systems, the harvesting node is adapted to Energy Neutral Operation (ENO) to achieve a theoretically infinite lifetime. Therefore, consumed energy due to communications is the critical issue to increase the system performance. In this paper, a nanowatt wake-up radio receiver (WUR) is used cooperatively with the main transceiver in order to reduce the wasted energy of idle listening in asynchronous MAC protocols where the node is waiting for potential messages, while still maintaining the same reactivity. Simulation results show that the throughput can be improve up to 82\% with 53\% energy saving compared to non-WUR approach of the TICER protocol.

Standard MAC protocols developed for duty-cycled WSNs such as BMAC, which is the default MAC protocol for TinyOS, employ an extended preamble and preamble sampling. While this ``low power listening'' approach is simple, asynchronous, and energy-efficient, the long preamble introduces excess latency at each hop, is suboptimal in terms of energy consumption, and suffers from excess energy consumption at nontarget receivers. X-MAC proposes solutions to each of these problems by employing a shortened preamble approach that retains the advantages of low power listening, namely low power communication, simplicity and a decoupling of transmitter and receiver sleep schedules. We demonstrate through implementation and evaluation in a wireless sensor testbed that X-MAC's shortened preamble approach significantly reduces energy usage at both the transmitter and receiver, reduces per-hop latency, and offers additional advantages such as flexible adaptation to both bursty and periodic sensor data sources.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the challenge of rapidly disseminating rare events through a multi-hop network, while achieving unprecedented energy-efficiency. Contrary to state-of-theart approaches, we circumvent the undesirable trade-offs associated with low-power duty-cycled protocols and backscatter technologies, and demonstrate a paradigm shift in lowpower protocol design. We present Zippy, an on-demand flooding technique that provides robust asynchronous network wake-up, fine-grained per-hop synchronization and efficient data dissemination by leveraging low-complexity transmitter and receiver hardware. We are the first to demonstrate the on-demand flooding of rare events through a multihop network with end-to-end latencies of tens of milliseconds, while dissipating less than 10 microwatts during periods of inactivity. We present a prototype implementation of our proposed approach using a wireless sensor platform constructed from commercially available components. We extensively evaluate Zippy's performance in a laboratory setting and in an indoor testbed.},

  abstract = {Performing non-aggregate range queries on cloud stored data, while achieving both privacy and efficiency is a challenging problem. This paper proposes constructing a differentially private index to an outsourced encrypted dataset. Efficiency is enabled by using a cleartext index structure to perform range queries. Security relies on both differential privacy (of the index) and semantic security (of the encrypted dataset). Our solution, PINED-RQ develops algorithms for building and updating the differentially private index. Compared to state-ofthe-art secure index based range query processing approaches, PINED-RQ executes queries in the order of at least one magnitude faster. The security of PINED-RQ is proved and its efficiency is assessed by an extensive experimental validation.},

  abstract = {Long-range radio transmissions open new sensor application fields, in particular for environment monitoring. For example, the LoRa radio protocol enables connecting remote sensors at a distance as long as ten kilometers in a line-of-sight. However, the large area covered also brings several difficulties, such as the placement of sensing devices in regards to topology in geography, or the variability of communication latency. Sensing the environment also carries constraints related to the interest of sensing points in relation to a physical phenomenon. Thus, criteria for designs are evolving a lot from the existing methods, especially in complex terrains. This article describes simulation techniques based on geography analysis to compute long-range radio coverages and radio characteristics in these situations. As radio propagation is just a particular case of physical phenomena, it is shown how a unified approach also allows for characterizing the behavior of potential physical risks. The case of heavy rainfall and flooding is investigated. Geography analysis is achieved using segmentation tools to produce cellular systems which are in turn translated into code for high-performance computations. The paper provides results from practical complex terrain experiments using LoRa, which confirm the accuracy of the simulation, and scheduling characteristics for sample networks. Performance tables are produced for these simulations on current Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).},

  abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies such as Long Range (LoRa) are emerging that enable power efficient wireless communication over very long distances. LPWAN devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multi-hop network. However, to ensure efficient and reliable communication LPWAN devices often provide a large number of transmission parameters. For example, a LoRa device can be configured to use different spreading factors, bandwidth settings, coding rates and transmission powers, resulting in over 6720 possible settings. It is a challenge to determine the setting that minimises transmission energy cost while meeting the required communication performance. This paper is the first to present a thorough analysis of the impact of LoRa transmission parameter selection on communication performance. We study in detail the impact of parameter settings on energy consumption and communication reliability. Using this study we develop a link probing regime which enables us to quickly determine transmission settings that satisfy performance requirements. The presented work is a first step towards an automated mechanism for LoRa transmission parameter selection that a deployed LoRa network requires, but is not yet specified within the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) framework.},

These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard. We also discuss the research challenges and perspectives.},

  abstract = {As a possible implementation of a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), Long Range (LoRa) technology is considered to be the future wireless communication standard for the Internet of Things (IoT) as it offers competitive features, such as a long communication range, low cost, and reduced power consumption, which make it an optimum alternative to the current wireless sensor networks and conventional cellular technologies. However, the limited bandwidth available for physical layer modulation in LoRa makes it unsuitable for high bit rate data transfer from devices like image sensors. In this paper, we propose a new method for mangrove forest monitoring in Malaysia, wherein we transfer image sensor data over the LoRa physical layer (PHY) in a node-to-node network model. In implementing this method, we produce a novel scheme for overcoming the bandwidth limitation of LoRa. With this scheme the images, which requires high data rate to transfer, collected by the sensor are encrypted as hexadecimal data and then split into packets for transfer via the LoRa physical layer (PHY). To assess the quality of images transferred using this scheme, we measured the packet loss rate, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) index of each image. These measurements verify the proposed scheme for image transmission, and support the industrial and academic trend which promotes LoRa as the future solution for IoT infrastructure.},

LoRa, one of most prevalent long-range wireless communication technologies, can be used to underpin the development of smart cities. This study draws upon relevant research to gain an understanding of underlying principles and issues involved in the design and management of long-range and low-power networks such as LoRa. This research uses empirical evidence that has been gathered through experiments with a LoRa network to analyse network design and identify challenges and then proposes cost-effective and timely solutions. Particularly, practical measurements of LoRa network dependencies and performance metrics are used to support our proposals. This research identifies a number of network performance metrics that need to be considered and controlled when designing and managing LoRaspecific networks from the perspectives of hardware, software, networking and security.},

  abstract = {Knowing the heterogeneity of applications and services that need to to be supported in the internet of things (IoT), network slicing came out as a potential solution that virtually isolates 5G networks with various service requirements over a common physical network infrastructure. The latter needs to simultaneously support and isolate traffic issued from mobile and machine services which may require different needs in terms of reliability, latency, and bandwidth. In this paper, network slicing is investigated in LoRa networks over fixed and dynamic slicing strategies. The performance of LoRa slices is evaluated with different spreading factor (SF) configurations. Then, a dynamic inter-slicing algorithm is proposed based on a maximum likelihood estimation that avoids resource starvation and prioritizes a slice over another depending on its QoS requirements. Moreover, a novel intra-slicing strategy is proposed that maximizes resource allocation efficiency of LoRa slices with regard to their delay requirements. An energy module for LoRa in NS3 is also implemented to evaluate the energy consumption of devices in each slice. Simulation results performed in realistic LoRa scenarios highlight the utility of our proposition in improving QoS requirements of IoT devices and providing isolation between slices.},

The message delivery between participated nodes and gateway in the WSNs affects the quality of service (QoS) such as energy consumption and the successful delivery rate (SDR). In this paper, we present a novel packet transmission model for a smart wireless paging sensor network (WPSN) based on LoRaWAN, which supports a real-time elderly care application. The model is used to investigate the performance of star topology communication on elderly care via Markov discrete-time M/M/1 queuing system. The proposed traffic model enables the performance evaluation of WPSN for elderly care. Moreover, an optimal cluster allocation policy is proposed by which maximizing SDR are obtained and QoS constraint requirements are met in terms of energy consumption. We conduct analytic analysis and simulation to exploit the QoS of LoRa based WSNs for elderly care application. The proposed WPSN is experimental studied and validated in a real elder care scenario.

Moreover, the wireless communication channel opens up the door for several types of remote attacks. Therefore, the communication channel between the vehicle and ground control station (GCS) should be secure and has to provide an efficient data link.

The conventional cloud applications are deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) according to the application requirements and data traffic situations, and the users are controlled with out-ofband C-plane to connect to the surrounding MEC applications. For the installation of MEC in the heterogeneous cellular networks, to the best of authors knowledge, there is no research conducted on whether a business model can be established when additional fees are paid for MEC.

A proactive cache technology, which allocates cache data to MEC servers accessed by mobile terminals in advance, is one of technologies to provide the data in a low latency for the mobile terminals. The technology, however, less considers both of the cache placement in time for handover (HO) of mobile terminals and the increase in the traffic between MEC servers for cache distribution. The increase in the traffic is caused by duplicated routes of cache transfer from a location of content data to cache locations and by cache placements on more MEC servers to improve cache hit rate according to a mobile terminal transition. In this paper, we propose a novel proactive cache system which transfers cache data in time for HO of mobile terminals and reduces the traffic between MEC servers, using a route de-duplicating technique for cache transfer and selective data delivery utilizing the locations of mobile terminals predicted from cellular-radio information. We also propose the system architecture which enables services to utilize cellular-radio information by APIs, and evaluate the system by a simulation of the HO prediction and the estimation of the traffic between MEC servers for transferring caches. Numerical results indicate 49.1\% reduction of the total traffic between MEC servers and reveal characteristics and problems of the cache system using cellular-radio information.},

Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adaptive DC decision algorithm. The proposed algorithm aims at adapting the period that the system interferes with others and reducing the packet loss rate of uplink communication of the whole system to below the required value by adapting DC with the help of measurement-based spectrum database (MSD). In the proposed method, MSD knows the number of LoRa nodes that interfere with the nodes of other systems. The DC is calculated for keeping the period of interference to less than a certain duration. In addition, the DC is also adapted based on the required packet loss rate to improve communication efficiency. Computer simulation results show that the allowable interference time ratio and the required packet loss rate can be accurately guaranteed compared to the conventional method with the fixed DC even if the number of nodes increases.},

Secondly, Google Colab as the training server will be used to store the training data set and building the Tensorflow-based Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model. This recurrent neural network model will forecast electricity bill and notify users if abnormal energy consumption of individual home appliances is detected.

Twodimensional (2D) chess corners are reprojected into 3D space for plane fitting. RANSAC algorithm is applied on LIDAR points before they are used for plane fitting. The mutual rotation between the camera and LIDAR is calculated by aligning the normal vectors of plane fitting results. An arbitrary point from the camera plane is projected on to the LIDAR plane and the distance is minimized to estimate the mutual translation.

However, in the conventional method, the P-QRS-T wave must be accurately detected, and the feature value is extracted through the P-QRS-T wave.

Considering back-off power control, information signal of near user is split into two data streams for uplink transmissions, whereas information signal of far user is transmitted without rate splitting. In the FRS scheme, a fixed power allocation factor is applied at near user for allocating transmit power between data streams. At the BS receiver, successive interference cancellation is applied for recovering all data streams. Motivated by cognitive radio principles, a dynamic power allocation factor is designed for the ARS scheme based on instantaneous channel state information. Closed-form expressions are derived for outage probabilities of the near and far users, respectively. In addition, analytical expressions are derived for asymptotic outage probabilities of the FRS and ARS schemes, respectively.

  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a promising technology for 5G mobile communication networks due to several benefits such as highly increased spectral efficiency, extended coverage, reduced latency, and enhanced cost and power efficiency. However, the multi-hop routing protocol faces many challenges in the D2D communication. In this paper, a socialaware routing algorithm is proposed to design the multi-hop path in the cellular network. Based on the Friis transmission equation, we drive the received power distribution and construct a relay cellular network. In addition, the congested ratio and average congested intensity are important indices to measure network congestion. To investigate the impact of network congestion on the end-to-end delay, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in three different congested ratio networks. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm in terms of reducing the end-to-end delay.},

In fields of aquaculture and agriculture, live creatures are the main products and are difficult to perform warehouse management. Warehousing of high unit-price ornamental fishes such as koi, stingray, and arowana is even more difficult since the warehousing requires identification, in addition to simple counting and classification, of individuals whose shapes and texture patterns are time-variant as they grow. Therefore, rather than using invasive RFID-based systems, we combine mobile cloud computing and big data analytics techniques including image and video collecting and transmission by handheld mobile devices, unsupervised texture pattern classification in fish tank videos, image retrieval based on support vector machine, and statistical analysis for the warehouse management. The proposed system is scalable based on Hadoop framework and a small unit of a single name-node and data-node is able to identify a fish feature among 500,000 koi fishes in 7 seconds.},

Considering this existing gap in the Internet of Things (IoT) area, this paper proposes a mechanism for discovering, connecting, and identifying heterogeneous Bluetooth-enabled IoT devices of unknown device type, in order to be integrated into different platforms. This mechanism implements three (3) stages to successfully identify an unknown device. Initially, the discovery and the connection of both known and unknown devices take place so as to retrieve explicitly required specifications of these devices. Sequentially, the measurement of the syntactic similarity of all the devices' specifications and the comparison among the derived results occurs. Based on these results, the estimation of the overall syntactic similarity takes place, identifying finally the device type of the connected unknown devices. The prototype associated with this paper provides an example of this mechanism, demonstrating in detail each stage.},

As a result, image quality assessment (IQA) methods designed for natural images are not always suitable for screen content images. However, as time goes, many screen contents are being generated which share several properties of natural images. As a result, IQA methods for SCI need to be more generic while giving priority to the prominent SCI features. The image gradient is a very important feature for all kinds of images, especially for SCI. In this paper, we proposed a novel image gradient based similarity index (CGSI) for screen content images where the gradient is used both as a quality map and extractor for another feature map. Our previous studies show that the center part of an image is visually the most important part and HVS is more sensitive to any distortion in the middle area. To address this issue, the center area of both gradient and feature similarity maps are raised by element-wise squaring. Eventually, the final quality score is calculated using a summation of standard deviation based pooling strategy. We evaluated our proposed method on three large scale SCI databases and compared with 8 other state-of-the-art IQA methods designed for both natural and screen content images. Results show that the proposed approach provides competitive performance and defeats all other methods with a large gap in overall performance. Also, the relatively faster running time makes it suitable for most of the real-time applications.},

Unlike the half-duplex (HD) cellular systems, the extra residual self-interference (RSI) and the cochannel interference (CCI) are involved in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) received signals due to the simultaneous transmission and reception in an FD base station (BS). Accordingly, we aim at developing the UL and DL precoders to suppress the influence of the RSI and CCI, where the EE criterion is adopted to reach the goal of the green communication. However, the EE precoder design is a fractional non-convex problem. To find the tractable solution, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) method to conduct the DL and UL precoders iteratively. For given DL precoders, the closed-form solution of UL precoders can be eventually yielded by an iterative water-filling (IWF) procedure. Nevertheless, the similar method cannot directly be applied to optimize the DL precoders. We then resort to the UL-DL duality that transfers the DL precoder design to an equivalent UL precoder design problem. We further apply the primal-dual decomposition to the DL precoder design and solve it by the IWF algorithm. Finally, the performance of the proposed design is verified by computer simulations and the result shows its superiority over the existing design.},

  title = {Hash-Based {{OpenFlow Packet Classification}} on {{Heterogeneous System Architecture}}},
  abstract = {Packet classification is a very important component for today's network architecture. It can help or provide packet forwarding and other network functions. With the development of Internet and the emergence of software-defined networking (SDN), the methods designed for the traditional 5-dimensional rule set is not sufficient to process the current rule set that contains rules of 12 or more dimensions. The main problem is to process the rule sets of 12 or more dimensions in high throughput. To achieve high throughput, we study the implementations on GPU where some use a single hash table and others use Binary Range Tree to process the searching. In 12dimensional rule sets defined by OpenFlow 1.0, 8 fields are in the format of exact value or wildcard, and so using the single hash table or binary range tree is not efficient. Another problem to implement packet classification on GPU is that we must transfer the input data and results via the PCI-E bus that will incur long bus latency. In this paper, we propose a modified hash table to process the fields that contain only exact value or wildcard, and use the compressing method to reduce memory consumption. On the other hand, we implement the proposed method on APU that uses Heterogeneous System Architecture to skip the bus latency. According to the experimental results on AMD A107850 APU, our method can achieve the throughput of 1814 MPPS, and can support the rule sets of more than 12K 12-dimensional rules. The achieved throughput is 10 times of the methods on legacy GPU.},

  title = {An {{SDN}}/{{NFV}}-{{Enabled Architecture}} for {{Detecting Personally Identifiable Information Leaks}} on {{Network Traffic}}},
  abstract = {The widespread adoption of social networking and cloud computing has transformed today's Internet to a trove of personal information. As a consequence, data breaches are expected to increase in gravity and occurrence. To counteract unintended data disclosure, a great deal of effort has been dedicated in devising methods for uncovering privacy leaks. Existing solutions, however, have not addressed the time- and data-intensive nature of leak detection. The shift from hardware-specific implementation to software-based solutions is the core idea behind the concept of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). On the other hand, the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm is characterized by the decoupling of the forwarding and control planes. In this paper, an SDN/NFV-enabled architecture is proposed for improving the efficiency of leak detection systems. Employing a previously developed identification strategy, Personally Identifiable Information detector (PIID) and load balancer VNFs are packaged and deployed in OpenStack through an NFV MANO. Meanwhile, SDN controllers permit the load balancer to dynamically redistribute traffic among the PIID instances. In a physical testbed, tests are conducted to evaluate the proposed architecture. Experimental results indicate that the proportions of forwarding and parsing on total overhead is influenced by the traffic intensity. Furthermore, an NFV-enabled system with scalability features was found to outperform a nonvirtualized implementation in terms of latency (85.1\%), packet loss (98.3\%) and throughput (8.41\%).},

A third party network can be a community network managed by its users, a Wi-Fi mesh network or a licensed band femtocell. Recently, many studies have emerged related to mobile data offloading.

Use of CCN in wireless environment can cause various issues such as re-transmissions, collisions, delay and link failure. One of the key issues that affects the performance of CCN is the management of Pending Interest Table (PIT). PIT stores each broadcasted Interest packet forwarded upstream towards the content provider and is purged either when the requested content is returned or the PIT Entry Lifetime (PEL) expires. The conventional method in CCN for PEL does not considering the network impairments such as channel error, and congestion. As a result, timeout occurs, and Interest packets are re-transmitted for the chunks that have been dropped or delayed. Due to limited size of storage in wireless CCN, all new incoming Interest packets (including retransmissions) affect the performance of network by bloating PIT. In this paper, therefore, we propose a scheme that purges the PIT entries quickly by prefetching the un-obtained content in advance. Simulation results show that proposed protocol performs better as comparing with the conventional CCN and another recent proposed protocol.},

The difference between it and the existing congestion control algorithm is that it is derived from actual congestions. BBR measures the bottleneck bandwidth and round-trip propagation time sequentially and sends data based on bandwidth delay product (BDP). The mere dependence on the BDP unfairly allocates a larger part of the bandwidth to a flow with long RTT than a short RTT flow. This nature of the BBR entirely conflicts with the trend of traditional TCP where a short RTT flow is more vibrant than long RTT flow. To solve this problem, we previously proposed the bottleneck queue buildup suppression method and verified that through NS-3. However, during the testbed experiments, we found that the previous method was unstable and led to unexpected results. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an improved version of the previously proposed algorithm. We confirmed through extensive testbed experiments that our proposed BBR-E improves fairness between the flows with different RTTs and ensures better throughput.},

Machine learning has recently become attractive as an optimization algorithm, and in this paper we propose to apply machine learning with a back propagation method for indoor location estimation using multiple items of sensed information. Our proposed machine learning location estimation method is experimentally validated and compared with the MMSE method.

The common practice of clinical treatment is gradually being overhauled by ubiquitous healthcare systems. The wireless body area networks (WBANs) are becoming increasingly important for future healthcare applications. According to the human physiological information, WBAN not only sends the real-time notification to the user but also decreases the transmission delay of patient information to the physician for medical decision. When medical emergency information must be transmitted after a disaster occurrence, the number of WBANs and emergency traffic increase in the particular area. In the situations, a large number of WBANs may be close to each other, thus causing inter-WBAN interference and increasing the transmission delay. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dynamic channel selection scheme (DCSS) in IEEE 802.15.6 WBANs. DCSS records the channel interference degree which is used to adaptively select the best transmission channel and to effectively transmit data. It mitigates the inter-WBAN interference to improve the QoS violation and reduce power consumption when there are WBANs coexisting.},

Visible light positioning (VLP) is often combined with VLC to offer multi-functionalities of illumination, communication, and localization. In this paper, we investigate coverage area and `dead-zone' for the localization of an indoor flying receiver (e.g. drones). For accurate positioning, VLP requires a signal from more than two transmitters. However, the signal from the minimum number of transmitters may not always be available especially in the area close to the walls leading to inaccurate positioning (the deadzone). The simulation for a typical industrial environment shows that the loss of a signal due to a dead-zone is highly dependent on the divergence angle of transmitters and the field of view of the receiver. The maximum height a drone can reach with a field of view of 85\textdegree{} for VLP systems is about 7.8 m for up to four transmitters without encountering any dead-zones.},

It constructs shortest-path trees in a virtual 3D grid topology and uses them to obtain routing paths between sensor nodes and sink nodes. It has been claimed that due to the availability of these pre-constructed shortestpath trees, TBR is expected to outperform other protocols. In this work we investigate the validity of this claim by implementing TBR, evaluating its performance and comparing it to the well-known Vector-Based Forwarding (VBF) protocol by simulation. The delivery ratio and communication delay were measured under varying network density, node mobility and traffic load conditions. The obtained results show that TBR does outperform VBF (twice or more better) in terms of these measures. It was also observed from the simulation results that TBR performs better under low node mobility conditions. TBR consumes however more energy than VBF.},

In more detail, we first select the best tag based on the channel gain between a tag and a reader and then select another tag for generating artificial noise affecting an eavesdropper. Consequently, we propose a scheduling criterion to choose both information and artificial noise tags. In addition, we apply a successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique at the reader in order to eliminate the interference from the artificial noise tag. The simulation results show that our proposed ANTS scheme can obtain a better secrecy rate as the channel gain between the tag and the receiver increases and the number of tags increases. Moreover, when the number of tags is sufficiently large, the proposed ANTS scheme significantly outperforms the conventional scheme in terms of average secrecy rate.},

  title = {A High-Speed Key Management Method for Quantum Key Distribution Network},
  abstract = {Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a technique for sharing encryption keys between two adjacent nodes. It provides unconditional secure communication based on the laws of physics. From the viewpoint of network research, QKD is considered to be a component for providing secure communication in network systems. A QKD network enables each node to exchange encryption keys with arbitrary nodes. However previous research did not focus on the processing speed of the key management method essential for a QKD network. This paper focuses on the key management method assuming a high-speed QKD system for which we clarify the design, propose a high-speed method, and evaluate the throughput. The proposed method consists of four modules: (1) local key manager handling the keys generated by QKD, (2) one-time pad tunnel manager establishing the transparent encryption link, (3) global key manager generating the keys for application communication, and (4) web API providing keys to the application. The proposed method was implemented in software and evaluated by emulating QKD key generation and application key consumption. The evaluation result reveals that it is capable of handling the encryption keys at a speed of 414 Mb/s, 185 Mb/s, 85 Mb/s and 971 Mb/s, for local key manager, one-time pad tunnel manager, global key manager and web API, respectively. These are sufficient for integration with a high-speed QKD system. Furthermore, the method allows the high-speed QKD system consisting of two nodes to expand corresponding to the size of the QKD network without losing the speed advantage.},

With this, several countries have already implemented a Health Information Exchange (HIE) to enable interoperability in their areas.

OpenHIE provides a framework for implementing an HIE which is based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Its design has been proven to work, and other countries and organizations have shown interest in adopting its components. Currently, OpenHIE can provide the de facto standard for securing health information systems. However, several essential security features concerning the privacy of health information have yet to be implemented. Here we explore the application of Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) on OpenHIE to realize the aforementioned security features. Results show that applying CP-ABE will not only change the implementation of the functionalities of the HIE, but it will also add an overhead to its non-functional characteristics, such as the number of transactions per second, memory, and bandwidth usage.},

In our previous research we have devised an Information Flow security model that gives the vertices and edges numerical attributes, based on their user credibility and connection strength, such as age of user account and the friendship duration of two users, from which we have assessed the level of information sharing willingness of an ego node to users that are not directly connected to it, thus categorizing them as adversaries or acquaintances. In this research we use this model to generate a trustworthy network of users by creating a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph instance and iterating the removal of the weak-attributed edges and their connected vertices. We use a known MST algorithm (Kruskal's algorithm) on this unique graph, thus achieving a good Trust threshold of a user network that allows a safe information flow in the OSN.

The aggregator participates in energy market to maximize his profit by selling the storage to the residential users. Each user determines his energy consumption schedule and a required amount of storage to minimize his energy cost depending on the unit price of energy storage, price profile of electricity from the main grid and his renewable power generation capacity. We consider electricity bill from main grid and storage bill from the aggregator as users' energy cost. We formulate a problem for the aggregator to decide an optimal unit price of energy storage and a problem for each user to decide energy consumption schedule and a required amount of storage capacity. With numerical investigation, it is shown that the energy storage can reduce the energy load to main grid and shave peak power. As a result, by purchasing energy storage, users can save their energy cost by 43\% in average compared to the case without energy storage.},

However, since there is a limit in the frequency resource, it has become very important to improve the spectral efficiency. In-Band Full Duplex (IBFD) systems can improve spectral efficiency up to 2 times. In this IBFD system, the Self-Interference (SI) occurs inherently, so the desired received signal cannot be demodulated. SelfInterference Cancellation (SIC) must be required to solve this problem. In this paper, a Balanced Feed Network (BFN) based system is designed and evaluated to improve SIC performance at the target frequency 2.45GHz. Simulation results show that the SIC performance is improved by 3 dB compared to the existing system. However, it is also confirmed that the transmission power is decreased by 3 dB.},

The advances in DCNN have led to the development of autonomous vehicles that can drive with no driver controls by using sensors like camera, LiDAR, etc. In this paper, we propose a practical method to implement autonomous indoor navigation based on semantic image segmentation using state-ofthe-art performance model on mobile devices, especially Android devices. We apply a system called 'Mobile DeepLabv3', which uses atrous convolution when applying semantic image segmentation by using MobileNetV2 as a network backbone. The ADE20K dataset is used to train our models specific to indoor environments. Since this model is for robot navigating, we re-label 150 classes into 20 classes in order to easily classify obstacles and road. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity, as well as actual latency and the number of parameters of the trained models.},

In IEEE 802.15.4, the medium access control mechanism is designed based on carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) with exponential backoff. When an IEEE 802.15.4 device has very small backoff, it takes higher priority to get the channel compared to the other conventional IEEE 802.15.4 devices. This obviously degrades the network throughput performance of normal IEEE 802.15.4 devices. This paper presents the analysis of the impacts and proposes the method for detecting the malicious selfish backoff attacker via logistic classification.},

However, basically, qubits are very vulnerable to errors, thus a quantum error correction code (QECC) is needed to build a reliable quantum computer. Moreover, simply using QECCs is not sufficient in order that a quantum computer can tolerate errors. In quantum computation, each operation must be performed on the encoded states. Even when the gates used to perform these operations are noisy, the quantum computation must be tolerable to the errors. This is called fault-tolerant quantum computation and it is an essential condition for implementing a quantum computer. However, considering the fault tolerance, the overhead of the quantum computer increases exponentially. In this paper, we introduce fault-tolerant quantum computation and schemes to reduce the its overhead.},

In addition, it is of increasing interest to researchers, which a group of drones are networked and coordinated to accomplish a mission delivered from Ground Control Station (GCS). To support those service scenarios, communication path should be maintained between GCS and the UAVs, and the UAVs should be able to exchange a message among themselves. However, communication range between GCS and the UAVs is bounded according to the transceiver power and its sensitivity. Hence, a multihop network approach need to be considered. In such multihop networks, routing protocol plays an important role. Accordingly, in this paper, we present a geolocation-based routing protocol for Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs) with multihop network communication. Our protocol shows robust and resilient performance to the dynamic multihop network topology. A network topology composed of UAVs is highly dynamic due to the high speed of UAVs while executing missions. In this circumstance, our protocol uses geolocation information of neighbors and then find the routing path to the destination by only considering the neighbor information, which in turn, results in low overhead and robustness to the dynamic network topology in FANETs. We also provide implementation of the proposed geolocation-based routing protocol and testbed environments.},

For operation in low atmospheric densities, coaxial helicopters are best suited and they are capable of handling manoeuvres due to their small footprints and ease of operation. However, the dynamics of the helicopter is coupled in lateral axes which need to be compensated for precise control. The present solutions include vision-based tracking in order to decouple the dynamics, which needs additional hardware. In this paper, a decoupling controller is presented that employs an accelerometer-based force feedback system for measuring the undesired forces in off-axis which does not need any additional hardware. The simulation results indicate that the force feedback methodology is very effective in controlling the off-axis drift of the coaxial helicopter.},

The key parameters of IEEE 802.11p were implemented in Veins Framework combined with Omnet++ network simulator and SUMO Mobility simulator, to accurately simulate VANETs. The performance of this standard was measured in Veins Framework using realistic vehicular mobility models. Then, the main performance metrics; Timeliness, Throughput and Packet Loss Ratio were analyzed when varying the different messages sizes in the scenario. and Then a rebroadcasting process was analysed when varying the number of nodes.},

  abstract = {The highway junction point, where the ramp is merged with the mainstream, is the main traffic congestion point in the highway when handling transport demands. A vehicle driving on the ramp generally attempts to enter the highway without predicting the traffic condition, and commonly causes traffic congestion on highways. Traffic congestion in the highway junction is defined as the traffic situation that the transport demand in the conjunction point exceeds the bottleneck capacity and the accumulated demand remains to the bottleneck. Under traffic congestion, vehicles driving on the ramp cannot efficiently enter the highway. As a result, the waiting time of the vehicle on the ramp becomes long, and fuel consumption and CO2 emission increase due to the frequent acceleration and deceleration. In this paper, we propose a vehicular speed acceleration advisory algorithm for the vehicle on the ramp at the junction point. By recognizing the traffic condition on highways using V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication, the proposed algorithm helps to reduce the frequent acceleration and deceleration by drivers. From the simulation results, compared to the conventional driving on the ramp, we show that the proposed algorithm can decrease fuel consumption, CO2 emission under various vehicle densities.},

Light-fidelity (Li-Fi) and optical camera communications (OCC) are two latest technologies which use LED as transmitter, with PD and camera as receivers, respectively. Currently, Li-Fi is emerged as highly promising as it supports high data rate and security. But it suffers from some limitations, e.g., short communication distance, low signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) etc. OCC can overcome these limitations, but it only supports lower data rate. Therefore, to provide proper solution, we propose a hybrid OCC/Li-Fi system. We are not going to use both the technologies at the same time, rather access point is selected based on fuzzy logic, considering different application scenarios. Furthermore, at the end of this paper, the performance of the selection mechanism is discussed briefly.},

However, such optimized rerouting decisions must be made after the link failure situation has been confirmed. The mechanisms that confirm such link failure situations require a certain amount of processing time which may introduce a bottleneck in the performance. This paper proposes an enhanced approach that employs a mechanism to make the re-routing decision without the confirmation of link failure. The approach uses the OpenState Pipeline to manage the network in failure situations, and the experiment results show notable enhancements in packets loss rate and usage of Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM).},

The first is to reduce hardware management-related issues when working with complex networks, such as a lack of flexibility and scalability with regard to global configuration changes. The second is to create a communication library that provides programmable network function virtualization, helping to achieve the first aim. Specifically, we target low-cost, security-oriented networks that use broadband routers as L3 switches. When such networks have multiple IP domains between the external gateway and internal networks, domains that are lower in the hierarchy become more secure, but at the cost of flexibility. Our proposed system architecture aims to increase communication flexibility in such networks without requiring complex encapsulation and achieves this goal via a practical method that does not change the packet size. Finally, we conduct tests using an experimental implementation of the system, demonstrating its scalability.},

To satisfy rapidly evolving and newly emerging services, PON devices have to be evolved in order to make them adaptable to the always changing requirements while facilitating energy-saving operations. In this paper, we propose an adaptive software-defined (SD) ONU energy-saving mechanism. We propose to enhance the standard PON devices with advanced SDN capabilities so that an SD-controller can practice its global network knowledge to orchestrate an independent energy-saving mechanism for ONU's receiver (Rx) and transmitter (Tx) via the assignment of Rx sleeping duration and Tx wake-up threshold, respectively. In low traffic condition, the proposed mechanism can reduce the ONU's transmitter active time up to 98\% while still guaranteeing the QoS requirements. We provide system performance evaluation in terms of average delay, throughput, and energy-saving improvement.},

  abstract = {With the help of distributed link state routing protocols, IP networks are highly reliable and robust. However, routing in IP networks are relatively inflexible. Flows can follow only shortest paths toward their destinations. In contrast, Software Defined Networking (SDN) offers finegrained control over routing, at the expense of controller overhead, failover latency, and deployment challenges. The best choice is to combine both approaches to achieve ``central control over the distributed route computation'' paradigm. Recently a new idea called Fibbing is proposed to realize flexible fine-grained control in conventional IP networks. Fibbing as an alternative loop-free destination based solution brings the flexibility for traditional networks without changing router configurations and/or protocols. The Fibbing controller can steer a traffic flow to follow any specific route. However, how to achieve traffic engineering through dynamic traffic monitoring and route computation is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a framework to achieve an optimized load balancing solution for a Fibbing controlled network. In our system, there are a light weight traffic monitoring module, a demand estimation module, and an optimization engine for routing path computation. The system periodically determines a set of routing paths to the Fibbing controller for path provisioning. In order to evaluate the performance, we have implemented the whole system in a testbed. The experimental results show that the average time for file transfer is significantly reduced with the support of the proposed system.},

  abstract = {License Assisted Access-WiFi (LAA-WiFi) coexistence allows the operations on the unlicensed spectrum for Long Term Evolution (LTE) along with existing unlicensed wireless local area networks (WLANs). The current spectrum access process of legacy WLANs uses clear channel assessment (CCA) and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), where the spectrum is sensed before use and a random binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanism is employed for collision avoidance. While LAA uses a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism, moderately similar to the CCA CSMA/CA for channel access. However, there is a fairness issue when these two technologies coexist. In this paper, we propose a channel observation-based LBT (CoLBT) mechanism for fairness in LAAWi-Fi coexistence scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a more realistic practical channel observation-based collision probability observed by the LAA evolved Node B (eNB) to adaptively scale-up and scale-down the backoff contention window for channel contention, to reduce the waste of resources and improve LAAWiFi coexistence performance. Simulation results validate that the proposed CoLBT mechanism is effective in LAA-WiFi coexistence scenario and can improve fairness performance, compared with the current mechanism of LBT.},

The NFV orchestrator defined by ETSI is designed as a central unit and therefore includes the possibility of a single point of failure. Due to the environment of a disaster, a WMN node hosting this centralized orchestrator might get destroyed at events such as aftershocks resulting in a breakdown of the NFV infrastructure as it cannot be maintained and orchestrated anymore. To eliminate this aspect, requirements for a distributed NFV orchestration are defined. The requirements are categorized into architectural and orchestration specific aspects and are derived from the characteristics of a WMN and the conditions of a disaster environment. A concept for realizing a distributed NFV orchestration in a WMN-based disaster network according to the defined requirements is presented. The architecture consists of five logical layers with each layer fulfilling a specific functionality.},

  abstract = {In the Internet today, learnt prefixes are forwarded within autonomous systems (ASs) over internal Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP) sessions. Existing schemes for iBGP routing include the full-mesh (FM) solution, route reflection (RR) solution and confederation. Optimal prefix routing and route diversity are the main strength of the FM solution. However, it is rarely employed in a large networks due to its poor scalability. The RR scheme solves the scalability challenge at the cost of FM optimality due to Route Reflector's partial view of the network. The concept of Software Defined Networking (SDN) entails decoupling of the control plane from the forwarding plane such that the control plane is logically centralized benefiting from an overall knowledge of the network for decision making. In this work, we propose a solution based on multicasting which employs relay nodes in the iBGP message dissemination. The relay nodes are elected and act as boundaries of multicast groups, relaying and filtering prefixes into other multicast groups. We evaluate the use of single and multiple relay nodes per multicast group. Our solution brings session management scalability and minimization of duplicate prefix announcement through elimination of peer sessions deemed unnecessary. SDN controller is employed to configure and coordinate the multicast tree.},

  abstract = {The automotive industry has recently introduced Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for safety and better driving. Many Electronic Control Units (ECUs) have been installed in the vehicle to support ADAS, and massive data stream flows over the in-vehicle network. Therefore, the Ethernet backbone, which can guarantee the high bandwidth, has emerged as an in-vehicle communication technology. However, security on automotive Ethernet has not yet been proposed. The IEEE MACsec with IEEE 802.1X Authentication and Key Management (AKM) may be applied for the in-vehicle secure communication, but it has a constraint that its security scope is based on a point-to-point approach. Whenever a frame arrives at the switches in the transmission path, the decryption and reencryption of the frame are repeated. It may adversely affect the performance of ADAS related to the driver's safety by increasing the end-to-end latency. We therefore propose a new MACsec extension over the Software-Defined Networks (SDN) for an invehicle secure communication, which is based on IEEE 802.1X authentication mechanism. The proposed scheme extends the security scope of MACsec from point-to-point to end-to-end by delegating AKM process of ECUs and switches to SDN controller. It could minimize the cryptographic processes of the ECUs and switches without any modification of the existing MACsec standard, and could protect an automotive system from any manipulation by unauthorized third parties. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is applicable for an invehicle secure communication.},

This programmability allows the development of a plethora of third-party applications that can be used by network administrators in order to implement different networking functionalities. However, this programmability also induces various threats regarding potential malicious activities against the SDN networks. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of an SDN security mechanism that helps in the detection of malicious activities that might target the SDN network. The design we are proposing leverages the benefits of centralized control and programmability of SDN in order to periodically monitor the system calls utilization of the different SDN applications installed and statistically correlates such information to the baseline/benchmark information, thus detecting the existence of an unusual activity or a malicious application.},

They separate the network elements into edge switches and core switches. Edge switches tag a label onto packet header, and core switches use this label to perform lookup. In this paper, we propose a scheme called Path\_label switching. In this scheme, core switch only uses one field to perform lookup. In order to reduce the number of rules in edge switches, we encode the output port number of the last hop into MPLS field. We also propose a scheme to minimize the number of rules in fat-tree topology. In our scheme, the number of rules in core and aggregation switches is the same as the number of ports. We use Mininet to construct the experiments. We will show that our proposed scheme needs much less number of rules than other methods in leaf-spine and fat-tree topologies.},

To determine the mood vector of a music piece, a Support Vector regressor is created for arousal and valence each using features of a music piece. Then, the regressors predict a mood vector. To map a mood tags to its mood vector, we investigate the relationship between them based on tagging data retrieved from Last.fm. To show the benefits of the proposed method, in this paper, we create a test set by using last.fm tags and their synonyms, and measure its retrieval performance over the keyword-based approach using the test set.

There have been many studies to classify sleep stages automatically using EEG signal.

We propose to use EMG signal in addition to EEG signal to improve the accuracy of sleep stage classification. EMG signal is useful for classifying REM stage and Non-REM stages.

  abstract = {U-Bus Air is a wireless communication standard for metering systems, targeting gas supplies with a multi-hop network function. As a multi-hop wireless network, U-Bus Air gathers meter reading information connected to a monitoring center. The terminal with the function of connecting to a monitoring center is called a gateway (GW). The multi-hop function is used to connect GWs; this reduces the cost of connecting wide-area wireless networks. However, the order of installing a new terminal is random because it is determined by timing of replacement on meter in individual homes on meters in individual homes. As a result, the installing location of GWs cannot be specified in advance. Consequently, any created network topology will exhibit redundancies, such as unnecessary GWs, or generate many small networks. In this paper, we propose two different redundancy reducing methods that use information of terminals on cloud to reconstruct a network topology. The proposed methods consists of three steps: gathering information, emulating the topology to reduce redundancy using cloud, and providing feedback to rebuild information of each smart meter. We perform a computer simulation to evaluate the packet delivery ratio (PDR) and the reduction ratio of the number of GWs. We confirm that the redundancy can be reduced by using the proposed methods without affecting the performance of the network topology.},

  abstract = {In Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks, we faced a lot of challenges such as long propagation delay, and high packet loss. However, a flooding based routing protocol can address these challenges with its multipath characteristics. If the network uses a flooding based routing protocol, not only DATA but also ACK messages are transmitted through multiple paths. Although the messages are transmitted through multiple paths, we cannot avoid the packet loss completely. So, in order to provide high reliability of delivering messages, we need a retransmission mechanism. Though, if the network uses conventional transport layer protocol such as TCP, it will cause a spurious retransmission problem because it was not designed for the multipath environment. To overcome this problem, we suggest Path Similarity based Spurious Retransmission Minimization over Flooding based Routing in UWSN. Through our simulations, we verified that our scheme achieves the performance improvements of 10\% \textasciitilde{} 45\% in terms of retransmission ratio and 20\% \textasciitilde{} 36\% in terms of throughput compared to the Jacobson's RTO algorithm.},

Therefore, in this paper we intend to design a hybrid D2D discovery mechanism and evaluate its performance.

The BSNBSF aims to select the best near-far user pair, whose data transmission is the most robust against the interception of an eavesdropper. In order to facilitate the performance analysis of the proposed user scheduling scheme in terms of secrecy outage probability (SOP), we derive an exact closed-form expression and a tight approximate closed-form expression for the SOP of the selected near and far users, respectively. Numerical results show that the BSNBSF scheme significantly improves the secrecy outage performance NOMA networks compared to that of the random near user and random far user selection scheme. Additionally, discussions on the complicate convex characteristic of the total SOP with respect to the power allocation coefficients and the impact the number of near and/or far users are provided.},

  abstract = {In overlay hierarchical cognitive radio (HCR) networks, the primary system (PS) and the secondary system (SS) can cooperate to exploit the spectrum resource more efficiently. In this paper, we propose a new HCR, in which an energy harvesting (EH) device is additionally deployed at the primary receiver (PR) such that the PS can not only share the spectrum resources with the SS, but also harvest energy from the SS, achieving a new simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) paradigm. In the considered structure, the secondary base station (SB) can help relay the PS's signal via an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol, and a power splitting EH device is adopted at the PR. A cooperative strategy is proposed for maximizing the efficiency of the information and power transfer. We optimize two precoders at the SB (for the PS and SS, respectively) and the power splitting factor for the PR. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, it is a real challenge. To facilitate the optimization process, a precoding structure is first proposed to reduce the number of parameters. The resultant optimization problem can then be equivalently solved using a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach. Numerical results show that the proposed strategy provides a promising improvement for information and energy cooperation, as compared with existing methods.},

Therefore, a frequency-hopping wireless modulation and demodulation system can be constructed by using an RF communications trainer and a spectrum analyzer. In this study, we constructed a frequency-hopping transmission system using the RF communications trainer, GRF-1300, and the spectrum analyzer, GSP -730. To validate this system, we evaluated the peak frequency detection probability and compared it with theoretical values. Results show that, when the hopping time interval was larger than or equal to 2000 ms, the peak frequency detection probability almost coincided with the theoretical values.},

At present, most of the existing sensing schemes are proposed in Gaussian noise. Nevertheless, in practice, CR suffers from non-Gaussian noise such as man-made impulsive noise, ultra-wideband interference and co-channel interference. In this article, to handle the detection performance degradation in non-Gaussian impulsive noise environments, a robust spectrum sensing scheme namely hyperbolic tangent based energy detector (HT-ED) is proposed. The proposed HT-ED is a semi-blind method which does not require any a priori knowledge about the primary user's signals. Furthermore, the HT-ED can provide a superior detection performance compared with the conventional energy detector (ED) in a wide range of non-Gaussian noises. The simulation results show that the proposed HT-ED is very robust against impulsive noises which are modeled as the Laplace or {$\alpha$}-stable noises. Moreover the detection performance of HT-ED is much better than those of the traditional ED and FLOM-based methods.},

However, there is a disadvantage that the execution speed of the application program is very slow compared to the native code due to the characteristics of the virtual machine. Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation is a technique that precompiles bytecodes into native code to speed up execution of virtual machines. In this paper, we design the AoT compilation system for IoT-Cloud virtual machine system. The designed system is suitable for the convergence environment of the IoT and the cloud. Since only a portion of the bytecode is compiled into native code, the memory load of the virtual machine required for loading native code is reduced.},

  abstract = {Along with the steady growth of wired and wireless networks, the various new attacks targeting networks are also constantly emerging and transforming. As a efficient way to cope with various attacks, the Random Forest(RF) algorithm has frequently been used as the core engine of intrusion detection because of the faster learning speed and the higher attack detection accuracy. However, the RF algorithm has to input the number of the tree composing the forest as a parameter. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm that limit the number of trees composing the forest using the McNemar test. To evaluate the performance of the proposed RF algorithm, we compared learning time, accuracy and memory usage of the proposed algorithm with the original RF algorithm and other algorithm by using the KDDcup99 dataset. Under the same detection accuracy, the proposed RF algorithm improves the performance of the original RF algorithm by as much as 97.76\% at learning time, 91.86\% at test time, and 99.02\% in memory usage on average.},

  abstract = {Research related to electric vehicles (EVs) is mainly focused on hardware such as battery charging method, and there is still a lack of software (service oriented) research such as billing system that needs to be developed realistically. The result of the charge measured in the charging EV can be different from the charge amount claimed to be charged in the charging station. This is because the charge is measured separately from each other using its smart meters. And if mechanical measurements are assumed to be accurate, it is possible to lie in one of the EV or charging station. Also, billing information can be manipulated. To prevent those problems, this paper proposes the blockchain based billing system. The EV and the charging station store the billing information in the blockchain after mutual authentication and prevent the modification. A blockchain is the system in which all nodes have the same ledger, therefore cannot be tampered with. This prevents a user from modifying the record after charging.},

Every smart device in IoT consists of a power source sensors, microprocessor and transceiver module to sense, communicate and exchange data among each other. In distributed IoT networks, the energy efficiency of the smart objects is a key factor in the overall network performance. Most of the times IoT's have to deal with low power and communication disconnection due to the limited memory, processing capability, and power. Few techniques for stringent Quality of Service (QoS) routing in IoT have been proposed despite its great impact on future network. In this paper, we propose energyefficient possibilistic routing based on fuzzy logic model for IoT to controls the transmission of the routing request packets to increase the network lifetime and decrease the packet loss. The proposed fuzzy logic controller accepts the input descriptors in routing metrics to optimize the network performance. The proposed algorithm adopts energy-efficient possibilistic routing by using fuzzy inference rules to merge energy aware metrics for choosing the optimal delivery path. In the simulations, we verify that the proposed algorithm has longer IoT network lifetime and consumes the residual energy of each smart node more consistently when compared with the existing traditional protocols.},

In this paper we propose a technique to predict the event of handover and blind spots in order to allow the implementation of anticipatory techniques, where connection resources are reallocated or video buffers are filled with lowdefinition video frames before the connection gets lost. The prediction is based on a machine-learning approach, where the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is monitored and an upcoming handover is recognized by the pattern of the RSSI over time. Since a number of impairments (different paths followed by the user, different movement speed, fading, noise) affect the RSSI evolution, we resort to a neural-network to learn the peculiarities of each handover and solve the pattern recognition problem.},

Edge and core clouds provide computing, storage, and networking resources to serve as a generic computing platform. Network slicing techniques offer an effective way to boost various types of services, such as delay-sensitive or computationally intensive application, that are deployed ondemand in a shared resource infrastructure. This study proposes a resource management mechanism to optimize the quality of experience (QoE) of users in terms of the delay gap tolerance. The Min-Fit algorithm is a heuristic-based solution that flexibly chooses a server that has the maximum remaining CPU resources for satisfying user requirements. A mathematical model is formulated for 5G slicing capabilities to optimize the delay gap using a resource management approach to achieve QoE. Some computational experiments are demonstrated as performance evaluations for verifying the suitability of our proposed approach in terms of slicing capabilities. The results show that our approach outperforms other algorithms, which have larger delay gaps.},

The test system uses several single board computers (SBC) with an external Wi-Fi adapter (USB), 19 SBCs are sniffing nodes (SFN) and one SBC as sending node (SN). The sniffing SBCs are placed in a cycle around the sender so that every node has the same chance to receive the simulated packets from the SN. For the control of all 20 SBCs, a self-developed software is used, which connects from the host to the clients and is used for configuring the experiments. The configuration is sent to each client and will initiate their start, so that their times are also synchronized, for this all clients are synchronised using a time server.},

Edge Computing for mobile networks is a new technology which is currently under standardization providing an IT service environment and cloud-computing capabilities at the edge of the mobile network in close proximity to the mobile end users. The aim of this technology is to reduce latency, ensure highly efficient network operation and service delivery, providing improved user experience. All of these can be translated into value and can create opportunities for operators, application and content providers enabling them to better utilize the mobile broadband capabilities. Furthermore, edge computing enables a new value chain for end users but also for industries allowing to efficient deliver their applications over the mobile network providing fresh business opportunities and new use cases. FEC is a feedback free error recovery method where the sender introduces redundant data in advance with the source data enabling the recipient to recover from different arbitrary packet losses. Recently, the adoption of FEC error control method has been boosted by the introduction of the powerful RaptorQ Application Layer FEC (AL-FEC) codes. In this work we propose the integration of ALFEC error protection application at the edge layer. We propose a novel AL-FEC application architecture scheme based on RaptorQ codes and we analyze the performance enhancements such an error control architecture can introduce on Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN)-edge computing integrated systems.},

In this paper we consider a scenario with a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas serving four users, clustered into two groups of two users each, equipped with a single antenna. This simple but relevant scenario allows to capture the main features of NOMA systems, where in each cluster the user having the best channel applies successive interference cancellation (SIC) to remove the signal intended for the other user in the same cluster, while the other user treats interference as noise. Moreover interference among the two clusters also is treated as additional noise. In this scenario we address the problem of beamformer design and power allocation for the four users with the aim of minimizing the total transmit power while satisfying a minimum rate constraint for each user. Starting from the zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) beamformers we propose five solutions based on suitable combinations of fixed beamformers to simplify the beamformer design and power allocation. The performance of the proposed solutions is compared in terms of total consumed power and complexity of the various solutions.},

  abstract = {Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) has emerged as a promising network architecture for 5G cellular networks. The conventional base station is broken down into a Remote Radio Head (RRH) and a Base Band Unit (BBU). The RRHs are geographically scattered across multiple sites, whereas the BBUs are sheltered in a data center. In this context, deciding to which RRH users connect is known as the user association problem. As a function of network load conditions, some RRHs may be turned off, reducing network power consumption. Furthermore, RRHs may be mapped to a single BBU, achieving statistical multiplexing gain. Deciding what RRHs are grouped together is known as the RRH clustering problem. Traditionally, user association and RRH clustering are independently addressed. As these two problems are mutually dependent, we provide in this paper a framework for the joint optimization of the user association and the RRH clustering. Our objective is to minimize both the network power consumption and the total transmission delay. As this problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem, it can be solved through exhaustive search. However, the computational complexity becomes intractable as the network size increases. Therefore, we decouple our joint problem into two sub-problems. These sub-problems are iteratively solved until convergence. We further evaluate the performance of our proposed solution. Simulation results show that our optimal solution for the RRH clustering sub-problem outperforms the no-clustering solution, where one BBU is exclusively dedicated to each RRH, and the grand coalition solution, where all RRHs are associated with a single BBU.},

The use of higher-order modulation such as 256-QAM is an also important technique under consideration for 5G. In this paper, we propose superposed modulation using QPSK and 256-QAM for downlink NOMA, and demonstrate the performance by linklevel simulation under static propagation condition. The BER performance is investigated for the ``superposed QPSK and 256QAM'' transmission as parameters of power allocation sets. From these results, we clarify the requirements for paired NOMA UEs when the superposed QPSK and 256-QAM is used in downlink NOMA.},

VMP is the process of selecting the most suitable physical machine (PM) to host the virtual machines (VMs). Typically, the placement goal falls under one of the following optimization criteria: the maximization of the PM usage or power consumption efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming model (MOMILP) aiming at simultaneously minimizing the VM rejection ratio, the resource wastage and the number of used PMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which combines such objectives in a Multi-Objective model. We also assume heterogeneous configuration for the data center which has been proven, through recent research work and industrial experience, to be more costeffective for some applications especially those with intensive Input/Output (I/O) operations. To assess the performance of the proposed model, a comparative study has been curried out. Through the simulation results, it was observed that the proposed model achieves total gains reaching 35\% and 10\% in terms of resource wastage and power consumption respectively. It was also reported that the power consumption is not only impacted by the number of used PMs but also by the selected PM configurations.},

  abstract = {Internet embedded sensor nodes have attracted the attention of researchers and industry due to their wide application. The main standard, IEEE802.15.4e 2012, introduces a deterministic and synchronous multi-channel extension (DSME) model. Three main issues should be tackled and improved with this model; a high energy consumption of end nodes during the contention access period (CAP), a long association and guaranteed time slot (GTS) earning times during a network initialization phase and a long network discovery time. These issues have been analysed and improved in a star topology wireless sensor network (WSN). Four scenarios with different numbers of nodes are investigated. Nodes numbers are set according to network saturation ratios (25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%). This paper proposes three enhancements for the performance of this model. Two new approaches are proposed to reduce the energy consumption of end nodes during the CAP period, a new association scheme during network initialization phase using a tight TDMA algorithm to minimize the time required for association and getting a GTS slot and reduce power consumption due to collisions, and a new technique to reduce network discovery time. Simulation results show significant improvements in reducing energy consumption and radio duty cycle (RDC) of end nodes by a factor of (71) and (77) respectively. Good improvements are also achieved in reducing association and GTS earning times by a factor of (8) on average. Finally, network discovery time has been reduced for fast association and further energy saving of end nodes.},

  abstract = {In Wireless Sensor Networks, preserving energy is very important to prolong the sensor node's life. Duty cycle mechanism could preserve the node's energy by providing active and sleep period. However, the uncontrolled duty cycle may affect the delivery rate due to its inconsistency of relay participation in multi-hop packet forwarding. We have observed the effect of duty cycle mechanism to deliver data with a broadcast flooding; which we know that flooding is a fundamental network service for disseminating data. From our observation, controlling a contention window size based on node's density takes an important part in reducing packet collision that leads to a good packet delivery rate. However, in a congested traffic, controlling contention window size based on node's density is not enough because the incoming packet may be congested in packet buffer which is resulting to a packet dropping. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid-based packet forwarding to increase the reliability of transmission by controlling the number of contention window size based on the node's density and packet buffer information. To preserve the energy of the nodes, we also implemented the probability-based broadcast to suppress the number of unnecessary traffic. We compared our work with broadcast flooding, adaptive contention window size, and distance-based broadcast. From our experiment, Hybridbased packet forwarding achieved the best performance in packet reception rate and can control the unnecessary traffic better than others.},

One example is the weak formulation of the load-balancing routing problem, which solution can be used to route information. Hence, a routing algorithm, the distributed Gauss-Seidel iteration (DGSI), was proposed to coordinate sensors to solve the weak formulation iteratively. In this paper, we propose the atomic red-black distributed Gauss-Seidel iteration with finite element method (ARB-DGSI-FEM) to eliminate the early termination problem of DGSI due to the presence of holes, and thus improve the accuracy of numerical solutions. In addition, ARB-DGSI-FEM allows the values of unknowns to be updated in the red-black order to achieve the maximum degree of parallelism and reduce the convergence time. Our simulation results reveal that ARB-DGSI-FEM significantly improves the parallelism without too much sacrifice of accuracy.},

Human beings have ventured into the era of a network with the rise of all kinds of networks such as the Internet and Social networks. Detection of community structure in real networks is vital in terms of both theoretical and practical value. Many community detection methods are derived from specific backgrounds and their reliability is still questionable. Researchers hardly focus on the general definition of communities and the general community detection algorithms. The discrepancy between the two might pose some obstacles to the optimization of them so that it is hard to use one algorithm to perfect the other. Recently, Lu et al. [1] have proposed a general method for constructing network model from the real-world problem. Also, they have given a general definition of community structure as well as a complete procedure for detecting communities. In this paper, we apply the efficient resistance distance function [2] on Lu et al.'s algorithm and compare its performance with other community detection algorithms that allow for overlaps.},

An extensive evaluation is carried out for the performance of these combinations in different dynamic network settings. The results show that in most cases, Kademlia achieves its best performance when layered over AODV. However, OLSR-based Kademlia outperforms AODV in terms of delay and network load.},

We propose a valuation function formulation for participating buyers to respect user QoS requirements, and we introduce a game mechanism with unit demand buyers and myopic bidding strategies that encourages traffic offloading. Furthermore, we investigate the ordering of distinct users that provides an approximation to socially efficient outcomes. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and show significant rate gains for cell edge users.},

Softwaredefined networking and network function virtualization techniques support dynamically assigning computing resources into servers of the core and edge clouds. In this paper, an adaptive broadcast algorithm is proposed for blockchain authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. The cryptography is propagated throughout the Internet by using a broadcast mechanism. The broadcast message may incur a propagation delay and duplicate transmissions. The total propagation delay is assumed to be a combination of transmission time and computational time for data verification. A mathematical programming model is formulated to address the secure broadcast problem as a minimum spanning tree problem. The objective is to minimize the processing and transmission delay through reduced duplicate transmissions. Computational experiments demonstrate proof of concept to adopt blockchain techniques. The dynamic AAA architecture and path selection enable the blockchain operator to efficiently make decisions and achieve more secure services.},

The processing time of the L2S mapping becomes significantly reduced through the proposed method while the mean squared errors (MSE) between the actual block-error rate (BLER) from the linklevel simulator and the estimated BLER from the L2S mapping technique is also decreased, compared with the conventional L2S mapping method.},

  abstract = {Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is envisioned as promising 5G multiple access technology due to its throughput gain achieved through grouping mobile nodes having substantial difference in channel conditions and capability to serve large number of users simultaneously at same time, frequency, or code, but with different power levels. Furthermore, modifications in OFDM waveform for relaxed synchronization and supporting short burst communications for Internet of Things (IoT) devices has paved the way for Universal Filtered MultiCarrier (UFMC) waveform. However, a major disadvantage in deployment of Non-Orthogonal UFMC is the high Peakto-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) being comparable to that of OFDMA. As such, additional PAPR reduction techniques are required for reducing the dynamic range of power amplifier deployed in communication system. We take up Power Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) in which available power is sliced between users and investigate the performance of SC-FDMA for PDNOMA UFMC systems for PAPR reduction. UFMC is known to provide additional diversity to transmitter in uplink and facilitates relaxed synchronization at the receiver side in downlink scenario. Simulation results show that in flat-fading scenario, BER performance of proposed system is found to be significantly better than OFDM and UFMC. However, BER performance of proposed system in AWGN channel is seen to be traded off as the extent of SC-FDMA precoding increases. Also, increasing pilots per subband leads to increased PAPR with OFDM, UFMC whereas SC-FDMA for PD-NOMA UFMC system shows stagnation and significant comparative reduction in PAPR values.},

CayleyMenger determinant is mostly used when the beacon and deployed sensors are in the state of parallel planes. We have, however, proposed a mathematical model to compute the coordinates of the submerged sensors even when these sensors and beacon are in non-parallel state configuration. As the knowledge of precise coordinates of the sensors is as important as the collected data in underwater wireless sensor networks, the measure of exact distance between the nodes becomes the prime factor for improved accuracy. The proposed mathematical model of coordinate-determination has better immunity from multipath fading and linearization process of non-linear equations, resulting in more precise location of the sensors. Moreover, a single beacon is used to determine the coordinates of the sensor nodes where none of them have a priori knowledge about their locations.},

Since the WCV's energy consumption includes traveling and charging, our proposed algorithm aims to reduce the number of docking sites and optimize the WCV's traveling path, thus immensely decreasing the energy consumed during the WCV's movement and improving the scalability of charging scheduling. Finally, extensive simulation results show that, compared with state-of-the-art charging schedule algorithms, our algorithm can guarantee better performance in the number of docking sites and the length of traveling path.},

To eliminate the interference from the preceding packet, we introduce intra-flow interference canceller (IFIC).

  abstract = {There has been an increasing demand on providing seamless video streaming services. One of the major efforts to meet it is the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP(DASH) standard. However, its performance heavily depends on the client's adaptive quality selection algorithm that is not included in the standard. The existing conventional algorithms are basically based on a procedural algorithm that is not easy to capture and reflect all variations of dynamic network and traffic conditions in real network environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel quality selection mechanism based on the Deep Q-Network(DQN) model, the DQN-based DASH ABR(\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} ) mechanism. The proposed mechanism adopts a new reward calculation method based on five major performance metrics to reflect the current conditions of networks and devices in real time. The \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} system is implemented as a separate server that is connected via a high-speed LAN to the simulation host where the ns-3 DASH simulation software is performed. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism quickly selects a suitable quality even in high error rate environments, significantly reducing the frequency of quality change compared to the existing algorithm and improving the average quality during video playback.},

A lot of recent works have proved that an approach of caching at edge devices is efficient to reduce latency and alleviate backhaul load so that the probability to meet users' Quality of Service (QoS) is much higher. However, due to the selfishness of mobile users, it is hard to convince users to store contents for other users. In this regard, we consider the social connection between users in order to induce users to store contents for the social community. So, to implement the socially aware Device to Device (D2D) caching, we construct two types of graphs: i) physical D2D graph which is constructed based on users communication over D2D links and ii) logical social graph which is consist of a group of people who share the common interest. Then, we formulate socially aware D2D caching problem into Markov Decision Process (MDP). Additionally, we consider the distance and the social ties between users, and mobile devices' capacity to optimally store contents under the constraint that energy consumption of cellular link is much higher than D2D link. Finally, we solve the D2D caching problem by using Q-learning where the goal is to minimize the total energy consumption over Macrocell Base Station (MBS) and mobile devices.},

As it has to resort to the local optimal solution with hybrid beamforming with a limited number of RF chains, its performance turns out to be much worse than that of full digital beamforming.

One drawback of SDNs is the inability to survive when facing failures, in particular in large scale datacenter networks. Since SDN is programmable, flexible dynamic mechanisms could be designed to achieve fault tolerance. The paper studies the single master multiple slave controllers architecture to study fault tolerance. The paper proposes a Controller Adaptive Load Balancing (CALB) model for SDNs. CALB dynamically adapt the load of the master controller based on the current load at each slave controller. Mininet simulation tool is for the experimentation phase. Floodlight is used to implement the controllers. The key contribution of the paper is proposing a load balancing algorithm that the CALB is using to distribute the load among slave controllers based on a desired ratio. Experiments results were conducted using CALB in two scenarios: (1) Master controller is distributing switches among two slave controllers, and (2) master controller is distributing switches among three slave controllers. The paper uses throughput and response time for performance measurement. Results are promising as the performance increased 12\% in terms of the throughput and 9\% in terms of the response time when compared to a reference model Enhanced Controller Fault Tolerant fault tolerance technique (ECFT).},

In this short paper, we study the performance of a two-user uplink NOMA network under quality of service (QoS) delay constraints, captured through each user's effective capacity (EC). We propose novel closed-form expressions for the EC of the NOMA users, validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Interestingly, our study shows that in the high signal to noise ratio (SNR) region, the ``strong'' NOMA user is more penalized in terms of its EC under the same delay constraint as the ``weak'' user.},

However, it was shown that most of the previous SE schemes could reveal the client's queries even if they are encrypted, thereby leading to privacy violation. In order to solve the problem, several forward private SE schemes have been proposed in a single client environment. However, the previous forward private SE schemes have never been analyzed in multi-client settings. In this paper, we briefly review the previous forward private SE schemes. Then, we conduct a comparative analysis of them in terms of performance and forward privacy. Our analysis demonstrates the previous forward secure SE schemes highly depend on the file-counter. Lastly, we show that they are not scalable in multi-client settings due to the performance and security issue from the file-counter.},

In this paper, the performance of a LDPC code is evaluated in this harsh channel environment. At the same time, in order to improve the system performance further, an interleaving method in combination with a LDPC code is used to overcome the burst error problem, which frequently occurs in optical satellite communication systems (OSC).

To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we derive an exact closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the near user and a tight approximated closed-form expression for the SOP of the far user. Numerical results reveals that the proposed TAS scheme improves the total secrecy outage probability compared to that of some existing schemes. We also provide some insightful discussions on the impact of the number of antenna and the location of the eavesdropper on the security capability of the considered system.},

This paper introduces a system level simulator implementing the mmWave based backhaul network adopting IBFD. We evaluate achievable rates for two link settings. One is designed to minimize the number of selfinterference links and the other is designed to maximize the number of self-interference links. Then we verify that the IBFD can increase the acheivable rates of the mmWave based backhaul network. Also we evaluate the effect of link setting on the acheivable rates in the mmWave based backhaul network adopting IBFD.},

The proposed system generates parity by using a GPU, stripes parity at the initiator server and stripes data at the target server. We also apply an energy-aware scheduling scheme based on solid state disk\textendash{}based data storage and hard disk drive\textendash{}based parity storage. Experimental results show that the energy consumption by GPURAID is 45\% less than Linux-RAID.},

In order to deal with the surge of data traffic, the wired network already utilizes caches in efficient ways. In recent years, there has been ongoing research in wireless networks to add caches to devices to reduce the burden of the radio resource. While many devices can support only small-sized caches and limited-sized batteries, some devices such as cars and buses may be able to include large caches and can provide contents to other devices via device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this paper, we discuss D2D offloading using caches on mobile devices by exploiting the mobility of the devices.},

The divided secret data at the user can be reconstructed with a sufficient number ({$\geq$} T ) of parts by using the Lagrange interpolating polynomial.

LTE-R, which is currently under development in South Korea, provides the capability to send and receive data for group calls and emergency calls, as well as internal control calls on trains linked to smartphones. However, infrastructure construction and technical services are required to ensure seamless services as well as the quality of service (QoS) in a high-speed moving environment. The Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA) has established the LTE-R wireless communication standard to support these requirements; however, verification of the established data standard is necessary in an actual high-speed rail environment to ensure its reliability. This study measures the QoS through a mobile terminal in the LTE-R infrastructure network constructed by the Korea Railroad Research Institute in a high-speed moving environment (300 km/h to 350 km/h). The measurement results will be used as reference materials for LTE-R construction and research.},

However, the time reversal method requires a large-size receiver array to improve the communication performance, which results in the degradation of space efficiency. The vector sensor measures acoustic pressure signal as well as x, y, and zcomponents of the particle velocity at a single point, and these signals can be used as a single-input multiple-output system (SIMO) for underwater acoustic communication.

  abstract = {Ultra-high quality video streaming is expected to be the standard for multimedia in the next decade. However, it poses many problems with the current internet transmission technologies, such as network latency, stalling while a video is playing back. Researchers and network operators have spent much attention on solving such problems such as the latest video compression technique using for 4K and 8K video. In this article, we present another approach to improving ultra-high quality video streaming over the internet mainly focusing on mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, we propose an NFV-based MEC to transmit ultra-high quality multimedia efficiently. Besides, our proposed streaming system is dynamic adaptive streaming which supports streaming seamlessly with bandwidth fluctuation. As a result, our system provides 4K and 8K video streaming efficiently with lower latency up to 10\% compared to existing approaches.},

It is quite complex problem to solve the spectrum fragmentation. Fuzzy logic system that resembles human inference has been used for decision making for complex problem. In this paper, we propose the dynamic spectrum assignment (SA) algorithm for minimizing the fragmentation based on the fuzzy logic in EONs. To design fuzzy logic control system for the SA algorithm, we define spectrum fragmentation ratio(SFR) and time fragmentation ratio(TFR) for input membership. We also define the weight values of available spectrum blocks as output membership. The spectrum block with the minimum crisp value is selected for the spectrum assignment of connection request.

To solve this problem, a new optical transport network configuration solution must be studied. Therefore, the adoption of DWDM(Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) scheme, which is most advantageous for increasing the data capacity among the various optical communication network technologies proposed to date, is rapidly increasing.[1] However, because DWDM is advantageous in capacity, but requires a large number of wavelengths, DWDM SFP optical module inventory per channel can accumulate, leading to an increase in inventory costs.

Recently, both academia and industry are attracted to LoRaWAN because of its recent developments and applicability in the IoT environment. Mostly, the IoT concept involves massive end devices distributed over a wide topographical area, hence establishing a high density and large-scale environment. LoRaWAN makes use of six orthogonal spreading factors (SFs) in order to improve spectral efficiency and increase the capacity. In this paper, we focus on the LoRaWAN class A network end devices and the problem of network scalability under high-density urban environment by using both the confirmed and unconfirmed mode of communication. Simulation results show that the urban environment has a high impact on the distribution of SFs, thus leading to low network performance in terms of success ratio. We also observed that the use of acknowledgment limits the scalability of the LoRaWAN due to the duty cycle constraints. However, this study further reveals that elevating the antenna height can significantly improve the performance in an urban area.},

  title = {Drone-{{Assisted Inspection}} for {{Automated Accident Damage Estimation}}: {{A Deep Learning Approach}}},
  abstract = {Drones have been used in many application domains nowadays including traffic congestion control, weather information collection, disaster and rescue interventions, and surveillance operations. The drone adoption lies on their capabilities to collect images, videos as well as other sensory data from the air, stream this data to the cloud for processing, and analytics in order to derive important real-time decisions. In this paper, we propose a drone assisted inspection for accident damage estimation based on deep learning approach. Drones are automatically scheduled to visit the accident locations, and data is retrieved for further processing and analytics. We developed a two-phases damage estimation approach, where in the first phase we use deep learning approach to identify and classify objects from accident's images, and in the second phase we measure the size of damaged objects and we estimate the overall cost of the accident's damages. We evaluated our two-phase approach using data of various accidents, and the classification accuracy we have obtained vary between 0.79 and 0.94 and the accident's damage cost estimation most of time is 100\% accepted by the expert.},

However, an auxiliary communication link is indispensable for stable operation and mission execution of UAV even in areas where existing mobile communication networks can not cover. For stable operation of UAV, auxiliary communication link requires greater communication coverage and link availability than existing LTE mobile communication network. In that sense, it is difficult to use for the auxiliary communication link unlicensed band where there is the small power limitation and severe interference is suffered. Therefore, C-bands, which is allocated for UAV control and payload communication, could be good candidate.

To improve the QoS, we formulate a self-organizing resource allocation scheme using a stochastic algorithm for multicast D2D communication. Using the proposed algorithm, each uplink cellular resource can be simultaneously reused by the active D2D users in a network.

First, we take the image of LED array and segment the LED image by using LED detection algorithm. After segmenting the LED image, the LED image is resized in 10 by 10 dimension that means 100 pixels. Each pixel is the input to the BNN model for each RGB color channel. For studying the behavior of each color LED image in low (565 lux) and strong (2450 lux) environmental light intensity, we train our BNN model for low and strong environmental light intensity. Finally, we compare the performance of our BNN model with the regression analysis model at low and strong environmental light intensity. We obtain greater closeness accuracy for each color channel at both environmental light intensities.},

  abstract = {Indoor localization has been an active research field for decades, due to its wide range of applications. WiFi fingerprinting, which estimates the user's locations using precollecting WiFi signals as references, is of particular interest since these days, every user can easily access to WiFi networks. Among numerous methods, deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods have shown an attractive performance but their major drawback is the sensitivity to the fluctuation of received signals (caused by multipaths). To yield a satisfactory performance, thus, a sufficiently large number of possible cases should be trained, which costs a lot. In this paper, we address the above problem by presenting a convolutional neural network (CNN) based localization method. As success in image classifications, the proposed method can be robust to the small changes of received signals as it exploits the topology of a radio map as well as signal strengths. Via experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed CNN method can outperform the other DNN-based methods using publicly available datasets provided in IPIN 2015.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we have studied the multiple light source image sensing technology for high speed transmission in optical camera CCD sensor based visible light communication system. To improve transmission capacity in optical camera communications via image sensors, different data must be transmitted simultaneously from each LED. However, multiple LED light source environments for high-speed transmission can cause interference between adjacent LEDs. In this case, since the visible light communication system generally uses intensity modulation, when a plurality of LEDs transmit data at the same time, it is difficult to accurately detect the respective LEDs due to the light scattering interference of the adjacent LEDs. In order to solve these problems, we propose spectral estimation technique and pixel image signal processing technique for each LED. A threshold value is generated based on the center value of the spectrum at the center of each LED, and only the LED which is sensed above the reference value is recognized independently by the ISP. If the spectral level is below the center value, that LED is recognized as off because it is affected by the light spread of adjacent LEDs. This technique accurately recognizes multiple LED pixels and improves the total average bit error rate and throughput of the MISOOCVLC (Optical Camera Visible Light Communication) system.},

  abstract = {To populate IoT service, having remote control on a smart device is not enough. More complicated IoT services are needed by combining each IoT service, and enabling communication between independent services are essential to them. There are several solutions and services to provide interactivity between IoT services in the market such as IFTTT or Muzzley. However, most of these services are implemented on the cloud, which makes it difficult to get prompt response for application request. In this paper, a Service Mediation Gateway is proposed to improve connectivity between IoT services with less response time. The proposed gateway is located between IoT services and the application, just like an edge or fog device, and works as a data cache for IoT resources on the cloud. The proposed gateway can be implemented both on the cloud and on the edge, so that provide more prompt response to the application. The proposed gateway has been implemented with existing IoT services, and the comparison with existing cloud services is evaluated.},

The proposed technology secures a compatibility between devices related to high-speed data transmission. More specifically, even when devices that are inter-connected via cables are in different data transmission environments, at least one optimized link connection is set up between devices to ensure compatibility between new and existing devices.},

We propose a parallel learning method to reduce the error in the indoor height and an indoor positioning data augmentation method for data generalization. This method exhibits a higher performance than an existing Euclidean distance based positioning method. In particular, the data augmentation technique can be applied without depending on the specific positioning algorithm.},

The two-dimensional chaotic map is a structure with self-preserving properties, which moves the position of the pixel and encrypts the image. C-MLCA uses a maximum length PN sequence based on the properties of CA. The sequences with unpredictably complex rules create a basis image and the basis image is XOR-computed with the original image. That is, C-MLCA encrypts the image by changing the eigenvalues of the pixels through the computation process. Using these two features, we introduce an effective encryption method to overcome the limitations of the existing encryption methods. By comparing and analyzing the encrypted image with the original image, we were able to confirm that the proposed encryption method has a high level of stability and security.},

In densely populated areas this causes considerable interference amongst the APs since there are only three orthogonal channels. Downlink data throughput reduces due to co-channel and overlapping channel interference. Efficient channel selection is a significant problem due to the dynamic wireless environment. Our proposed Dynamic Channel Selection(DCS) algorithm selects the optimal channel based on the periodic scan of the environment by a co-located monitoring radio unit. Frequent switching of channels is also reduced to maintain the AP's performance and stability. It is an innovative solution, readily applicable to the existing WLAN standard not necessitating any change in IEEE 802.11 MAC Layer. Our results show an improvement of up to 35\% in the data throughput in six different real-time network scenarios.},

Therefore, it is important to have knowledge about software vulnerabilities in OSs for PLCs in order to prevent or mitigate them in PLC design and implementation. Many PLCs use Micrium uC/OS as their OS. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing and mitigating some software two vulnerabilities, buffer overflows and integer overflows in uC/OS.

CPS technology requires core technologies to ensure reliability, real-time, safety, autonomy, and security. CPS is the system that can connect between cyberspace and physical space. Cyberspace attacks are confused in the real world and have a lot of damage. The personal information that dealing in CPS has high confidentiality, so the policies and technique will needed to protect the attack in advance. If there is an attack on the CPS, not only personal information but also national confidential data can be leaked. In order to prevent this, the risk is measured using the Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) Model, which can measure risk by element for situational awareness in CPS environment. To reduce risk by preventing attacks in CPS, this paper measures risk after using the concept of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design(CPTED).},

In this paper, we present a hypervisor-level cache, called hyperCache, which is possible to provide a shortcut in KVM/QEMU by intercepting I/O requests in the hypervisor, while taking into account the I/O access frequency.

  abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) that is typical for the current fourth generation mobile communication system, is a multi-carrier modulation (MCM) system that enables high-speed communication using multiple carriers. The existing OFDM scheme that maps symbols to subcarriers using an inverse fast Fourier transform (iFFT) operation uses a cyclic prefix (CP) to reduce inter-symbol interference in a multipath channel, which is a disadvantage of power and spectral efficiency respectively. Therefore, this paper aims to complement the existing shortcomings for next generation high-speed communication and to design more efficient MCM system. The proposed system uses IDWT (inverse discrete wavelet transform) operation instead of iFFT operation used in conventional OFDM. A wavelet transform is an operation that filters a signal using wavelet and scaling basis functions. Therefore, we compared the bit error rate (BER), spectral efficiency, and peak to average power ratio (PAPR) performance with the conventional OFDM system through the design of OFDM system based on wavelet transform. As a result, the conventional OFDM and wavelet-OFDM exhibited the same BER performance, and wavelet-OFDM using the Discrete Meyer wavelet had the same spectral efficiency as the conventional OFDM. In addition, all systems of wavelet-OFDM based on various wavelets confirm PAPR performance lower than conventional OFDM.},

The core concept of ICN has been developed based on the content name instead of the content location information, intermediate content caching between the sender and the receiver, packet level security and others. To achieve the objective of ICN, different architectures were proposed and analyzed based on the criteria of ICN, however there are still remaining issues to be resolved. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based content management framework for ICN which enables content registration, distribution, retrieval, caching, routing, and security support. We also present simulation results to show that our framework works better than existing ICN types in terms of content transfer time.},

In the present army, the radar signal is classified according to the type of threats by referring to the library composed of radar signal parameters mostly built by prior investigations. Since radar technology is continuously evolving and diversifying, however, the library based method can not properly classify the signals for new threats which are not in the existing libraries, thus limiting the choice of appropriate jamming techniques. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the signals so that the optimal jamming technique can be selected by using only the parameter data of the radar signal. In this paper, we propose a method based on machine learning to cope with new threat signals of radars. The method classifies the radar signals according to the jamming method with convolutional neural networks, and does not refer to the preexisting library.},

Conventional obstacle recognition technologies using LiDAR and radar have caused serious accidents, because they fail to recognize objects accurately in bad weather and at night. In this paper, an infrared camera that can detect the heat is additionally introduced, so that the front car and the pedestrian are recognized in advance.

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide the excellent service on deep learning tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and pattern recognition. In the field of face recognition, researches using DNN have been carried out. However, face adversarial example is a serious threat in face recognition system. Face adversarial example adding a little of noise to the original face image can cause the misrecognition in the face recognition system. For example, an attacker intentionally modifies a face image with small distortion, which could cause the face recognition system to misidentify another person. It also shows the possibility of wrong recognition by another person when it is modulated by several points on the face. However, the concept of face friendsafe adversarial example can be useful in a military situation where friend and enemy forces are mixed. In the face recognition field, face friend-safe adversarial example may be needed that is correctly recognized by a friend face recognition system and misidentified by an enemy face recognition system. In this paper, we propose a face friend-safe adversarial example targeting the FaceNet face recognition system. The proposed scheme generates a face friend-safe adversarial example that is misrecognized by a enemy face recognition system but is correctly recognized by friend face recognition system with minimum distortion. For experiment, we used VGGFace2 and Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) as a dataset and Tensorflow as a machine learning library. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a 92.2\% attack succes rate and 91.4\% friend accuracy with only 64.22 distortion.},

In terms of stability, the single path transmission scheme has disadvantages in that it transmits data using only the preferred parent node and takes much time to recover the path in case of failure. Therefore, we propose a multipath scheduling scheme for energy balancing and reliable transmission over 6TiSCH WSN.},

Lately, face recognition has begun to be used for security applications at specific locations as well as for authentication. Face recognition for security purposes involves human and face detection based on the image created by a fixed camera. Consequently, the success rate for face recognition is low for lowresolution cameras. To address this problem, this study proposes a face recognition method in a multi-camera environment that includes both a fixed and a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera. The proposed method involves detecting humans within the fixed camera's field of view while tracking the detected person by adjusting the PTZ camera's pan and tilt to keep the person in view. By zooming simultaneously with tracking to obtain a high-resolution facial image, the proposed method outperformed conventional face recognition methods that use only a fixed camera.},

In order to improve transmission capacity in visible light communication, data must be transmitted from different LEDs at the same time and received. However, a system environment with multiple LEDs may cause interference between adjacent LEDs. Generally, since a visible light communication system generally uses a luminance modulation method, when a plurality of LEDs transmit data at the same time, it is difficult to accurately detect each LED due to light scattering interference of an adjacent LED. To solve this problem, we proposed a spatial filtering technique to group multiple LEDs and to reduce the interference of grouped LED matrix. We also propose a pixel image processing technique for detecting each LED. This technology accurately recognizes each matrix of LEDs in a multi-matrix LED environment and improves system performance by increasing the throughput of the MISO-OCVLC (Optical Camera Visible Light Communication) system.},

  abstract = {LoRa's long-range and low-power features have made it an attractive candidate for IoT devices in various fields. In this work, we present an enhanced LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN MAC protocol is characterized by the restrictive use of the channel, limited by the regulatory authorities to a 1\% duty cycle per cycle (i.e., 36 s per hour) per node. This regulation penalizes the nodes which require a channel access time greater than the limited duty cycle to occasionally transmit a large amount of data such as video surveillance or access control information in applications like smart school surveillance. However, some other nodes like environment sensors sharing a same LoRaWAN server may send very small amounts of information (e.g. temperature, humidity, ...) and under-use the authorized activity time of 1\% duty cycle. Hence the idea of implementing an activity time sharing mechanism among nodes that allows devices to borrow additional activity time from a device or set of devices that have completed the transmission of their packets and do not need the remaining time of the corresponding duty cycle. Our work extends and improves the activity time sharing mechanism initially proposed in [1]. Instead of FIFO sharing-time allocation based on a global activity time, which may lead to the starvation of the nodes that are others than that in the head of FIFO line, we propose a new time allocation algorithm based on the classification of the different requests according to their needs in terms of their QoS requirements. It allows to satisfy a larger number of nodes requiring extra time, with less control overheads while ensuring fairness. Our time-sharing algorithm has been implemented and tested on the wasp-mote chip of libelium, showing the performance improvement and its practical usability.},
