Abstract—The millimetre-wave(mmWave) based wireless backhaul operating in an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) mode is evaluated by system level simulation. This paper introduces a system level simulator implementing the mmWave based backhaul network adopting IBFD. We evaluate achievable rates for two link settings. One is designed to minimize the number of selfinterference links and the other is designed to maximize the number of self-interference links. Then we verify that the IBFD can increase the acheivable rates of the mmWave based backhaul network. Also we evaluate the effect of link setting on the acheivable rates in the mmWave based backhaul network adopting IBFD.
I. INTRODUCTION
To support the tens of gigabit-per-second (Gbps) data rates, the capability of backhaul becomes increasingly important not to be bottleneck in the cellular system. Recently, millimetrewave(mmWave) based backhaul network is considered as a promising technique, since the mmWave based backhaul is able to provide Gbps data rate and offer ﬂexible and costeffective solution for 5G backhaul networks [2]. To enhance the mmWave based system, many researches have been studied for transmission and reception techniques, such as massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO), hybrid beamforming, inband full-duplex (IBFD), etc [3]. Especailly the IBFD has been considered to increase sum capacity of mmWave backhaul network [4]. The adoption of IBFD in mmWave backhaul network is possible if the additional self-interference cancellation (SIC) of 35 to 50dB is supported by SIC techniques [5]. Fortunately, most of existing SIC techniques have cancellation capabilities above 50dB [4].
In this paper, we investigate the system-level simulation for mmWave based backhaul network adopting IBFD. We implement a system level simulator and evaluate the achievable rates on the assumption that SIC is provided and the power level of residual self-interference (SI) is equal to noise power level after the SIC procedure. We evaluate and compare the achievable rate performances of backhaul network adopting IBFD or not. We also evaluate the effect of link setting on the achievable rate performances.

II. SYSTEM MODEL A. Network layout and IBFD model
As described in Fig. 1, we consider a central BS group consisting of three BSs and one tiers of surrounding BSs. Each BS adopts 6 sectors. We consider time division duplex (TDD) mode for each link. Fig. 1 (a) shows the conventional link setting without IBFD. All sectors in a BS should conduct the same operation, transmission or reception, at the same time slot. Therefore, some links cannot be activated, although no SI is inside a BS. Fig. 1 (b) shows the link setting with IBFD. Each sector in a BS can operate in a transmission or reception mode independently at the same time slot. Therefore, all links in the backhaul network can be activated at the same time slot,

although SI occurs additionally inside a BS. Fig. 2 shows the desired and SI links among BS 0, BS
1 and BS 2 of two link settings for the mmWave backhaul network with IBFD. Fig. 2 (a) and (b) show the link settings to minimize the number of SI links and maximize the number of SI links, respectively.

B. Antenna model
We consider a uniform rectangular antenna array comprising Np panels per each sector and NH NV cross-polarized antenna elements per each panel, where NH and NV are the number of cross-polarized antenna elements in a row and a column, respectively. Then the total number of antenna elements can be calculated as Ne=2NP NHNV . It is assumed that all sectors use the same number of antenna elements for transmission and reception. The detailed antenna radiation pattern is referred from in [6].

C. Link measurement model

1) Signal model: For the transmission and reception model, we consider hybrid beamforming based MIMO-OFDM system. The analog beamforming is appiled per transceiver radio unit (TXRU) [7]. We consider Nru TXRUs per sector at transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). When Ns data streams (layers) are transmitted to a receiver, the received symbol vector of the lth subcarrier for the receiver of the kth link is given as

yk[l] =Gk[l]MTk VkT (Hk[l]WkMkPk[l]xk[l]

+ Hi[l]WiMiPi[l]xi[l] + n[l]),

(1)

i∈Ik

where yk[l] is an Ns × 1 baseband received symbol vector, Gk[l] is an Ns × Np digital equalization matrix, Mk is an Nru ×Np port virtualization matrix, Vk is an Ne ×Nru analog beamforming matrix at the receiver, Hk[l] is an Ne × Ne frequency domain channel matrix, Wk is an Ne × Nru analog beamforming matrix at the transmitter such that �Wk�2F = 1, Pk[l] is an Np × Ns digital precoding matrix such that �Pk[l]�2F = 1, xk[l] is an Ns × 1 baseband transmit symbol vector, n[l] is an Ns × 1 noise vector, and Ik is the set of interference link for the kth link. Ik can be divided into two groups, one for the SI links Ik,SI and the other for interBS-interference (IBI) links Ik,IBI . IBI refer to interference to
sectors in other BSs.

In this paper, we assume that SIC techniques are applying to

each BS and the SI can be cancelled to the noise power level.

We deﬁne SIC ratio as χ. Therefore, the power of residual SI can be expressed as (1 − χ)PT x, where PT x denotes the transmit power. Using the residual SI calculated by χ, (1) can

be rewriten as

We also consider the limited feedback based hybrid beamforming. The beam index (BI), precoding matrix index (PMI), channel quality indicator (CQI) and rank indicator (RI) are used to feedback the channel state information (CSI). For the analog beamforming, we employ the analog codebook as the uniform quantization in angle space deﬁned in [8]. For the digital precoding, we consider the LTE release 8 codebook supporting up to 4 layers [9]. The BI and PMI are determined based on the analog codebook and digital codebook, respectively. The MCS is determined based on the CQI and RI. We consider modulation to 1024-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and the MCS table is refered from Table I in [6].
2) Performance measurement: In this paper, we calculate the achievable rate of each link. To calculate the achievable rate of each link, we ﬁrst calculate CSI including BI, PMI, RI and CQI from channel response. The detailed procedure to obtain the CSI is referred from [6]. Based on the CSI, the precoding matrix, analog beamforming, modulation and coding rate are selected and we calculate the SINR per subcarrier from (2). From the SINR per subcarrier, we calculate effective SINR and achievable rate based on the mutual information based effective SINR mapping (MIESM) methed used in [10].
III. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we present system level simulation results. Simulation parameters for the simulations are listed in Table I. To observe the performance gains of IBFD according to link setting, we evlauate the achievable rates for three link settings, called as ’non-IBFD’, ’min SI link’ and ’max SI link’. The ’non-IBFD’ is described in Fig.1 (a) and ’Min SI link’ and ’Max SI link’ are described in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), respectively. The achievable rates are measured for the links among BS 0, BS 1 and BS 2 depicted in Fig.1.
Fig. 3 shows the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of achievable rate of each link. The CDFs for three link settings are similar to each other. The ’Min SI link’ has probability of 0.51 that a link has achievable rate under 3 bps/Hz. The

focused on the performance gains of IBFD for mmWave backhaul networks. We evaluated the achievable rates of mmWave backhaul network adopting IBFD and veriﬁed that the IBFD can increase the network capacity. Also we observed that the link setting should be determined with consideration for the number of SI links. The link setting algorithm for various deployments is required to increase the performances of IBFD.

’Max SI link’ and ’non-IBFD’ have probability of 0.55 that a link has achievable rate under 3 bps/Hz. Therefore, we can observe that the ’Min SI link’ has the ewer low-quality links than the other link settings.
Fig. 4 shows CDFs of the achievable sum rates and Table II shows the average acheivable rates for three link settings. The ’Min SI link’ and ’Max SI link’ outperform ’non-IBFD’ in terms of the achievable sum rates. In Table II, the average achievable sum rates of ’Min SI link’ and ’Max SI link’ are about 1.5 times higher than that of ’non-IBFD’. The performance gain is obtained by increase of number of desired link, since the number of measured links of ’Min SI link’ and ’Max SI link’ is 1.5 times lager than that of ’non-IBFD’. Also we observe that ’Min SI link’ has the higher achievable sum rates than ’Max SI link’. Therefore, the number of SI links should be decreased to increase the achievable rates of network.

IV. CONCLUSION
We have simulated the mmWave backhaul network by using a system level simulator. The IBFD, massive MIMO, limited feedback based hybrid beamforming and MCS up to 1024QAM are considered in the system level simulation. We
