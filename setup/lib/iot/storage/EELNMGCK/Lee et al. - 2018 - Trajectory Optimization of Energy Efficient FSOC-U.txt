Abstract—This paper address the issues of optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using free-space optical communication (FSOC). In particular, we examine how the beam divergence and the atmospheric attenuation of FSOC channel affect the ﬂight of energy efﬁcient UAVs. Especially based on geometric loss and also the effect of rain, snow, and fog on FSOC, we showed the energy efﬁcient trajectory of UAV.
I. INTRODUCTION
A unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be used as a mobile terminal communicating with other terrestrial equipment or with other aerial vehicles. The UAV can freely move in three dimensions, allowing the vehicle to communicate more ﬂexibly than ﬁxed terminals. Accordingly, UAV-assisted communication can be useful not only for the public but also for particular situations, such as defense or disaster issues. In particular, UAV-assisted free space optical communication (FSOC) is currently being actively researched for the purpose of providing internet access in areas with the insufﬁcient network connectivity. However, UAV has the limitation that it can not secure energy continuously. Therefore, it is necessary for the UAV to ﬂy energy efﬁciently for an application that requires a certain amount of operating time. In [1] and [2], energy efﬁcient UAV management scheme is proposed in the context of limited energy consumption.
Inspired by the above works on UAV communications, we solve energy efﬁcient UAV route optimization problems that consider FSOC channel characteristics, unlike [1] and [2] for RF channel. Especially, taking into account the beam divergence and atmospheric environment, we ﬁnd the energy efﬁcient trajectories of UAV more suited to the actual operating condition.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
It is important to note that we consider the energy efﬁciency in the discrete domain, to relax the inﬁnite number of variables caused by continuous movements of UAV. With energyefﬁciency objective function, we optimize the UAV trajectory. Considering mobility of UAV, this system sets the problem in three-dimensional space. We assume that ground terminal located on (0, 0, 0) and UAV ﬂies horizontally with a constant altitude H. Based on the discrete time step, t = nδt, n = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, the position vector is q[n] = [x[n], y[n]]T ,

and the distance between ground terminal and UAV is d[n] = H2 + �q[n]�2.
For energy consumption model, we use previously introduced upper bound of propulsion energy consumption model of ﬁxed-wing UAV [1] as follow,

which assumed with aT [n]v[n] = 0 and same initial, end

velocity v0 = vF . Note that energy for communication of

UAV is much smaller than energy for movement of UAV and

accordingly assumed to be negligible [2].

In this paper, the line-of-sight (LOS) link for FSOC is assumed and the multi-path is not considered. We note that the fading is not considered because we optimize the UAV trajectory prior to its operation. Accordingly, the channel gain is based on the path loss of FSOC depending on the position of the UAV.

An atmospheric loss in FSOC is mainly affected by beam

divergence and weather conditions [3]. To describe the atten-

uation due to the fog, rain, and snow, the three coefﬁcients

are expressed and β˜fog(λ)

attenuation by weather condition is determined as follows,

III. ENERGY-EFFICIENCY MAXIMIZATION

We optimize the energy-efﬁciency of UAV using FSOC, taking into account the actual operating environment. For this problem, we follow the solution to UAV energy-efﬁciency optimization problem using RF communication. However, the existing problem is expanded considering the inherent channel characteristics of FSOC.
Based on the Taylor approximation of velocities and acceleration formulas of UAV [1], we formulate the energy-efﬁciency maximization problem as follow,

Note that the numerator in (2) is non-concave and the numerator and the denominator in (2) and the constraint in (8) are non-convex. We approximate the non-concave part to concave using high-SNR approximation, and also the nonconvex part to a convex problem using a slack variable, and the ﬁrst Taylor approximation as in [1]. Considering the upper bound of (1) and the rate model for FSOC, the energyefﬁciency problem (2) is reformulated as

For solving (9), we use the sequential fractional algorithm by iterating (9) with updated qj[n] and vj[n].
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In Figs. 1 and 2, we assumed the altitude H = 100m, c1 = 9.26 × 10−4, c2 = 2250, bandwidth B = 1MHz, initial position qI = [0, 1000]T , end position qF = [1000, 0]T , initial/end velocity vI = vF = 30 (qF − qI) /�qF − q0�, ﬂighttime T = 400. Figs. 1 presents the comparison of the proposed

energy efﬁcient ﬂight paths without and with geometric loss based on beam divergence effect with DR = 8cm, DT = 3cm, and θdiv = 2mrad. For Fig. 2, each of the four ﬂight paths represents an energy efﬁcient trajectory when the different atmospheric environments are taken into account. We assumed the parameter values in wet snow a = 5.42λ × 10−5 + 5.50, b = 1.38 [3]. Fig. 1 shows that as the beam divergence effect increases, the channel condition deteriorates and thus the radius of the trajectory becomes narrower. Similarly, Fig. 2 shows that depending on the weather condition, the communication environment changes and the range of energy efﬁcient trajectory changes.
