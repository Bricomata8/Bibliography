Abstract—Simple and reliable spectrum sensing schemes are important for cognitive radio (CR) to avoid interference to the primary users (PUs). At present, most of the existing sensing schemes are proposed in Gaussian noise. Nevertheless, in practice, CR suffers from non-Gaussian noise such as man-made impulsive noise, ultra-wideband interference and co-channel interference. In this article, to handle the detection performance degradation in non-Gaussian impulsive noise environments, a robust spectrum sensing scheme namely hyperbolic tangent based energy detector (HT-ED) is proposed. The proposed HT-ED is a semi-blind method which does not require any a priori knowledge about the primary user’s signals. Furthermore, the HT-ED can provide a superior detection performance compared with the conventional energy detector (ED) in a wide range of non-Gaussian noises. The simulation results show that the proposed HT-ED is very robust against impulsive noises which are modeled as the Laplace or α-stable noises. Moreover the detection performance of HT-ED is much better than those of the traditional ED and FLOM-based methods.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid development of wireless communication, the
shortage of the traditional ﬁxed spectrum allocation policies
is more and more serious. These ﬁxed rules lead to a severe
problem that some radio bands are terribly busy while other
bands are underused. As a result, the utilization of spectrum is
low and unbalanced. Cognitive radio (CR) is seen as a promis-
ing technology to deal with this contradiction between the
growing spetrum congestion and the low utilization of radio
bands[1,2]. In CR, secondary users (SUs) have an opportunity
to access the spectrum bands licensed to primary users (PUs)
when the licensed bands are idle. Therefore spectrum sensing
is a crucial technology in CR, which guarantees the PUs are
not interfered by the SUs.
There are many researchers who have proposed a lot of
spectrum sensing algorithms[3-6] to perform the signal de-
tection, recently. Among them, energy detector (ED) based
methods are wildly used, because they are simple and easy
to implement. Furthermore, energy detector is a semi-blind
process which obtains the sensing threshold only dependent

on noise, and it compares the detection statistics with the threshold to determine the sensing result.
Unfortunately, these energy based sensing methods are only valid in Gaussian noise environments[7-9] while in the case of non-Gaussian noise, the performances of these methods degrade drastically due to the impulsive noise[10]. As is known to all, Gaussian noise is an idealized model for thermal noise which has no heavy tails. However in practice, almost all kinds of noises produced in various indoor and outdoor environments are not Gaussian noises but non-Gaussian noises which have heavy tails. In indoor environments, the communication signals are disturbed by the man-made impulsive noises which may be produced by electromechanical switches. On the other hand, in outdoor environments, a lot of phenomena such as power lines, lightning in the sky and buildings in radar clutter, are the sources of impulsive noises[11].
Spectrum sensing for non-Gaussian noise has been proposed by some scholars, recently[7,8,12]. [7] presents an accurate kernelized energy detection in impulsive noise. A suprathreshold stochastic resonance based spectrum sensing in nonGaussian noise is proposed in [8]. A fractional lower order moments (FLOMs) based scheme is put forward in [12]. However, there are still some issues for spectrum sensing in non-Gaussian noise environments. First of all, the detection performance under non-Gaussian noise is not good enough. Next, due to the requirement of realtime detection, the computational complexity has to be low. Last, as some SUs may exist under Gaussian noise and others are under non-Gaussian noise, the new algorithm must be able to handle both Gaussian and nonGaussian noise simultaneously.
To solve the above-mentioned performance degradation problems in non-Gaussian noise environments, we propose a hyperbolic tangent based energy detector (HT-ED) which is motivated by the simplicity of the conventional ED. Hyperbolic tangent function, whose graph is a S-shaped curve, appears in many neural networks as a transfer function[13-15]. This curve is used widely due to the fact that it is the simplest nonlinear curve that can strike a graceful balance between linear and non-linear behavior. In this paper, hyperbolic tangent

function is applied to suppress the impulsive noise by the non-linear behavior, while it does not restrain the normal noise because of the linear behavior. As will be interpreted in Section III, the hyperbolic tangent is considered as a wonderful choice for modifying the conventional energy detector due to its sensing accuracy and low computational complexity in the presence of non-Gaussian noise environments. Furthermore, the HT-ED is quite robust against impulsive noises, because of the fact that the impulsive part of noises is suppressed. Simulation results show that the HT-ED has a superior sensing capability compared to the conventional ED, and the conventional ED fails in α-stable noise scenario when α < 2. Besides, when the noise is Laplace noise, the performance of HT-ED is also better than that of the conventional ED.
The paper is organized as follows. Signal model and traditional energy detection are brieﬂy depicted in Section II. The elaborate description of the proposed HT-ED is displayed in Section III. In Section IV, the performances of the proposed scheme are evaluated numerically. Conclusions are provided in Section V.

II. SIGNAL MODEL AND TRADITIONAL ENERGY DETECTOR

A. Signal model
This paper considers a single cognitive user spectrum sensing scenario. The cognitive user detects the transmitting state of PU by the received signals X = [x (1) , x (2) , · · · , x (N )], where N is the number of samples and x (n) is the sample signal at discrete time n. Then the signal received by the cognitive user is described as

H0 : x (n) = v (n) H1 : x (n) = s (n) + v (n) , (n = 1, 2, · · · , N )

(1)

where n = 1, 2, · · · , N is the sample index. s (n) represents the signal transmitted by PU, and it can be assumed as a Gaussian signal with mean 0 and variance σs2. v (n) is the additive noise with mean 0 and variance σv2. Without loss of generality, we assume that the noise v (n) and the PU’s signal s (n) are independent. More over, the received signal samples s (n) are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In this paper, the additive noise is modeled as Gaussian or non-Gaussian distributions. Particularly, Laplace and αstable noise are applied to model the practical man-made impulsive noise. H0 and H1 denote the absence and presence of the PU, respectively.

B. Traditional energy detector

The purpose of the energy detector is to test whether the PU signal is present (Hypothesis H1) or not (Hypothesis H0). If the decision is H0, the SU can obtain the opportunity to use the spectrum for transmitting information. The energy detector statistic is calculated as

M

Ted (X) =

x(m)2

(2)

m=1

where X = [x(1), x(2), ..., x(M )]T is the sampled signal data set. A threshold γ is needed to make the decision between present and absent. Then we have the detection scheme

H0 : Ted (X) < γ H1 : Ted (X) > γ

(3)

If the statistic is smaller than the threshold γ, the decision is H0. If not, the present of PU (H1) is considered. When the noise v (n) is Gaussian noise, the statistic distribution of the received signal x(n) is a norm distribution in both hypotheses

H0 : X ∼ N 0, σv2 H1 : X ∼ N 0, σv2 + σs2

(4)

So the decision statistic Ted (X) in the case of H0, will follow a central chi-square distribution with a degree of freedom M . However, in the case of H1, Ted (X) obeys a non-central chisquare distribution with the same degree of freedom and a non centrality parameter 2ζ, (ζ = σs2 σv2).
According to the central limit theorem[16], in order to
make a reliable test result, the sample number should be large enough, and then Ted (X) approximately follows Gaussian distribution

H0 : Ted (X) ∼ N M σv2, 2M σv4 H1 : Ted (X) ∼ N M σs2 + σv2 , 2M σs2 + σv2 2
(5)

Therefore, the detection and false alarm probabilities can be expressed as

Pd = Q

γ−M √

σs2 + σv2

2M (σs2 + σv2)

(6)

and

Pf = Q

γ√− M σv2 2M σv2

respectively,

where

Q (x)

which is the tail probability of the standard normal distribution.

The threshold γ can be calculated by a predeﬁned false alarm

probability

√

γ = Q−1 (Pf ) 2M σv2 + M σv2

(8)

Then the detection probability can be expressed as

√

Pd = Q

Q−1 (√Pf ) 2M σv2 − M σs2 2M (σs2 + σv2)

III. HYPERBOLIC TANGENT BASED ENERGY DETECTOR

In this section, we, ﬁrstly, describe three noise models: Gaussian noise, Laplace noise and α-stable noise. Gaussian noise is the idealized noise model for most of the signal processing, regardless of actual situations. However, Laplace noise and α-stable noise are non-Gaussian modeled for real situations. Next, we derive the hyperbolic tangent based energy detector elaborately.

A. Noise model

1) Gaussian noise: Gaussian distribution can be expressed

as

fg

=

e−

(x−ug
2σ2

)2

2πσ

(10)

where ug is the mean value and σ is the standard deviation. The normal distribution is the bell-shaped curve with no heavy tails and widely applied in signal processing to model the ideal noise.
2) Laplace noise: Laplace distribution is a typical model used for the non-Gaussian noise in wireless communications, because of its heavy-tail behavior, and the probability density function can be shown by the following

fl (x)

=

1 e−

|x−ul
λ

|

2λ

(11)

where ul is the location parameter, λ > 0 is the scale parameter, the higher the value λ is, the heavier the tail is when the location parameter ul is ﬁxed. Therefore, Laplace is appropriate for modeling the non-Gaussian noise in practical wireless communications.
3) α-stable noise: As the α-stable distribution has no closed form expression for the probability density function, its characteristic function is used to describe α-stable distribution:

ϕ (x) = exp {jµx − r|x|α [1 + jβsign (x) w (x, α)]} (12)

where

w (x, α) =

(13)

where −∞ < µ < +∞ is the location parameter; r > 0 is the dispersion parameter, which relates to the distributions spread around the center; −1 < β < 1 is the symmetry parameter, when β = 0, the distribution is symmetric about µ, and it is called a symmetry α-stable distribution (SαS); 0 < α ≤ 2 is the characteristic exponent parameter, which determines the heaviness of the tail, it has more impulsive noise under a smaller α. In this paper, we assume β = 0 and µ = 0, then the characteristic function is

ϕ (x) = e−r|x|α

(14)

B. Hyperbolic tangent based energy detector

In this subsection, we ﬁrst take a brief look at the funda-

mental concepts of hyperbolic tangent and then propose a new

robust spectrum sensing scheme, called hyperbolic tangent

based energy detector (HT-ED).

1) Hyperbolic tangent: Hyperbolic tangent has been ap-

plied considerable popularity in neural network as a nonlinear

transfer function for neurons in the last decades because of its

robustness and simplicity. The hyperbolic tangent is expressed

as

2

y (n) = tanh (ax (n)) = 1 − e2ax(n) + 1

(15)

where a is the shape parameter which is related to the slope of the function, and a > 0. Fig. 1 is the hyperbolic tangent curves

with different shape parameters. From Fig. 1, we ﬁnd that the
larger the shape parameter, the steeper slope at the origin of coordinates (0, 0). We can also see that the range of the hyperbolic tangent is (−1, 1), that is y = tanh (ax (n)) = 1,
x→+∞
and y = tanh (ax (n)) = −1.
x→−∞

2) Hyperbolic tangent based energy detector (HT-ED):

Conventional energy detector is a simple algorithm for spec-

trum sensing, and it is easy to implement in CR systems.

But it has no ability to copy with the impulsive noise, as a

consequence, the performance of ED degrade drastically in

non-Gaussian noise. According to the previous description,

hyperbolic tangent can deal with the impulsive noise by

its non-linear behavior. Motivated by the simplicity of the

conventional energy detector and the non-linear property of

the hyperbolic tangent, the hyperbolic tangent based energy

detector (HT-ED) is proposed which is simple and easy to

implement. The test statistic of ED is deﬁned as Ted =

1 M

M

x (m)2, where x (m) is the received signal sample.

m=1

Thus, we can make a hyperbolic tangent map of the samples

and then the test statistic of the HT-ED is showed as follows:

1 Tht−ed = M

M

tanh2 (ax (m))

(16)

m=1

As the Taylor expansion of tanh (x) is expressed as

We can see the higher order moments as well as the second moment are employed in HT-ED. The HT-ED which can be seen as an improved non-linear version of the ED takes use of the second moment and the higher order moments of the signal. Higher order moment has a great potential to copy with non-Gaussian noises[17].
According to the central limit theorem[16], if the sample number M is large enough, Tht−ed approximately follows Gaussian distribution

H0 : Tht−ed ∼ N (m0, v0) H1 : Tht−ed ∼ N (m1, v1)

respectively, where E {·} represents the expectation of a

due to the space considerations. In this article, we replace the theoretical mean value mk and the theoretical variance vk2 with the statistical mean value m˜ k and the statistical variance v˜k2, respectively, as follows:

Pf = Q

γ − m˜ 0 v˜0

(24)

and

Pd = Q

γ − m˜ 1 v˜1

(25)

respectively. In order to ﬁnd the sensing threshold γ, we assume Pf is preset in the range of [0.01, 0.1]. So, the sensing threshold is expressed as

γ = Q−1 (Pf ) v˜0 + m˜ 0

(26)

Next, we introduce the proposed HT-ED based spectrum sensing algorithm from the practical perspective. The two stage sensing supported by the IEEE 802.22[18] is applied in the practical procedure in which ﬁne sensing stage is designed for extracting pure noise samples, and these samples are used in the following fast sensing stage. More detailed descriptions of the stages are that the statistical mean m˜ 0 and the statistical variance v˜02 of the noise are calculated for obtaining the sensing threshold γ in the ﬁne sensing stage, then in the fast sensing stage, the sensing threshold is used to detect the hypotheses. During the ﬁne sensing stage, longer time spans are considered for accurate detection, while the fast sensing stage is much faster to meet the practical requirements in cognitive radio system. So the robust sensing algorithm based on HT-ED is summarized in Algorithm 1.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, the performance of the proposed HT-ED algorithm is simulated in practical impulsive man-made noises to conﬁrm its accuracy and robustness. To verify the performance, the simulation considers a one-primary and onesecondary users scenario where SU performs the spectrum sensing test by HT-ED algorithm. The cardinality of the samples set in sensing task is chosen as M = 200. The shape parameter of the hyperbolic tangent is assumed to be ﬁxed, a = 0.5. In addition, the preset noise distributions for generating noise samples are Gaussian, Laplace or αstable. Moreover, the monte carlo method is applied in the simulations, and the number of iteration in each simulation is 1000. The conventional ED which has been widely discussed in previous literatures[4,5] is compared with the proposed HT-ED scheme. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

curves and the detection probability in different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are used to depict the detection performance of both algorithms in various noise scenarios.
Firstly, we investigate the performance of the proposed HT-ED and the conventional ED in Laplace noise (LN) and Gaussian noise (GN) scenarios. Fig.2 shows the ROC curves of both schemes with SNR=-10dB. As represented in Fig.2, the performances of both schemes are almost the same in GN as expected. However, in the case of LN, the proposed HTED has a better performance than the conventional ED. This is because of the fact that the HT-ED has the ability to restrain the impulse noise and scale the normal signal linearly as well. Fig.3 shows the detection probability of both schemes against different SNRs with the false alarm probability Pf = 0.01. As depicted in Fig.3, compared with the conventional ED, the new HT-ED has a better detection performance in LN.

noise cannot be expressed, the generalized signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) deﬁned as GSN R = σs2 r is used to replace SNR, where σs2 is the power of signal, and r is the dispersion parameter of α-stable noise. Fig.4 shows the ROC curves for the proposed and the ED schemes with different α-stable noises α = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, β = 0 and GSN R = −10dB. It is worthwhile to note that if α = 1 and β = 0, the αstable distribution is Cauchy distribution, while if α = 2, the distribution is Gaussian distribution. Fig.5 demonstrates the detection probability for both algorithms with different GSNRs in α-stable distribution. Fig.4 and Fig.5 show that the HT-ED performs much better than the ED when α < 2. Moreover, it also can be found in the simulation results the proposed algorithm is very robust against various impulsive noises. On the contrast, the conventional ED dose not have the ability to sense the spectrum in these impulsive noises. These are due to the fact that the hyperbolic tangent f (x) = tanh (ax), is bounded among -1 and 1 regardless of the noise density.

Next, we simulate the performance of the HT-ED and the comparison among the new method and the ED scheme in various α-stable impulsive noises. As the SNR in α-stable

The performance of the new HT-ED scheme is compared

to that of the FLOM-based algorithm[12]. The test statistic

of FLOM-based algorithm which is similar to energy detector

is expressed as TF LOM =

where

the

power

p

ranges in interval from 0 to 2, i.e., (0, 2]. As the performance

of the FLOM-based scheme for impulsive noise is acceptable,

we adopt FLOMs to show the superiority of the HT-ED

scheme. Fig. 6 is the ROC curves comparison of HT-ED for

different shape parameters a = 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and FLOM-based

scheme with different powers p = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 for the α-

stable noise distributions with α = 1. In addition, the GSNR

and the cardinality of the received samples set are set as

GSN R = −5dB and M = 400, respectively. As illustrated

in Fig. 6, performance of HT-ED is more outstanding than

that of FLOM-based scheme. As seen in the picture, when

the shape parameter a ranges from 0.25 to 1, as greater the a

in HT-ED, the performance of the HT-ED becomes better. It

is worth mentioning that a most appropriate shape parameter corresponds to the best performance. This is because that the most appropriate shape parameter means the impulsive noise is just suppressed to 1 or -1, and the normal signal is mapped linearly.

V. CONCLUSION
In this work, a robust spectrum sensing algorithm, called the hyperbolic tangent based energy detector, is proposed for nonGaussian impulsive man-made noise. The hyperbolic tangent has the ability to suppress the impulsive noise, on the other hand it does not suppress the normal signal. Consequently the proposed HT-ED has the ability to ignore the inﬂuence of impulsive noise and then obtains a robust performance. So it performs pretty well for the case of α-stable noise when α < 2, while the conventional ED can not deal with the impulsive noise and it leads to a poor performance.
