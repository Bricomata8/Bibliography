Abstract—In ﬁfth generation and beyond (B5G) technologies, delay constrains emerge as a topic of particular interest for ultra reliable low latency communications (e.g., enhanced reality, haptic communications). In this short paper, we study the performance of a two-user uplink NOMA network under quality of service (QoS) delay constraints, captured through each user’s effective capacity (EC). We propose novel closed-form expressions for the EC of the NOMA users, validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Interestingly, our study shows that in the high signal to noise ratio (SNR) region, the “strong” NOMA user is more penalized in terms of its EC under the same delay constraint as the “weak” user.

I. INTRODUCTION
Non orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes have attracted a lot of attention recently, allowing multiple users to be served simultaneously with enhanced spectral efﬁciency; it is known that the boundary of achievable rate pairs (in the case of two users) using NOMA is outside the capacity region achievable with orthogonal multiple access techniques [1]. Superior achievable rates are attainable though the use of superposition coding at the transmitter and of successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver [2], [3]. The SIC receiver decodes multi-user signals with descending received signal power and subtracts the decoded signal(s) from the received multi-user signal, so as to improve the signal-tointerference ratio. The process is repeated until the signal of interest is decoded. In uplink NOMA networks, the strongest user’s signal is decoded ﬁrst (as opposed to downlink NOMA networks in which the inverse order is applied).
Besides, in a number of emerging applications, quality of service (QoS) delay constraints become increasingly important, e.g., ultra reliable low latency (URLLC) systems. Furthermore, in future wireless networks, users are expected to necessitate ﬂexible delay guarantees for achieving different service requirements. Henceforth, in order to satisfy diverse delay requirements, a simple and ﬂexible delay QoS model is imperative to be applied and investigated. In this respect, the effective capacity (EC) theory can be employed [4], [5] [6], with EC denoting the maximum constant arrival rate which can be served by a given service process, while guaranteeing the required statistical delay provisioning.

In this work, we provide a performance evaluation of the uplink of a two-user NOMA network under delay constraints, captured through the users’ effective capacities (ECs). We note that the EC is a QoS aware data link layer metric [5], that captures the achievable rate under a delay violation probability threshold. To clarify further, let Rm represent the achievable rate of the m-th user, θm its statistical delay QoS exponent, and assume that the service process satisﬁes Ga¨rtner-Ellis theorem [5]. The notion of the delay exponent θm captures how strict the delay constraint is [5]. A slower decay rate can be represented by a smaller θm, which indicates that the system is more delay tolerant, while a larger θm corresponds to systems with more stringent QoS requirement.
Applying the EC theory in a NOMA setting with multiple users, the m-th user’s EC over a block-fading channel, is deﬁned as:

Ecm

e−θm Tf B Rm

(in b/s/Hz) , (1)

where Tf is the symbol period, B the block bandwidth and E [·] denotes expectation over the channel gains.
This short paper is organized as follows: In Section II we investigate the EC of a two user uplink NOMA system under the delay QoS constraints. Simulation results are given in Section III, followed by conclusions in Section IV.

II. EFFECTIVE CAPACITY OF TWO USER NOMA UPLINK
Assume a two user NOMA uplink with users U1 and U2, in a Rayleigh block fading channel with respective gains |h1|2 < |h2|2, transmitting symbols S1, S2 respectively, with power E[|S1|2] = P1 and E[|S2|2] = P2. The superimposed signal received at the base station (BS) can be expressed as:

Z = P1h1S1 + P2h2S2 + w,

(2)

where w denotes a zero mean circularly symmetric Gaussian random variable with variance σ2. The BS will ﬁrst decode the

symbol of the strongest user U2 treating the transmission of

U1 as interference. After decoding S2, it suppresses it from Z

and will decode S1. Following the SIC principle, and denoting

by

ρ=

the transmit

SNR, the achievable rates, in

b/s/Hz,

for both users U1 and U2 are expressed as [7]:

R1 = log2[1 + ρP1|h1|2],

ability density function (pdf) f (γi). Ranking these random

variables using order statistics we obtain:

fγ1:2 (γ1) = ψ1f (γ1)F (γ1),

fγ2:2 (γ2) = ψ2f (γ2)(1 − F (γ2)),

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In the following, we validate using Monte Carlo simulations [10] the accuracy of the mathematical expressions for the effective capacity of both users Ec1 and Ec2. We plot the ECs over the following parameters (βi,ρ,Pi), i = {1, 2}.

A. Effective Capacities vs the Normalized Delay Exponents
Fig. 1 shows the curves of the Ec1 and Ec2 in a scenario where the power of the user with stronger channel condition U2 is P2 = 1 Watt and that of the weaker user U1 is P1 = 0.8 Watt. The plots conﬁrm the validity of the proposed expressions in (14) and (15). Note than in the case of Ec2 only integer values of β are examined in order to reduce the computation time. The numerical results in Fig.1 show that as the normalized delay exponent βi, i = {1, 2} decreases (i.e., the application has stricter delay-constraints), the value of the EC for both users decreases, i.e., the achievable data link layer rates while guaranteeing a certain level of delay QoS constraint decrease. This result is in agreement with the respective trend in OMA networks [11].

B. Effective Capacities vs the Transmit SNR
Here we consider the scenario in which both users have the same QoS delay requirements (they are both users of the same “class”), i.e., the normalized delay exponents are the same, e.g., β1 = β2 = −1. Besides, the two users U1 and U2 transmit their signals with power P1 = 0.8 Watt and P2 = 1 Watt, respectively, as in the previous scenario.
As shown in Fig. 2, the Monte Carlo numerical results agree with the evaluation of Ec1 and Ec2 obtained from the analysis presented in Section II, further validating the proposed expressions. Quite interestingly, at very high transmit SNR values (ρ ≥ 45 dB), we see that Ec1 surpasses Ec2.
Unlike the results presented in Subsection III.A, this effect is counter-intuitive. Our analysis demonstrates that for users of the same “class” (i.e., with the same delay exponents), the strong NOMA user can be more penalized in terms of its EC than the weak user. The reason for this is that the signal emitted from the weak user acts as interference for the strong NOMA user in an uplink network. As a result, the weak user’s EC is not constrained by interference, while the strong user’s is, and this effect is more evident in the high SNR region.
C. Effective Capacities vs Power Levels
Finally, in this third set of results, we evaluated Ec1 and Ec2 for various values of P1 ∈ [10−2, 1] Watts while we ﬁxed P2 = 1 Watt and β1 = β2 = −1; The curves in Fig. 3 showcase the agreement between the Monte Carlo simulation of Ec1 and Ec2 and the expressions in (14) and (15). Furthermore, when the transmitted powers are equal (P1 = P2 =1W), the EC of the strong user is only slightly higher than the EC of the weak one. This trend is however not universal and depends on the delay exponents as well, which here were taken equal (both users belong to the same QoS class).
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The concept of the effective capacity enables us to study the achievable data link layer rates when QoS delay guarantees are in place in the form of delay exponents. In this paper, we have investigated the effective capacity of the uplink of a two-user NOMA network, assuming a block Rayleigh fading channel. We have derived novel closed-form expressions for the effective capacity of the weak user and proposed novel

expressions for the strong user. We validated the proposed
mathematical formulas with Monte Carlo simulations and were
able to study the impact of the delay exponent, the transmit
SNR and the transmit power in the ECs of the two users. Intuitively, the ECs of both users decrease as the delay
constraints become stringer. On the other hand, in the high
transmit SNR regime, the EC of the weak user can surpass
the EC of the strong user, as the latter is interference limited.
Finally, the EC of the weak user increases with increasing
its transmit power, while the EC of the strong user decreases
when the weak user increases its transmit power. In the future
we will generalize this analysis to NOMA uplink networks
with multiple superimposed users.
