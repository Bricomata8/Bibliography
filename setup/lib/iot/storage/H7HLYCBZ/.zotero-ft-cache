This Week
• HW1 is due this Thursday (September 24) at 11:59 pm (Eastern Time)
• Remember to attend section. If you need to change sections, try to swap with someone (there is a Piazza thread for this).
• Make sure you have read the homework policies on the syllabus, and follow the homework submission procedure carefully. See https:// piazza.com/class/icf0cypdc3243c?cid=451
• Always check your submission. • Late days are calculated based on the time
stamp of the last push to your respository.

Two Fundamental Questions
1.What is the goal?
• predict future data? • explain and understand a phenomenon? • test a hypothesis? • compare two groups? • dimension reduction? • build a good recommendation system? • decide on a course of action or a policy?

Two Fundamental Questions
2.Who cares?

IMAC
I: inferential goal (scientiﬁc question of interest) M: model (all models are wrong, some are useful) A: algorithms C: conclusions and checking
The C is crucial: what did we learn? Was the model useful, and how well does it ﬁt? How do we know whether the method is working? Do we need to iterate and improve the model? What are the limitations and future directions?

Some Key Principles
• remember The Golden Rule • know your audience • tell a story • choose and use notation carefully • read great writers • create good sense of direction (with the
help of signposts), with clear ﬂow of logic

Notation, notation, notation

The Science of Scientiﬁc Writing (Gopen-Swan)

The smallest of the URF’s (URFA6L), a 207-nucleotide (nt) reading frame overlapping out of phase the NH2-terminal portion of the adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) subunit 6 gene has been identiﬁed as the animal equivalent of the recently discovered yeast H+-ATPase subunit 8 gene. The functional signiﬁcance of the other URF’s has been, on the contrary, elusive. Recently, however, immunoprecipitation experiments with antibodies to puriﬁed, rotenone-sensitive NADH-ubiquinone oxido-reductase [hereafter referred to as respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase or complex I] from bovine heart, as well as enzyme fractionation studies, have indicated that six human URF’s (that is, URF1, URF2, URF3, URF4, URF4L, and URF5, hereafter referred to as ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, and ND5) encode subunits of complex I. This is a large complex that also contains many subunits synthesized in the cytoplasm.

But what about structure, not just jargon?
The smallest of the URF’s, an [A] has been identiﬁed as a [B] subunit 8 gene. The functional signiﬁcance of the other URF’s has been, on the contrary, elusive. Recently, however, [C] experiments, as well as [D] studies, have indicated that six human URF’s [1-6] encode subunits of Complex I. This is a large complex that also contains many subunits synthesized in the cytoplasm.
How are these sentences connected? What is the emphasis?

Linda the Bank Teller (Kahneman-Tversky)
Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.
Which is more probable? 1. Linda is a bank teller. 2. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
85% of Stanford Business School students participating in the study said option 2 is more probable.

Abstract: This paper describes several problems, all arising from one real-world problem. Some of these problems have been solved, others offer interesting challenges.

Tell a Story!
Any story has a beginning, a middle, and an end.
• introduce interesting characters • put them in a predicament • resolve the predicament • but leave room for sequels! (Limitations
and future work)

Tell a Story   with Data

Stories
Stories are the most powerful delivery tool for information, more powerful and enduring than any other art form

New York Times

Key Considerations
• Who is your audience? • What questions are you answering? • Why should the audience care? • What are your major insights and surprises? • What change to you want to affect?

Know Your Audience
People you don’t know are difﬁcult to inﬂuence People you don’t know are difﬁcult to inﬂuence

Know Your Audience
• What do they know? • What motivates them? What do they desire? • What experiences do you share? What are
common goals?
• What insights can you give them? What tools and “magical gifts”?

Don’t Make Them Think!
• Your audience does not want to spend cognitive effort on things you know and can just show them
• Lead them through the major steps of your story • Point out interesting key facts and insights using
captions and annotations

Unexpectedness
Make the audience aware that there is something they didn’t know they didn’t know
Use surprise to grab the audience’s attention “You might think you know this, but here’s a new angle on it” Curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge

Messaging

Framing - Why should I care?
• Tell the audience: “Here is the right way to think about the problem I was trying to solve.”
• Catch the audience’s attention and frame the story using captions and annotations
• If done well, your insights will seem obvious given this framing. And that’s a good thing!
