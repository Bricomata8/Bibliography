Abstract—Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is envisioned as promising 5G multiple access technology due to its throughput gain achieved through grouping mobile nodes having substantial difference in channel conditions and capability to serve large number of users simultaneously at same time, frequency, or code, but with different power levels. Furthermore, modiﬁcations in OFDM waveform for relaxed synchronization and supporting short burst communications for Internet of Things (IoT) devices has paved the way for Universal Filtered MultiCarrier (UFMC) waveform. However, a major disadvantage in deployment of Non-Orthogonal UFMC is the high Peakto-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) being comparable to that of OFDMA. As such, additional PAPR reduction techniques are required for reducing the dynamic range of power ampliﬁer deployed in communication system. We take up Power Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) in which available power is sliced between users and investigate the performance of SC-FDMA for PDNOMA UFMC systems for PAPR reduction. UFMC is known to provide additional diversity to transmitter in uplink and facilitates relaxed synchronization at the receiver side in downlink scenario. Simulation results show that in ﬂat-fading scenario, BER performance of proposed system is found to be signiﬁcantly better than OFDM and UFMC. However, BER performance of proposed system in AWGN channel is seen to be traded off as the extent of SC-FDMA precoding increases. Also, increasing pilots per subband leads to increased PAPR with OFDM, UFMC whereas SC-FDMA for PD-NOMA UFMC system shows stagnation and signiﬁcant comparative reduction in PAPR values.

I. INTRODUCTION
5G technology is visualizing a rapid evolution in the design of air interface protocols and standards to serve its multi-faceted requirements. As such, 5G is expected to roll out by early 2020 and the frequency allocations for the same will probably be decided in World Radiocommunication Congress (WRC) meeting due in 2019 [1]. Several Non-Orthogonal techniques have been proposed for upcoming 5G radio access to achieve the vision of 5G. Among these, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has been a dominant solution to boost fairness and throughput simultaneously providing reliable spectrum access. In OFDMA, spectrum is segmented optimally for different users on the basis of their channel conditions implying that the users closer to Base Station (BS) are allocated more subcarriers and hence enjoy higher throughput while the

cell-edge users are allocated lesser subcarriers since they might fail to even access the channel owing to bad channel conditions (e.g. fading, path loss, shadowing). But, in Power-domain NOMA (PD-NOMA), users with lower SINR (LSU) to BS are favored for fairness in spectrum access compared to higher SINR Users (HSU) as 1) they are allocated higher transmit power by BS, and 2) receiver demodulation complexity is lower for LSU. PD-NOMA employs Superposition Coding (SC) and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the transmitter and receiver respectively [2]. Apart from fairness, the network experiences lower latency since multiple users are being served at the same time. UFMC is a candidate for 5G technology for providing adaptive and reliable spectrum access to users. We have considered UFMC above other 5G waveforms such as Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM), Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC), and Filtered OFDM (F-OFDM) because in UFMC, each user can adaptively transmit its data using variable subband size, ﬁlter length, and DFT resolution [3]. In addition, ﬁltering reduces out-of-band emission and also provides soft error protection from varying channel conditions since unlike OFDM, UFMC does not utilize Cyclic Preﬁx (CP), preventing bandwidth wastage [4]. But UFMC possesses high Peak-to-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) (comparable to that of OFDMA) which is detrimental to cost-effectiveness and performance of linear ampliﬁers. Moreover, PAPR reduction is necessary to mitigate interference to LU for underlay CR operation. Variants of Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) has been utilized for OFDMA for PAPR reduction [5]. NOMA and UFMC both hike the system performance by packing more signals than mandated by orthogonality conditions in power and frequency domain respectively thereby deliberately introducing Inter Symbol Interference (ISI). At the receiver end, interference resolution for NOMA is taken care of by SIC procedure. For UFMC, ﬁlter-based equalization and ﬁlter length parameters are used for interference mitigation. In [6] and [7], NOMA technique combined with SC-FDMA for uplink scenario is evaluated. SC-FDMA is used for high power efﬁciency requirements such as uplink and downlink micro/pico BSs. This paper conceptualizes the the combination of the NOMA and UFMC techniques for effectively utilizing both power and frequency domain resources while reducing the PAPR using SC-FDMA. In this paper, we analyze the impact of various SC-FDMA conﬁgurations and pilot addition

II. MODEL DESIGN

PD-NOMA supports both downlink and uplink scenarios

where in the downlink, SIC is performed at individual nodes.

In the uplink, BS performs SIC for separating users’ data from

multiplexed signal. However, as noted in [8], if the number

of users are increased signiﬁcantly, the effective performance

gain of PD-NOMA over OFDMA saturates while receiver

complexity grows in performing SIC. Additionally, if data of

even a single user is corrupted, it leads to error-propagation

affecting multiple users [9]. A straightforward approach is

therefore, to select users with substantial difference in their

SINR and pair them for PD-NOMA. In [10], DFT-Spread

OFDM with guard interval has been proposed as 5G waveform

with only marginal BER leverage compared to OFDM. In our

work, however, we have considered SC-FDMA for UFMC with

PD-NOMA yielding lower PAPR and signiﬁcantly improved

BER performance. Also, PD-NOMA with UFMC is chosen

speciﬁcally for relaxing synchronization requirement rather

than PD-NOMA with SC-FDMA [6].

Consider typical downlink scenario in which one BS and J

mobile nodes are present (refer Fig. 1) [11]. As discussed earlier, we put J =2. BS sends bits bl, bh ∈ {0, 1}2M·P for LSU, HSU after which P coded bits {cpl,k}Pp=1, {cph,k}Pp=1 are mapped to modulation symbol dl[k], dh[k] ∈ D respectively where D is a 2M-ary QAM constellation set.

and d = dl ⊕ dh where ⊕ refers to Multi User Superposition

Transmission Category 1 type technique [12], [13]. Figure 4

illustrates the SC signal constellation identical to that of 16-

QAM formed with the superposition of two 4-QAM signals.

Generation of pilots is done using Zadoff-Chu sequence

dpil[a] = e−jπa2/Psub , a = 0, 1, · · · , Psub − 1

(1)

which are then slotted in the SC signal at regular intervals on per subband basis. Here, Psub is the total number of pilots. Zadoff-Chu sequences are commonly used for synchronization due to the fact that these sequences exhibit zero autocorrelation when cyclically shifted. Figure 3 shows pilots and UFMC subcarriers stacked together for LSU, HSU and SC signals. Note that Zadoff-Chu sequence is a subset of Constant Amplitude Zero Autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences (cf. Fig. 4). P complex symbols and Psub pilots are divided into B subbands each comprising of Q subcarriers and C pilots, i.e. M = (P + Psub)/B = Q + C. Afterwards, each subband data vector d = {d[0], . . . , d[M − 1]}T is precoded using SC-FDMA and spread over N points. At this stage, various Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) schemes for spreading may be applied on the (M < N ) symbols. We have employed Distributed FDMA (DFDMA) (DFT data points are placed at regular intervals) and Interleaved FDMA (IFDMA) (interval between DFT data points is such that N/M is an integer) while Localized FDMA (LFDMA) (DFT data points are placed sequentially) is simply inherited when we use only UFMC for transmission [14], [15]. Consider signal D which is obtained after DFT operation as

For constructing a signal with oversampling factor R = N/M , upsampling by R and an anti-imaging ﬁlter is required. Upsampling operation by R and IFFT operation converts the input signal D[n] to du[n] = d[n/R] given by

III. RESULTS
A. Impact of SC-FDMA and pilots
As mentioned in [8], the performance gain of NOMA over OFDMA is minimal at lower SNR values. Since PAPR varies with block length, we have ﬁxed NF F T = 1024 and modulation scheme as 4-QAM (cf. Table I). BER performance graphs in AWGN scenario indicate that PAPR for PD-NOMA OFDM, UFMC schemes increases with increasing pilots per subband (refer Fig. 5, 7, 9). PAPR values for PD-NOMA IFDMA/DFDMA shows PAPR improvement of max. ∼13.5/10 and min. ∼8/2.5 dB considering all conﬁgurations (cf. Table II). However, BER performance of PD-NOMA IFDMA/DFDMA is worse by nearly 7/5 dB at BER=10−3 compared to PD-NOMA OFDM/UFMC schemes (cf. Fig. 6, 8, 10). The choice between using IFDMA and DFDMA also depends on required diversity gain and amount of CFO interference [17].

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND SCOPE FOR FURTHER RESEARCH
We have considered PD-NOMA model with two user groups demarcated as LSU and HSU. In this paper, we have evaluated PD-NOMA UFMC system with SC-FDMA and pilots under AWGN and rayleigh channels. The overhead due to SIC procedure is found to lie in range of 0-5 dB. Results show signiﬁcant

reduction in PAPR while employing SC-FDMA precoding. In Rayleigh ﬂat fading, the proposed scheme performs far better than OFDM/UFMC based PD-NOMA. However, BER performance takes toll when DFDMA is employed and more so on applying IFDMA. The BER performance of PD-NOMA DFDMA/IFDMA at 10−3 is nearly 7/5 dB worse than PDNOMA OFDM while PAPR is better by atleast 8/2.5 dB considering all conﬁgurations in AWGN conditions. The BER performance gap for considered SC-FDMA techniques can be minimized using pilot-aided estimation techniques for increased error robustness.
