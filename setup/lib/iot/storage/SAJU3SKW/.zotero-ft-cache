Abstract

The communication layer is considered as the backbone of the IoT systems. It is the main channel between the application layer and different operating activities in the IoT system. The whole physical system is loaded with amounts of data and information that need to be shared with other nodes. Therefore, it is needed to set up a suitable connection network among these nodes through a communication protocol. The communication could be wire-connected or wireless based on the protocol defined by the designer. Moreover, networks are very vital components in IoT to connect things to the outside world of internet. IoT requires an intelligent network infrastructure. Any IoT hardware can connect to the internet via the following [1–17]:
