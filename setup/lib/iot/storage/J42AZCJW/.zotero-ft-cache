Abstract:  	Services are part of our daily activities, such as the emergence of new solutions powered by cutting-edge technologies such as Fog Computing. Fog computing, new ideas for the cloud in the network, is considered the suitable platforms for the Internet of Things services and many applications. This fog cloud computing integration is not directly moving forward.Some services required ultra-low latency like e-Health, public safety. Unnecessary communication loads not only the core network but also the data center that it ﬁnds. To do this, fog nodes can pre-process the data before sending it to the cloud. Smart Gateways are suitable candidates for service deployment. This paper presents a design of a service-oriented architecture using smart gateways as fog nodes which reduce service latency.
