Abstract— The CDMA service coverage is split into different cells. If the available resource in a cell is not sufficient to supply the user’s requirement, that cell becomes a hot-spot. As a result, the call will be clogged. The hot-spot causes the high blocking probability. Therefore, various methods including channel borrowing, cell overlaying, adaptive cell sectorization and so on, have been mentioned in many papers. In this paper, we proposed a beam reassignment method (BR) to diminish the call-blocking probability of one hot-beam and multi-service CDMA. A simulation result shows the effectiveness of the BR method in a hot-spot in two and three service-classes.
Keywords— blocking probability, hot-beam, hot-spot, multiservice, CDMA, beam reassignment.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recent growth in mobile telephone traffic in wireless cellular networks, along with the limitation of resource available, presents a challenge for the efficient use of system capability. The optimization problem will be highly complex if one or more cells in the network become “hot-spot” for some periods of time. For example, the bandwidth resources currently available in those cells are not sufficient to sustain the needs of current users in the cells.
Several schemes have proposed to handle the hot-spot situation: cell splitting, channel sharing, and antenna tilt [1-3]. However, those methods only apply to mobile communication systems using isotropic antennas.
We had considered the CDMA system using smart antennas with switched beamforming (SBF) technique and beam reassignment method. The SBF technique uses multiple beams to cover a whole cell. Hot-spot beam is called hot-beam [4].
This paper presents beam reassignment method to reduce the blocking probability in multi-service CDMA. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related works. Section 3 introduces the formulae used for beam reassignment method in the case of two and three service classes. Section 4 shows the numerical results and some analyses. Finally, some conclusions are given in section 5.

II. RELATED WORKS Many researchers have proposed various methods to relieve the blocking of hot-spot such as channel borrowing, cell overlaying [5], and adaptive cell sectorization [6]. In the paper of Christian Hartman [7], the author investigates the blocking probability of CDMA systems without the present of hot-beam. In addition, Hyunduk Kang in [4] proposed the beam reassignment method to reduce the blocking probability in case of one hot-beam and single service class. However, the main drawback is that all the papers did not show the method to handle the case of one hot-beam and multiple service classes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the formulae as well as the simulation for beam reassignment method in the case of two and three service-classes to handle the drawback.
III. BEAM REASSIGNMENT METHOD IN CASE OF MULTIPLE SERVICE CLASSES
We examine the CDMA system with n different classes and model an antenna beam pattern by a brick wall antenna beam pattern as shown in figure 1.
Fig. 1. Brickwall antenna pattern.
Where α is the main beamwidth and D is the sidelobe attenuation of the antenna.
In the CDMA system, to admit new users, we maintain the minimum / (the energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio) which denoted as .

For a user of service class j (j=1,2,…,n),  is the spreading

factor,  is the number of active users inside the main beam

of the new user, and  is those outside the main beam ( +

 = 2).

We can calculate the blocking probability of a CDMA

system from equation (2). For example, we consider the CDMA

system with one hot-beam and two service-classes, as shown in

figure 2.

Where

χH

and

χL

are the offered traffic loads

of the hot-beam and each lightly loaded beam, respectively.

P(N1α = k1; χH ) stand for the probability that the number of

active users in hot-beam with an angular sector of width α is

equal to  (for the first service class). We apply probability for the Poisson distributions then we can calculate this value by

using the following equation:

P( N1α

(χH )k1 k1 !

We have a similar approach for P(N2α = k2; χH ) , P(N1α = k1; χL ) and P(N2α = k2; χL ) .

We examine in the case that beam 0 is a hot-beam and the

other beams are lightly loaded-beams. The BR method was

applied by switching all beams in the counterclockwise

direction to the new position with the ratio angle “r” to handle

the hot-spots case. We should choose the value of r so that the

blocking probability of the hot-beam as lower as possible.

We will cover the BR method as shown in figure 3 with the value of r = 0.5. We have two new hot-beams with the same admissible probability after the BR method. These beams share the load between the original hot-beam and lightly-loaded beam. It’s mean that the offered traffic load of the new hotbeam for each service class is:

First, we need the flowchart to determine the admissible probability  , then the blocking probability  = 1 −  before implementing Matlab code. We have suggested the flowchart to calculate the admissible probability of hot-beam in
case of two service-classes in figure 4.
In the same way, we will have a flowchart to find out the
admissible probability for each lightly loaded-beam, and new
hot-beam in two service-classes and three service-classes,
respectively.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
We execute the Matlab code for two cases: one hot-beam with two service-classes and three service-classes. Moreover, we develop the graphical user interface in figure 5 so that users can visualize the blocking probability. The GUI allows the users to change all the system values such as main beam width, SNIR and so on.
In this paper, we evaluate the performance of beam reassignment method by calculating the blocking probability of the hot-beam and the lightly loaded beam before and after beam rotation. Table 1 (using first value) and Table 2 provide the values for the system parameters, figure 6 and figure 7 show the result.

268

Some experiments will take from few days to few weeks when we increase the values of the system parameters. We choose the small values of spreading gain in the case of three service-classes due to limited time.

Fig. 5. The graphical user interface to visualize the blocking probability.
Furthermore, we simulated the proposed formulae on the following system: Intel Core i7 8700 - CPU 3.2 GHz; RAM 16 Gigabytes; Microsoft Windows 10 64 bits.

Figure 6 represents blocking probabilities before and after the BR method in case of one hot-beam and two service-classes ( α = 450 ; s1 = 96; s2 = 48;ξ = 2 ).
Figure 7 shows blocking probability of hot-beam with the case of one hot- beam and three service-classes ( α = 150 ; s1 = 32; s2 = 24; s3 = 16;ξ = 1.2 ).
We can observe that the blocking probability of the new hotbeam is less than the original one and higher than the blocking probability of the lightly loaded beam. For example, in figure 6, given the offered traffic loads of service class 1 (A1=10) and service class 2 (A2=10), the value of blocking probability of the hot-beam, lightly loaded beam and new hot-beam are 0.0631; 0027; 0.0186 respectively.

decrease means better performance. We can see clearly that the percentage decrease varies across
the system parameters. There is a significant change when we increase the value of SNIR from 5dB to 6dB. The percentage decrease between the new hot-beam and the original hot-beam is 28.89 percent with the first value of SNIR, while the percentage decrease is 19.02 percent with the second value of SNIR. It means that the performance of the BR method decreases when we increase the value of SNIR.

Fig. 6. The blocking probability before and after the BR method in case of one hot-beam and two service-classes.
The BR method works for all the cases. After the beam rotation, the blocking probability of the hot-beam is reduced.
To evaluate the BR method in more detail, we change each of the system parameters in table 1 (using second value) and get the result in table 3.
In table 3, column 1 denotes the value change of system parameters. Column 2 to 4 show the blocking probability of hotbeam, light beam, and new hot-beam respectively. Column 5 describes the percentage of new hot-beam, compared with the original one. Column 6 indicates the decrease by percentage of blocking probability of the original hot-beam using the BR method. In the last column, the higher value of percentage

V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper has already proposed the formulae to evaluate the BR method in case of multiple service classes. We reduce the blocking of the original hot- beam and use the BR method to solve the hot-spot problem.
We will consider the value of ratio angle in the near future. We will suggest the formula to calculate the blocking probability with an arbitrary value of ratio angle using the BR method.
We increase the sidelobe attenuation and the normalizing power value to increase the performance of the BR method. Reducing the interference, the main beamwidth, and SNIR will make the same effect.
