Abstract—Full duplex (FD) radios in cognitive radio (CR) networks enable secondary users (SUs) to perform sensing and transmission simultaneously, and improve the utilization of spectrum. In general, cooperation between the nodes enhances the detection performance through spatial diversity. However, secondary transmission co-exists with the cooperation procedure for FD-SUs, and degrades the sensing performance when secondary transmit power is high. In this paper, we propose the sensing framework for FD-SUs in a cooperative environment, and present the analytical formulation of sensing and utilization of spectrum (UoS) performance for FD-SUs. It is demonstrated that the self-interference, secondary transmit power, PU activity, number of cooperative users, and the sensing outcomes have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the sensing and UoS performance.
Index Terms—Cognitive radio, full duplex, utilization of spectrum, cooperative sensing.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cognitive radio (CR) networks exploit the dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) and spectrum diversity, and enhance the spectrum utilization efﬁciency. In CR networks, sum rate and the utilization of spectrum by users can be improved by choosing the optimal sensing operating points [1]. The full-duplex (FD)-enabled nodes can perform sensing and transmission simultaneously (in a given time-slot), and can use the spectral opportunity uninterruptedly and continuously [2]. Thus, FDCR networks have a great potential to further enhance the efﬁciency of spectrum utilization and increase the overall network capacity. However, FD-CR networks are achieved with increased energy consumption and hardware complexity. The major limitation of FD mode is the self-interference (SI). The SI suppression (SIS) and SI cancellation (SIC) techniques help to implement the radical FD-CR systems. The performance of FD-radios highly depends on the SI mitigation capabilities. Excessive SI can lead to the reduced capacity even below that of half-duplex (HD) systems.
In this paper, we consider the cooperation-based sensing framework for FD-SU TXs. Unlike HD mode (which has TDMA based separation between the sensing and transmission procedures), sensing duration for FD-SU TXs is no longer limited, and can be extended to the entire frame duration. In such case, secondary transmission interferes the cooperation procedure, and degrades the sensing performance when secondary transmit power is high. We then formulate

the utilization of spectrum (UoS) performance for different interference levels of secondary transmissions.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We assume that the activity of PU is modeled by a two-state (semi-) Markov process. The random variables representing the duration of OF F and ON states follow exponential distribution. Moreover, FD-SU TXs consist of imperfect SIS enabled two narrow-band antennas, i.e., receiving antenna (Ant − 1) to perform the sensing, and transmitting antenna (Ant − 2) to transmit when spectral opportunity is available [3]. The considered time-slotted frame structure for FD-SU TXs is shown in Fig. 1, in which sensing duration (in each frame) is divided into g consecutive short same-length sensing slots (TS.0, TS.1,... and TS.g−1). The PU state is assumed to be consistent in each sensing slot. The number of samples in each sensing slot is N , and is expressed as M/g, where M is the number of total samples in each frame. The ﬁrst sensing-slot (in each frame) is HD. If a PU is not detected, FDSU TX initiates its transmission and sensing simultaneously. Otherwise, FD-SU TX do not transmit and continues to perform the sensing procedure until channel is available in the next frame. Similarly, if a PU is detected at the end of any FD sensing slot, FD-SU TX aborts its transmission until the next frame. The motivation behind the considered timeslotted frame structure is to account for tradeoff between the sensing efﬁciency and timeliness in detecting the PU [3]. The sensed signal during FD sensing slots is corrupted by a SI signal. We consider energy detection (ED) [4]–[6] method for sensing, and the sensing procedure is formulated for both (HD and FD) types of sensing slots.

III. COOPERATION BASED SENSING FRAMEWORK FOR FD-SU TXS
We consider a PU-TX, a fusion center (F C), and k number of F D − SU T Xs (F D − SU T X1, F D − SU T X2,. . . , F D − SU T Xk), as shown in Fig. 2. In each time-slot, F D − SU T Xs perform sensing, and send sensing results to F C for a ﬁnal decision [1]. There are two potential signal sources, i.e., PU-TX and F D − SU T X1. Hence, we deﬁne four tests of hypothesis. The received signal at F D −SU T X1 and at any other F D − SU T Xi (i = 2,..., k) can be written as,

The sensing performance either under the QoS constraint

for PU or SU can be formulated [7]. We consider the sensing

performance subject to a QoS constraint for PU, i.e., probabil-

ity of detection is set at a desired value, and the probability of

false alarm is obtained. Substituting the statistical properties

under each hypothesis given in Table 1 & 2, receiver operating

characteristics (ROCs) for local sensing at F D −SU T X1 and F D − SU T Xi (i = 2, ..., k) (during HD and FD sensing

slots) are given in equations (4) – (7),

We assume that the local sensing results at F C, and

bining rule (OR) is considered to combine the local sensing

results. The OR rule increases the protection level to PU,

but also results in the lower spectrum utilization [1]. The

IV. UTILIZATION OF SPECTRUM (UOS)
We present an analytical formulation of utilization of spectrum (UoS) scheme for FD-SU TXs. The UoS performance is evaluated by ﬁnding out the average number of sensing slots, (τ ), used for the successful communication in each frame. The probability of detecting spectral holes in only ﬁrst z number of sensing slots in each frame can be deﬁned as,

PH (z) = P1 (z) − P2 (z + 1)

(8)

Here, P1 (z) refers to possible scenarios where spectral opportunity is detected in greater or equal to z number of sensing slots. Similarly, P2 (z + 1) refers to possible scenarios where spectral opportunity is detected in greater or equal to z + 1 number of sensing slots. Hence, P1 (z) is expressed as,

Fig. 3. Comparison of ROCs for different sensing slots, i.e., HD (conventional), and FD (with different secondary transmit powers).

P1 (z) = POF F 1 − P FFHCD z 1 − P FFFCD j

(9)

j=1

The number of transmitted bits are adjusted as per the z number of sensing slots to consider same bit error rate (BER) in each frame. The probability of obtaining an errored secondary packet, owing to channel errors, is expressed as [3],

Perror(z) = 1 − 1 − BER (γs) zB

(10)

where zB is the packet size for z number of sensing-slots, γs is the SNR of the secondary transmission.
Thus, the average number of sensing slots (in each frame) used for the successful communication are expressed as,

∞

τ = zPH (z) 1 − Perror(z)

(11)

z=1

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For numerical results, the set parameters are; zB=1000 bits for z=1, BER= 0.00025, X=.01, and secondary transmit power (σs22 ) = [10dB, 20dB]. Fig.3 shows sensing performance during the HD (conventional) and FD sensing-slots. The sensed signals during FD sensing slots are corrupted with the SI signals. The inﬂuence of secondary transmission power over sensing performance is shown. The results illustrate that when transmit power is high, sensing performance suffers due to severe interference. Fig. 4 shows the UoS performance in term of average number of sensing slots used for successful communication (in each frame). The results validate the performance degradation in term of less number of transmitting sensing slots when transmit power (interference level) increases.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we considered the sensing framework for FDSUs in a cooperative environment, and investigated the impact of secondary transmit power on the cooperation procedure, and hence on the sensing and UoS performance. The results validated a need to identify the optimal values of cooperative users and secondary transmit powers (subject to considered sensing parameters) for the optimal sensing and UoS performance.
