Abstract—In this paper, we propose a threshold secret sharing scheme for secure communications even in the absence of eavesdropper channel state information. In the proposed scheme, the secret data is divided into Nmin parts by polynomial of degree T − 1 and transmits to the target user through multiple spatial dimensions by beamforming. The divided secret data at the user can be reconstructed with a sufﬁcient number (≥ T ) of parts by using the Lagrange interpolating polynomial. The numerical results show that eavesdropping probability of the proposed scheme is better than those of the considered conventional schemes.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, wireless transmission is inherently vulnerable to eavesdropping due to the broadcast nature of a radio propagation [1]-[5]. Even though a large number of security measures – from wired equivalent privacy (WEP) to transport layer security (TLS) – throughout the network layers are developed and already widely deployed, they now face considerable challenges by attackers with immense computing powers acquirable from the cloud and quantum computer.
As one of the new attempt to overcome this problem, physical layer security (PLS) has been introduced as an alternative security method to achieve fundamental secrecy in physical layer. With a single antenna conﬁguration, Wyner ﬁrst introduced a wiretap channel and the secrecy, the results of which show the feasibility of secure communication [1]. Also, PLS with multiple antennas has been studied [3]-[5]. In MIMO network, by beamforming and jamming techniques, the secrecy can be provided even though the quality of the main channel is worse than the quality of the eavesdropping channel. Most of existing works have focused only on increasing the secrecy rate by beamforming and jamming design, assuming that transmitter knows the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper. However, it is impossible to obtain the CSI of the eavesdropper due to the passive posture. Therefore, to ensure secrecy against passive eavesdropper, new transmission technique with multiple spatial dimensions is needed in the absence of an eavesdropping channel.
In this paper, we propose a threshold secret sharing transmission for secure communications. In the proposed scheme, the secret data is divided into Nmin parts using polynomial of degree T − 1 and transmits to the user through multiple

spatial dimensions by a transmit beamforming. At the user, based on the Lagrange interpolating polynomial, the secret data can be recovered when a sufﬁcient number (≥ T ) of parts are combined together. Also, we propose the majority rule for secret reconstruction to overcome the channel fading and noise in wireless network. At the eavesdropper, it is difﬁcult to estimate the T parts correctly due to the difference between main channel and eavesdropping channel in physical layer. Therefore, attempt to reconstruct the secret data is generally unsuccessful. The numerical results show that the eavesdropping probability of the proposed approach is better than those of the considered conventional approaches.

II. THRESHOLD SECRET SHARING TRANSMISSION
A. System Model
As shown in Fig. 1, we considers MIMO wireless network with a base station (BS) with Nt transmit antennas, a target user (TU) with Nr receive antennas, and an eavesdropper (EA) with Ne receive antennas. When BS transmits a secret data over the channel matrix H to the TU, the radio signal is exposed to the EA over the cross channel G. Then, the received signal at the target user can be written as

y = Hx + n,

(1)

where y, x, and n denotes a received signal vector, a transmitted signal vector, and AWGN vector, respectively. Also, the eavesdropping signal can be written as

z = Gx + w,

(2)

where z and w denotes a received signal vector and AWGN vector at the EA, respectively.

B. Spatial Dimensions with Beamforming
For designing a transmit beamforming and receive combining efﬁciently, we assumed that perfect CSI of H is available at the BS. If the BS also has the perfect CSI of the eavesdropping channel G, a secure signal transmission can be possible with transmit beamforming (e.g. Zero-Forcing Beamforming) to nullify the eavesdropping channel. However, it is impossible to obtain the eavesdropping CSI due to the

Divided parts are modulated with a modulation scheme (ex. QPSK, QAM) and then the modulated parts are transmitted through spatial dimensions with beamforming in (3) as

y = H · V · x + n,

where x = [S˜1, S˜2, ..., S˜Nmin ]T and S˜i denotes the i-th modulated secret part.

passive posture of the EA. Therefore, without any information
about the eavesdropping channel, transmit beamforming is
generally designed for maximizing the spectral efﬁciency or
improving the reliability.
With CSI of H, spatial dimensions are generally obtained
by singular value decomposition (SVD). The SVD of channel H = UDV† can be performed, where U ∈ CNr×Nr , V ∈ CNt×Nt are unitary matrices, a√nd D ∈ CNr×Nt is a diagonal matrix whose non-zero entries λi are the square roots of the eigenvalues of H†H. With the transmit beamforming matrix V and the receive combining matrix U†, the combined signals
can be rewritten as

U†y= U† · U D V† · V x + U†n,

y˜= Dx + n˜.

Since U is unitary matrix, noise vector n˜ and n have the same distribution. Then, the i-th combined signal of y˜ can be obtained as

D. Reconstruction of the Secret

With the receive combining matrix U† and the channel

compensation of the received parts in (4), the demodulated secret parts [Sˆ1, Sˆ2, ..., SˆNmin ] can be obtained at the target user. With Nmin demodulated parts, the target user randomly chooses a subset composed of T parts (ex. [S˜1, S˜2, ..., S˜T ])

and estimates the Lagrange interpolating polynomial in (5) as

where ij, ik means the index parameter of a subset. Then, ideally, the secret data can be obtained by fˆ(0) = Kˆ .
However, since secret parts are transmitted with fading channel and noise in MIMO wireless network, the reconstruction of the secret must be considered with demodulation error. In other words, the derived result in (7) can be changed depends on how the user chooses a subset. In the proposed scheme, the number of subset (Ns) is

Ns =Nmin CT ,

y˜i = λixi + n˜i, i = 1, ..., Nmin,

where Nmin = min(Nt, Nr). From (4), it is apparent that the MIMO wireless channel has been transformed into independent Nmin spatial dimensions by a transmit beamforming and a receive combining.

where C denotes combination function. Therefore, a set ( ) of the estimated secret data Kˆ is also obtained as = {Kˆ1, Kˆ2, ..., KˆNs } and the secret data is ﬁnally determined by majority rule of .
III. EAVESDROPPER BEHAVIOR

C. Threshold Secret Sharing Transmission
Threshold secret sharing is a conventional scheme in cryptography created by Adi Sharmir [6]. In the scheme, a secret data is divided into n parts by a polynomial of degree t − 1. To reconstruct the secret data, t out of n parts must be needed for solving the polynomial problem correctly. Therefore, this is called the (t, n)-threshold secret sharing scheme [7]-[9].
With the conventional scheme in MIMO wireless network, the i-th part with a polynomial can be obtained as
Si = f (i) = (a0 + a1i + ... + aT −1iT −1)mod p, (5)
where coefﬁcient a0 is the original secret data K while other coefﬁcient a1, a2, ..., aT −1 are all randomly chosen at the BS. And p and T are a large prime number greater than any of the coefﬁcients and a system parameter to control the security strength, respectively. We assumed that the value of p is preshared with BS and TU for secure communications.

For eavesdropping efﬁciently, channel information about H and G are needed at the EA. First, based on the channel estimation technique, EA knows G from pilot and preamble signals of BS. Also, we assumed that EA can be obtained H and p by eavesdropping the TU’s channel feedback and the exchanged information for secure data transmission.
With channel information of H, EA predicts V for target user by the SVD of H. Therefore, for efﬁcient eavesdropping, the eavesdropping signal in (2) can be combined using the receive matrix Ue considering channel compensation as

Ue · z = Ue · G · V · x + Ue · w = De · x + w˜ , (9)

where

Ue

=

(G·V)−1 ||G·V)||

and

De

denotes

the

diagonal

matrix

through the inverse matrix operation. Then, the transmitted

secret parts are estimated by compensation of De. Finally, the

secret data can be obtained by the same procedure of the secret

reconstruction in section II.D.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we provide the symbol-error-rate (SER) and eavesdropping probability (EP) numerical results of the proposed secret sharing scheme. For simulation, MIMO wireless channels are considered as shown in Fig. 1, where the channel coefﬁcients are assumed to be ﬂat Rayleigh fading with mutually independent and additive white Gaussian noise terms having zero mean and equivalent variance CN(0, σ2). We compare the threshold secret sharing scheme (TS) with spatial multiplexing transmission (SM) [10] and diversity transmission (Div) [11]. The speciﬁc parameters are indicated at each ﬁgure.
In Fig. 3, the SER versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the TU is evaluated for different approaches. We can see that TS achieves better performance compared with SM. Especially, in high SNR region, it achieves same diversity gain compared with Div because the TS can recover the secret data by majority rule even though there are some miss-decoded parts due to the low eigenvalues in (4). We can see that SER performance is determined by a gap between a threshold value and Nmin. If a threshold value becomes closer to Nmin, the performance of the TS becomes closer to that of SM because the secret data can be reconstructed only when all parts are successfully decoded to solve the polynomial. Also, if a threshold value becomes closer to 1, the performance of the TS becomes closer to that of Div because the secret data can be obtained easily by solving the polynomial with a small number of parts.
In Fig. 4, we evaluate the performance of EP at the eavesdropper under different SNR. The proposed TS shows good performance against eavesdropping compared with SM and Div, especially in low SNR region. Since the transmit beamforming V is designed considering H only, a gain of the effective eavesdropping channel G · V is generally degraded compared to a gain of the effective main channel H · V in physical layer. Therefore, in the proposed scheme, EA is difﬁcult to estimate the sufﬁcient number (≥ T ) of parts correctly and fails to reconstruct the secret data.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we consider a threshold secret sharing to enhance physical layer security against an eavesdropper. The simulation shows that the eavesdropping probability of the proposed scheme is better than those of the conventional approaches. Also, since there is an inverse proportion between SER and EP, it is necessary to set an appropriate threshold value according to the service type and purpose.
