The Race Is On!

The race to digital services revenue is underway, and competition is coming from all sides: not just traditional service providers, but from established cloud providers (Amazon, Google, Microsoft) and over-the-top (OTT) applications you haven’t even heard of yet. Consumers and corporations have made it clear that whoever can deliver the next big thing in digital services will win their business, whether it’s their mobile service provider or Amazon or some cloud start-up. Instead of the big eating the small, in the new digital services economy, the fast will eat the slow.
OTT competitors have already made an aggressive bid for traditional telco services, with McKinsey & Company predicting that OTT market share for messaging and mobile voice services could reach as high as 60 percent and 25 percent, respectively, by the end of this year.1 Now, the race is on to win the coveted enterprise and 5G digital services markets that will support next-generation applications such as smart buildings and immersive/augmented gaming experiences.
To compete, communications service providers (CSP) need to transform their networks and transform their business now. Replacing legacy solutions with “lift and shift” virtualized replacements from the same vendors won’t win the race. CSPs need a web-scale, cloudnative network architecture that is built to deliver next-gen digital services from the ground up. These networks must deliver ultra-high performance and advanced features such as network slicing, service automation and real-time analytics that can radically accelerate service creation and drive down network costs.

We’re not talking about future features on a roadmap. We’re talking about technology that is available today from leading vendors and should be implemented by CSPs as soon as possible to compete effectively for digital services revenue. The time for action is now, and the best course of action is to follow the five proven strategies for ensuring the success of your digital services transformation:
The Five Proven Strategies for Winning
1. Maximize your network’s speed and performance with network solutions that are architected specifically for an NFV/cloud environment.
2. Rev up your top-line revenue and bottom-line profitability by accelerating your time to market for new services and lowering your total cost of ownership.
3. Drive transformation with a complete solution that is already built to win. 4. Don’t get behind the wheel of an unproven concept. 5. Recognize that you can’t win the race alone, team with a proven partner.
Strategy #1: Maximize Your Speed and Performance
In the race ahead, network speed and performance will be critical. Mobile traffic growth rates, which currently stand at about 50% year over year, are poised to explode in the next few years as much as 1000%. Mobile service providers need a different model for scaling their networks: one that relies on software rather than hardware to cost-effectively grow the network. Virtualized network functions (VNFs) that are built for cloud/NFV environments, rather than adapted to them, deliver higher levels of speed and performance, which in turn helps mobile service providers scale better while lowering their cost per bit.

Affirmed Networks and Intel have been working closely together to improve the speed and performance of VNFs in the mobile core. As a result of that partnership, Affirmed and Intel recently announced record-breaking performance benchmarks with Affirmed vEPC that reached speeds 10X higher than competitive alternatives—over 150 Gbps on a single Intel Xeon server and more than 120 Gbps on a single Intel server with 100% DPI utilization.

Figure 1. Intel/Affirmed Networks Test Results
Beyond its impressive speed and performance, the Affirmed/Intel solution delivered linear scalability as more servers were added. This is a critical component of a web-scale architecture, as high-bandwidth applications such as augmented/virtual reality and connected cars will require the rapid and efficient scaling of network resources. Affirmed’s vEPC solution provides independent scaling of control, management and data planes, so mobile service providers can allocate resources appropriately for different call models such as fixed wireless, enterprise and consumer services, and both low- and high-throughput machine-to-machine (M2M) communications.

Strategy #2: Rev Up Your Revenue, from Top-Line Growth to Bottom-Line Profitability.
CSPs need to reduce capex and opex to improve their bottom line and increase revenue from new services to grow their top line. In a recent in-depth study, ACG Research compared Affirmed’s integrated vEPC solution with a virtualized EPC solution comprised of discrete components from different vendors but with similar features—e.g., DPI, GiLAN services, CGNAT, optimization services and virtual probes. What ACG found was that Affirmed’s integrated vEPC solution offered a significant advantage in terms of total cost of ownership (TCO) over a five-year period. In addition, ACG analyzed how CSPs could increase the speed of creating new services while reducing the cost of delivering those services by automating the service provisioning process using platforms such as the Affirmed’s Service Automation Platform, ASAP.

Figure 3. Affirmed’s integrated vEPC vs. discrete multivendor vEPC
ACG’s study concluded that:
• Over a five-year period, Affirmed’s vEPC solution demonstrated a 70 percent lower total cost of ownership, including a 70 percent savings in capex and a 90 percent savings in opex
• A discrete multivendor vEPC would require 10X more servers than Affirmed’s vEPC • CSPs can reduce opex costs of creating and delivering a new services by as much as 80
percent with automated service provisioning • Automation can reduce the time to deliver a service by one third and increase revenue
from new services (because you are launching more of them) by as much as 300%

Strategy #3: Have a Solution That’s Built to Win.
Traditional network equipment vendors would have you believe that strapping a rocket onto a minivan will transform it into a race car. In reality, their virtualized solutions are simply the same old software in a cheaper chassis. What CSPs need instead is a network designed for the race of the future, that combines the speed and agility required to outmaneuver cloud-based competitors, accelerate innovation and capture both emerging and niche markets.
What does this network of the future look like? It’s not just virtualized but cloud-native, scaling to serve thousands of enterprise customers while offering granular customization of services. It introduces unique capabilities (e.g., automation, real-time network intelligence, microservices-based architecture) to drive disruption, while embracing an open architecture and APIs to easily integrate with partners and third-party applications. It’s not just cheaper and faster than what you have today, but 10X faster than your competitors and 70% less expensive to operate than competitive offerings.

Figure 4. Affirmed’s webscale 5G solution provides a robust set of virtualized capabilities that reduces costs and accelerates revenue opportunities.
Where can you find this network of the future? It’s the cloud-based mobile core solution that Affirmed delivers today.

“The Affirmed decision to offer their virtual EPC on AWS could be a step toward a true virtual mobile infrastructure.” –Tom Nolle, president and founder of CIMI Corporation
• Network Slicing. Network slicing enables operators to configure virtual network instances that are optimized for a specific customer or service more quickly and at a lower cost. Affirmed’s virtual Slice Selection Function (vSSF) creates finely grained slices of network traffic across virtualized and legacy network elements without heavy provisioning or configuration changes.
• Virtual Probes and Real-Time Network Analytics. Probe-based network intelligence isn’t a new concept, but Affirmed is the only company to offer a fully virtualized network probe integrated within the VNF, providing real-time network intelligence without impacting the performance of the VNF. It’s a revolutionary approach to network intelligence that can save service providers an additional 50% in capex and opex costs, by eliminating the need for additional probe-based appliances.
• Automated Service Provisioning. The Affirmed Service Automation Platform (ASAP) automates the creation, provisioning, modification and deployment of services, reducing the time-to-market for new services from years or months to just days. ASAP includes open northbound APIs to simplify integration with OSS/BSS systems and a customizable southbound interface to deliver services to any device in your network. Using Affirmed’s real-time analytics tools, CSPs can quickly identify and create

profitable, new services by anticipating market opportunities well before their competition.
• Integrated DPI and GiLAN Services. The Affirmed vEPC platform includes deep packet inspection (DPI) and GiLAN services to create new services and policies. The GiLAN services features a comprehensive set of capabilities such as proxy, video optimization, TCP acceleration, CGNAT, data plane visibility and analytics that can be chained together to create new policy-driven services in minutes.
• IoT Applications. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications represent a multibilliondollar opportunity for CSPs. Affirmed’s vEPC architecture is optimized to support IoT applications, with features such as: • Network slicing to support traffic segregation, with each slice capable of being optimized for a particular service; • Separation of control and user plane to support critical IoT applications (e.g., healthcare, emergency services); • Support of both wideband LTE-M and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) services and support for Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) with enhanced Service Capability Exposure Function (eSCEF).
• Multi-Access Architecture with Virtualized Wi-Fi. Affirmed’s Wi-Fi solutions provide operators with an inexpensive way to offload the growing volumes of mobile data traffic while improving indoor coverage and the overall subscriber experience. Affirmed offers the only fully virtualized ePDG and TWAG/TWAP functions that perform all IPSec encryption in software.
• Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS). As operators move to 5G, they will have to accommodate a wider variety of applications from a centralized mobile core architecture. CUPS provides independent scaling and placement of data plane and control plane functionality, avoiding wasteful overprovisioning of VNFs and allowing for placement of the user-plane VNFs closer to the edge of the network to support lowlatency, high-bandwidth applications and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC).
• Support for 5G New Radio (NR) Standard. Affirmed’s vEPC supports 5G NR, which provides major improvements in performance, cost and efficiency when compared to legacy wireless technology.
• Cloud-Native Microservices Architecture. Microservices enable CSPs to quickly and cost-effectively deliver customized network slices to their customer base. Using opensource technologies such as Kubernetes and Prometheus, the cloud-native solution can drive down network operational costs by delivering a standardized tool set for network monitoring, API management and orchestration.
