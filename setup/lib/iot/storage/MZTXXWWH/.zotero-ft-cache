I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, free space optical (FSO) communication has been actively researched as a solution to a limited spectrum of radio frequency (RF) based communication. FSO has superiority in terms of data rate and security compared to RF communication. However, its performance is deteriorated due to pointing error that the detector and the beam trajectory are misaligned each other and atmospheric turbulence where the refractive index is not consistent due to the air ﬂow [1]. Especially, pointing error has two components, ﬁxed displacement between the beam center and the center of detection plane (i.e. boresight) and random offset of the beam center at the detector plane (i.e. jitter) [2]. In the past, the application target of FSO was focused on ﬁxed platforms like buildings. However, since application targets have expanded to communication between ﬁxed and mobile platforms or mobile platforms in recent years, boresight as well as jitter needs to be considered. In this paper, we derive outage probability for a system based on the heterodyne detection technique when boresight and jitter exist in strong turbulence situation and compared the impact of boresight and jitter on outage probability by numerical results.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
In this paper, the optical signal is transmitted to the receiver through strong atmospheric turbulence and white Gaussian noise, in the presence of pointing error. The received optical signal is converted into an electrical signal by photodetector and can be expressed as

y = ηhx + n,

(1)

where x is the transmitted signal, η is the effective photoelectric conversion ratio, and n is AWGN with variance N0. h is the channel gain and can be modeled as product of ha and

hp which are the atmospheric fading factor and the pointing error factor, respectively. ha and hp are independent random variables and each random variable is modeled as follows.
We consider strong turbulence and ha can be modeled as a Gamma-Gamma random variable whose PDF can be given as

where Γ (·) denotes Gamma function [3, eq.(8.310.1)], Kv (·) is the v th-order modiﬁed Bessel function of the second

kind [3, eq.(8.432.2)], and α, β are the effective number of

small-scale and large-scale eddies of scattering environment,

respectively.

We assume a Gaussian beam propagating from transmitter to

receiver and the fraction of the collected power at the receiver

can be approximated as hp (r; z) ≈ A0 exp

[4]. r

is the radial displacement between the beam center and the

detector center and it can be expressed as r = x2 + y2,

where x and y are the horizontal and the vertical Gaussian displacement, respectively (i.e. x ∼ N (µx, σ2) and y ∼ N (µy, σ2)). Then, the PDF of hp can be given as

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
From Figure 1, the effect of jitter on outage probability can be seen and higher jitter value σ degrades performance of FSO system in case of heterodyne detection technique. We can see the difference between outage probabilities with no boresight, moderate boresight, and strong boresight. It can be observed that the outage probability increases with increasing boresight value when the SNR threshold γ0 is ﬁxed. Also, since change of boresight value leads to greater gap than those of jitter, borsight has much more impact in terms of outage probability than jitter.

performance degradation due to boresight and jitter. First, the outage probability increases with greater boresight value and also the jitter deteriorate the outage probability. In particular, presence of the boresight degraded much more performance than the jitter.
