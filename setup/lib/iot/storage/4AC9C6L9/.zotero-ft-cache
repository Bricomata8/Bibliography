Abstract—This paper discussed about the detection of random access attack in IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks. In IEEE 802.15.4, the medium access control mechanism is designed based on carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) with exponential backoff. When an IEEE 802.15.4 device has very small backoff, it takes higher priority to get the channel compared to the other conventional IEEE 802.15.4 devices. This obviously degrades the network throughput performance of normal IEEE 802.15.4 devices. This paper presents the analysis of the impacts and proposes the method for detecting the malicious selﬁsh backoff attacker via logistic classiﬁcation.
I. INTRODUCTION
In carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CS)-based wireless networks, security over wireless medium access is one of the active research topics nowadays. Furthermore, this paper is focusing on IEEE 802.15.4 lowpower wireless personal area networks (LR-WPAN) which is deﬁnitely beneﬁcial in terms of power/energy management and thus it is good to be used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and wearable computing systems. In CSMA/CA, when multiple devices content the channel at the same time, they will move to backoff stage where the backoff timer will be randomly selected within the given backoff interval based on exponential backoff mechanisms.
Suppose that a malicious/selﬁsh device sets its own backoff timer to be very small (named to selﬁsh backoff ). This means the selﬁsh device can access the channel faster than the others since the selﬁsh device can take the channel with higher priority. This will eventually lead to the performance degradation in the entire network. This is called selﬁsh backoff attack in this paper.
This paper presents the results of mathematical throughput analysis in CSMA/CA with exponential random backoff (details are in [1]); and also proposes a method to detect malicious/selﬁsh attackers via logistic classiﬁcation. In addition, this paper is doing mathematical analysis for the selﬁsh backoff attack; and simulates the impacts on the performance in the wireless networks.
As one promising application, micro-grid user communications with IEEE 802.15.4-based low-power IoT networking capabilities are of our interests. In micro-grid systems, users are exchanging their information via wireline or wireless technologies. For this purpose, secure communications and networking are deﬁnitely required.

II. BIANCHI’S IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA [1]

The details of CSMA/CA mathematical analysis are brieﬂy

introduced in [1]. This paper introduces the basic concept of

the analysis and presents the analysis result. As presented

in [1], CSMA/CA can be represented as the discrete-time

Markov chain.

Then, the probability that a node transmits in a randomly

chosen time (τ ) can be eventually calculated. Notice that τerb is the probability that a node transmits in a randomly chosen time

with exponential random backoff. Regardless of the backoff

stage, any transmission occurs when the backoff counter is 0.

Then, τerb can be computed as follows:

2

τerb(p) = (W + 1) + pW

. m i=−01(2p)i

(1)

where p and W stand for packet collision probability (p ∈ (0, 1) [1]) and CWmin (i.e., minimum contention window size), respectively.
Notice that more details about this result are well-discussed in [1]; and the analysis in this paper is based on the theory.

III. SELFISH BACKOFF ATTACK
A. An Overview of Selﬁsh Backoff Attack
Among all devices with IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA, when one is using selﬁsh backoff strategies, it can be harmful for the other networked devices. Suppose that a selﬁsh device (i.e., attacker) is setting its CWmin and CWmax to 1. Then, when the attacker contents the channel with the other devices, it always wins the game because it can occupy the channel at the ﬁrst time slot while the other devices are waiting to carrier-sense the channel. Then, the attack will always grab the channel that can lead to throughput degradation of all the other networked devices.

B. Mathematical Analysis
In the backoff mechanism with a deterministic contention window size (a.k.a., selﬁsh backoff), it is true that

Wi = Cw

(2)

where CWmin = CWmax = Cw. Then, τsb(p) can be deﬁned as the probability that a node transmits in a randomly chosen slot time with selﬁsh backoff depending on collision probability p. Regardless of the backoff stage, any transmission occurs

access, when a selﬁsh device accesses the wireless channel faster than the other devices, its throughput increases whereas the performance of the other devices degrades. Therefore, we mathematically analyzes the performance of the selﬁsh backoff mechanism and the throughput degradation of the other devices. As shown in simulation results, the impacts of selﬁsh backoff are observed. In addition, detection algorithms for classifying malicious attackers via logistic classiﬁcation is proposed.
As a future research direction, we have a plan to numerically estimate the impacts of selﬁsh backoff attacks in micro-grid networks.

which can be derived by [1].

C. Logistic Classiﬁcation
As presented in Fig. 1, we can observe explicit classiﬁcation between normal CSMA/CA behavior and selﬁsh access control. Therefore, we can design classiﬁcation based on this result.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
The corresponding simulations are for observing the impacts of selﬁsh backoff attack with various Cw settings. According to the IEEE 802.15.4 [2], BE is 3, i.e., maximum backoff stage is 7 due to m = 2BE − 1 = 7. In addition, Cw in (2) is 2 [2]. For the selﬁsh backoff attack parameter setting, two possible scenarios are considered where Cw = 1 and Cw = 2.
When Cw = 1, the attacker will access the channel immediately without any backoff waiting, in turn, nearby IEEE 802.15.4 devices cannot have chances to access the channel. In Fig. 1, these three backoff strategies are considered. AS shown Fig. 1, the selﬁsh backoff attacks with various Cw are all independent to the packet collision probability p. In addition, the selﬁsh backoff attack with Cw = 1 can throughput with 1 because it can access the channel immediately.
When Cw = 2, the other nearby neighbor networked devices can access the channel at the ﬁrst slot time (i.e., the case that the device selects the ﬁrst slot with uniform random selection within the given time interval), i.e., then the throughput is less than 1 as also presented in Fig. 1.
