I. INTRODUCTION
Internet of things (IoT) technology is a key component for future smart city and smart home applications. According to the report of international data corportation, the IoT device market will grow to 1,700 billion dollars by 2020, which takes 31.8% of entire IoT market [1]. For future applications, the IoT sensor devices should be able to communicate with very low power because the sensor devices only rely on small batteries.
Ambient backscatter communication (ABC) is an important candidate technology for the low power IoT devices. The ABC transmits binary data within a short range by scattering ambient radio frequency (RF) signals radiated from television (TV) broadcasting towers, Wi-Fi access points, and so on. The binary data ‘0’ and ‘1’ are presented by ‘absorbing’ and ‘reﬂecting’ the ambient RF signals in the ABC transmitter, which is called as the tag [7]. For detection in the receiver, which is called as the reader, there have been several previous studies based on maximum likelihood (ML) in [2]–[4] and energy detection (ED) methods in [5], [6]. Moreover, the authors in [8] and [9] implemented tag and reader modules to show practical feasibility.
Although the ABC has good features as an IoT technology, its coverage and data rate are quite limited [8]. To enhance usability of ABC, it is required to further improve the decoding performance. Most of exisiting studies consider multi–tag and single–reader topologies as in [5]. In this paper, we propose a multi–tag and multi–reader ABC system which improves decoding performance of the reader by exploiting receiver

diversity. The proposed system uses multiple versions of the received signals at the different readers. We also design a simple location based tag–reader paring scheme which provides better decoding performance in realistic network environment. The peformance of the proposed multi tag and multi reader ABC system and the tag–reader paring algorithm is evaluated numerically through simulations. The numerical results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional scheme in [5].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the multi–tag multi–reader system model. In Section III, we propose a decoding scheme using multiple readers according to the distance between tag and reader. The numerical results are presented in Section IV and ﬁnally, conclusive remarks are drawn in Section V.
II. MULTI–TAG MULTI–READER ABC SYSTEM
Fig. 1 shows the system model considered in this paper. The RF source represents a TV tower or a Wi-Fi access point, of which RF signals will be exploited by the ABC system as ambient signals. The ABC system consists of K tags and L readers. We assume that the readers are connected to the central controller. In our scenarios, the readers are data sinks which collect data from the IoT sensor nodes and forward them to a data server. Hence, the assumption that the readers are connected to the central controller can be justiﬁed. The tags send their data using backscattering technique, and the readers receive and forward the signal to the central controller.

The central controller decides ‘0’ or ‘1’ based on the signals

received from the multiple readers. The central controller also

handles the scheduling operation, which selects a single tag out

of multiple tags to send data at certain time. The scheduling

procedure is the same as in [5].

In the system model, hk and hrl denote the channels from the RF source to the tags and to the readers. gk,l represents the channels between the tag k and the reader l. All channels in

Fig. 1 are assumed to be the complex zero-mean Gaussian, i.e.,

that

which can be varied by the distance between the tags and the

readers. We also assume that all channels are independently

distributed.

Fig. 2 shows the transmission protocol which consists of 3

steps: tag selection, threshold selection, and information. The

tag selection is a scheduling procedure where the controller

measures the average power of each tag and selects a single

tag with the best power [5]. In the threshold selection step,

the controller adjusts its decision threshold with which the

controller decides ‘0’ or ‘1’ from the received signals. For

the threshold selection, the selected tag sends the pre-deﬁned

binary patterns and the controller adjusts its threshold which

minimizes bit error rate (BER). In the ﬁnal information step,

the data transmission from the selected tag is performed.

The signal transmitted from the tag k can be written as

L

yr(n) = hrl s(n) + hkgk,lηks(n)B(n) + wr(n),

where s(n) is the signal from the RF source, ηk denotes the attenuation factor of the circuit in the tag, B(n) is the binary signal transmitted from the tag, and wr(n) is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and unit variance. B(n) = 0 when the tag wants to send ‘0’, hence the reader receives the signal from the RF source only. On the other hand, if the tag sends ‘1’, the reader receives the additional reﬂected version of the signal of the RF source. It is worthy to note that the reﬂected RF signal is naturally attenuated in the tag.

III. PROPOSED DECODING SCHEME AND BER PERFORMANCE
In this section, we propose the decoding scheme where the readers cooperatively utilize multiple versions of the received signals at the different readers and simple location based tag– reader paring scheme. Transmission protocol in detail can be referenced in [5].

A. Cooperative Reader Scheme
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the transmission protocol and transmission process, respectively. The transmission process proceeds following 3 steps.
a) Tag selection: In the ﬁrst step, each tag will transmit N0 bits of ‘1’ to reader during Np = (K + 1)N0 symbols. While the k-th tag transmits ‘1’, other (k - 1) tags remain non-backscatter state. The signal transmitted from the tag k can be written as

yr(n) =

hrl s(n) + wr(n), µks(n) + wr(n),

n ∈ [1, N0], n ∈ [kN0 + 1, (k + 1)N0],

where µk = hrl + hkgk,lηk, k ∈ [1, K] and l ∈ [1, L]. The controller will measure the average power φk,l of each tag as

φk,l

=

1 N0

(k+1)N0
|yrl (n)|2.
n=kN0 +1

The controller selects a single tag with the best power as [5]

k∗ = argmax |φk,l − φ0|,
k∈K,l∈L

where φ0 is the ambient RF signal power. b) Threshold selection: In the second step, for the thresh-
old selection, the selected tag transmits a pre-deﬁned test pilot

The controller adjusts its threshold which minimizes BER. Fig. 4 shows the threshold value according to multiple readers and the threshold is decided through simulation.
c) Data transmission: In the ﬁnal step, transmits the data from the selected tag. Then, the controller decides ‘0’ or ‘1’ based on the received signal (1) from the k∗-th tag by using an energy detection method with the threshold value determined in the second step.

B. Location Based Pairing Scheme
The above mentioned cooperative reader scheme can interfere with the received signal with low channel quality. Therefore, we propose a simple location based tag–reader paring scheme.
Transmission process is the same as in cooperative reader scheme in Fig. 3. In the location based pairing scheme, the controller compares the BER value of each reader and multiple readers in the threshold selection step by received test pilot from the k∗-th tag. If there is an extremely good channel gain between the tag and the reader, it is decided as a distributed mode which receives the signal with the best reader. In other

cases, it is determined as a centralized mode which receives the signal with multiple versions.

Receiver Scheme =

PBk,El R < PBcoEmR, PBk,El R ≥ PBcoEmR,

Distributed, C entraliz ed.

C. BER Performance

The result of the decoding is to determine the reliability of the signal with Bˆ(n). Assuming that B(n) = 0 and B(n) = 1 occur at the same probability, the BER can be obtained by

PBER = P r(Bˆ(n) = B(n)) = P r(B(n) = 1)P r(Bˆ(n) = 0|B(n) = 1) + P r(B(n) = 0)P r(Bˆ(n) = 1|B(n) = 0).

IV. NUMERICAL RESULT
In this section, we analyze reliability of received ABC signal according to the number of readers. Fig. 5 shows the BER

424

according to the distance between the tag and the readers using the cooperative reader scheme and Fig. 6 shows the BER according to the distance between the tag and the reader based on the location based pairing scheme. The number of readers is set to 3 and the number of tags is set to 2. The received power of the RF source is ﬁxed as 5dB. The simulation compares ‘Case1’ which is in a state where the tag approaches only reader 1 but reader 2 and reader 3 remain far and ‘Case2’ which is in a state where all tags approach reader 1, 2 and 3.
Case1 : The tag approaches reader 1 but reader 2 and reader 3 remain far away.
Case2 : The tag approaches all readers. Fig. 5 shows that more readers provide better performance of reliability in Case2. However, in Case1, it tends to get better to receive the signal from a single reader. The reason is that if differences in the reliability of the received signal occur, the received signal with high channel gain is destructed by the received signal with low channel gain. Fig. 6 shows the BER performance comparison for Case1 which the tag approaches only reader 1. It is shown that the proposed location based pairing scheme provides better decoding performance depending on distances if differences in the reliability of the received signal exist.

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed a cooperative scheme and a simple location based tag–reader paring scheme to improve decoding performance in ambient backscatter communication networks. Numerical results show that the more the number of readers is the better performance of reception reliability in general situation, but when there is an extremely close to the tag, there is a difference in the reliability of the received signal. Therefore, if a tag with extremly dominant channel gain exists, a method of receiving from a single reader is optimal.
For further work, there will be the tag signal detection that removes the inﬂuence of interference in a unknown channel environment
