Abstract— In order to perform smooth and coordinated flights in multi-UAV systems, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) need to know each other's location information. Multi-token circulation method allows UAVs to learn each other's location information in the Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) quickly and this information can be updated continuously. In the multi-token circulation method, it is very important to determine how many tokens are used and how these tokens circulate in the FANET depending on the number and deployment of the UAVs. In this paper, we developed a master UAV method to determine number of tokens and circulation of these tokens.
Keywords— unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); multi UAV systems; flying ad hoc networks (FANET); multi-token circulation; location information sharing; vehicle routing problem (VRP).
I. INTRODUCTION
Autonomous vehicles are defined as self-acting vehicles without the need for a driver [1]. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is a widely used type of autonomous vehicles. [2]. In recent years with advances in UAV technologies, multiUAV systems in other words UAV swarms that consist of a large number of UAVs has become increasingly widespread and the use of these systems is increasing day by day [3]. With this prevalence, the concept of multi-UAV is becoming a more popular research topic [4]. Many military and civilian tasks can be carried out in a much shorter time with much higher performance without risking human life by the multiUAV systems [5]. These mentioned benefits play a leading role in the widespread use of UAVs. Thanks to the wide spread of UAV swarms, tasks such as target search [6], monitoring and viewing of a region [7], delivering aid to a region, and post-disaster planning [8] can be completed in a shorter time with high performance.
Although there are many advantages of using multi-UAV systems, it is becoming increasingly complicated to provide coordination of UAVs within the swarm. There is a need for a robust system to ensure the coordination of multi-UAV systems to provide efficient and smooth communication between UAVs.

Even though infrastructure based approach is a widely used method in communication between UAVs, it has led to the search for alternative solutions due to the limited communication range and the fact that infrastructure cannot be provided in all cases [9]. The concept of flying ad hoc network (FANET) provides an important solution in the enabling of communication in multi-UAV systems without the need for an infrastructure [10]. The second step that should be taken after the communication is provided with the FANET structure in order to carry out coordinated flights in multi-UAV systems is to ensure that the UAVs need each other's rapidly changing location information to make coordinated and trouble-free flights.
A multi-token based method that tokens holding location information of the UAVs in the multi-UAV systems has created a structure to enable UAVs to know each other's position with the least error. The coordinates information of all UAVs are kept in the tokens. The tokens move between the UAVs depending on the communication range, and by comparing the information they hold during the roaming and the information in the UAVs' memory, they update both their own information and the information that the UAVs hold. With the increase of the number of UAVs, the number of UAVs to be visited and the size of the coordinate information to be kept in the tokens increase. Because of this condition, the tokens circulation times are extended. In order to avoid this situation, the number of tokens in circulation has been increased. In the studies conducted with multitoken circulation method, it has been tried to show the effectiveness of the method by trying a different number of tokens with different numbers of UAVs [3, 11, 12]. At this point, according to the structure of the multi-UAV system, there is a need for a model to determine the number of tokens and how they circulate to collision.
As an indispensable mission assignment for UAVs there is an increasing attention on researching the path between the UAVs. To determine the number of UAVs in the network, what is the best route for every UAV in order to minimize the travel distance, how long will it take to accomplish the task are common problems that are studied in the literature [13-16]. To solve the multi-token circulation in multi-UAV

systems we propose the vehicle routing problem (VRP) which is known as an operational research problem. The token is considered as a vehicle with the mission to visit all UAVs. In this paper, we developed a mathematical model to determine number of tokens to provide sharing of location information between the UAVs. Simultaneously, the route for each token is determined with the proposed model. Total distance travelled and time used for the circulation is determined. The problem is modeled as a mixed integer linear program and optimal solutions are obtained. Using the proposed model a set of test instances are illustrated. The experiments show that the instances can be optimized for 5 UAVs with 1 token, for 10 and 15 UAVs 2 tokens, and for 20 and 25 UAVs 3 tokens are needed.
In the developed algorithm, the substitute master UAV structure has been added to the algorithm to ensure that the multi-UAV system continues to operate smoothly. Thus, with the dynamically changing master-substitute master structure, the continuity of the autonomous structure provided to the multi-UAV system has been ensured.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, multi-token circulation with master UAV method is defined and proposed mixed integer programming model is presented. Experimental study of the proposed model is stated in Section 3 and Section 4 concludes the paper.
II. MULTI-TOKEN CIRCULATION WITH MASTER UAV METHOD
The UAVs in FANET, which have the ability to move quickly, need a structure to keep each other's constantly changing position information up to date. In the token based approach, the location information of the UAVs is kept in the token and the token constantly visits all UAVs to update the location information of both its own memory and the UAVs. In this way, it is ensured that UAVs in the multi-UAV system are able to learn each other's constantly changing position information quickly [11, 12]. With the increase of the number of UAVs, the size of the position information to be carried by the token and the number of UAVs that the token should visit also increase. Due to this reason, token circulation time in FANET is extended. Extension of the circulation time delays the UAVs learning the current position information of each other. In order to avoid this situation, multi-token circulation based system is recommended in the studies [3, 11, 12]. In these systems, the number of tokens in circulation is increased with the increasing number of UAVs. With the increase in the number of tokens, the UAVs are provided to learn each other's location information quickly.
However, when more than one token is in circulation in FANET, the probability of collisions of the tokens is a problem to be solved. The allocation of a separate communication channel for each token prevents the token collisions, but is an inefficient, cost-effective method [3, 11]. In the two-channel token circulation model, there are two communication channels independent of the number of token and in one of these channels the tokens are circulated and the other channel transmits routing packets that allow tokens to avoid collisions [12, 17]. The two-channel model prevents

token collisions. In the studies where this model is proposed, the results of different number of tokens for different numbers of UAVs have been tested [12, 17].
In this study, the proposed master UAV method decides how many tokens in the FANET circulate and the route in which the tokens move, depending on the number of UAVs and the deployment of UAVs. Thus, the token number and circulation are optimized by master UAV and an autonomous structure is provided for the multi-UAV systems.
Information about the structure and the content of the tokens is shown in Fig. 1. There are four different fields in the token format, including the token ID, the token’s roaming route, the substitute master UAV list and the coordinate information of the all UAVs. Since there may be more than one token circulating in the FANET, there is a unique token number in the first field of the token that allows the tokens to be separated from each other. In the second field, there is information indicating the route of the token’s circulation. With this information, the token knows which UAVs will be visited by which order. In the third area, if the master UAV is not accessible or the master UAV is disabled, a list of the substitute master UAVs that can be master UAVs is kept. This list is also kept in a priority order of the master UAV candidates. The last field includes the coordinate information of all UAVs and the counter variable to be used to compare the up to dateness of the coordinate information.
Fig. 1. Token format
Once the token format to be used for the UAVs to learn each other's location information has been determined, in the second phase should designate how these tokens circulate in the FANET. In order to ensure non-collision token circulation within the FANET, the most appropriate number of token and the path to be followed by the tokens are performed autonomously by the master UAV method. Traveling salesman problem (TSP) is represented as a graph where the locations and the routes between the locations are represented with nodes and edges, respectively. The distance between the nodes is represented as the weight of each edge. Thus, the aim is to determine shortest sum of the weights that is the route between the locations. A generalization form of

TSP is the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) where the aim is to determine the optimal set of routes for vehicles delivering goods or services to various locations from a single place of origin, a depot [18]. Therefore, the token in the network are represented as vehicle, the UAVs are used as locations to be visited by the token, and the depot is represented as Master UAV in the network. As, TSP is an NP-hard problem [19], multi-token circulation in multi-UAV systems for location information sharing is a combinatorial optimization problem. How the UAVs keep the location information of other UAVs up to date through to the tokens circulating in the FANET is shown in the pseudo code in Fig. 2. The information update process repeats for each token as much as the number of tokens determined by the Master UAV. The UAV that receives the token compares the information in the token and in its own memory and updates the information in both its own memory and the token. The other neighbors of the source UAV who overhear the token because they are within the communication range, can update the information in their own memory even if they cannot update the token. The update process is provided by the counter variable included with the location information. The counter variable is incremented at every unit time so that the position information with the highest counter value is the most up to date information.

A. Proposed Mixed Integer Programming Model In order to collect location information from the UAVs
and share the data immediately to the rest of the UAVs is an important purpose in the multi-UAV systems.
Let G  V , Ebe an undirected and connected graph
where V is the set of identical UAVs and E is the set of edges between nodes that is the set of token connection
between each pair of UAVs. The coordinates  xi , yi  of the
UAVs are randomly placed. Location of the UAVs and master UAV is also known a priori. Master UAV is determined according to the most neighboring UAV in the network.
Connectivity assumption for the multi-UAV Systems is based on the Euclidean distance between UAVs, denoted as

dij as represented in (1) where i, j  I . If distance between
UAV connections is less than the communication range, then the connection between UAVs may be considered as possible connection.

dij  (x j  xi )2  ( y j  yi )2

Test instances are generated in Section III and the parameters of the problem are listed in Table 1. Since, the terrain dimensions are used as 2200 m x 2200 m, the communication range differs according to the number of UAVs in the terrain dimensions. Due to the transmission time is much longer than the processing time, the processing time is negligible when taken together with the transmission time [20]. For this reason, it is aimed to minimize the token circulation time with the algorithm developed in the study.

with CPLEX solver [21] is used and the runs are executed on a 4.20 GHz Intel Core i7 computer with 32 GB of RAM.
In Fig. 3 the performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is presented. The UAVs in FANET are deployed in the terrain, according to the highest number of neighborhoods for the grid topology sequence. In accordance with the output results, for the deployment of 5 UAVs there is 1 token used with the 400 m communication range to share the location information. When the UAV number is increased to 10, the required number of tokens are increased to 2. As the UAV obtain the information via token, the information is compared and its memory is updated unless it is the same with the token information. If there is only one token, the information update time will be extended as the number of the UAVs are increased in the terrain dimension. Moreover, the UAVs may lose communication because they may lose each other due to the single token circulation in the system. For 15, 20, and 25 number of UAVs in the network there are 3 tokens needed to obtain adequate location information to optimize the multi-token circulation with Master UAV Method in multi-UAV systems. The performance of the developed algorithm has been implemented on different UAV numbers to show that the algorithm can be applied for multi-UAV systems with a different number of UAVs.

It is obvious that not only the communication range but also the number of UAVs are critical parameters to solve the problem. With the developed master UAV method, UAVs are able to update each other's location information as soon as possible. In addition, the tokens’ routes are determined by the master UAV allow the tokens to circulate without collision.
IV. CONCLUSION In this study, with the proposed master UAV method we have stated the necessary number of tokens in the FANET to share the location information between the UAVs. With the proposed master UAV approach, different deployment scenarios are generated and the results are satisfactory. Simultaneously, the related route for each token is determined according to the number of master UAVs and the deployment of UAVs in the network. The number of tokens and circulation in the network are optimized by master UAV and an autonomous structure is provided for the multi-UAV systems. The ability of the tokens to perform their circulation without collision also enabled all UAVs to quickly update the location information of other UAVs. The obtained results indicate the effectiveness of the master UAV method for location information sharing of UAVs in the multi-UAV systems.

As a future study, we are planning to extend our model as including the third dimension for the deployment of UAVs that is one of the key challenges to obtain communication between UAVS. Then, it is aimed to apply the method developed in this study to larger multi-UAV systems. Moreover, it is planned that the UAVs carry the image data as a load and the load is collected in the most optimized way in a center by the master UAV method.
