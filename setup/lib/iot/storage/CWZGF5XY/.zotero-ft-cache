vProbe Solution Brief

The Challenge
If the future of mobile network operators (MNOs) could be summed up in one word, it would be this: More. More traffic. More devices. More competition. To meet the demands of more, MNOs need less complexity and cost in their networks, fueling the migration to network virtualization. As the mobile industry moves to network functions virtualization (NFV) and a virtualized Evolved Packet Core (vEPC), traditional network measurement and monitoring tools are left behind. Virtualized elements are dynamic in nature and require network probes that can be added, moved and deleted in an equally dynamic fashion, creating the need for a virtual probe.

“Virtualization of the network and cloud-based services will render physical passive probe technology obsolete.”
- Patrick Kelly, Founder, Appledore Research Group

The Native Solution: Affirmed Active Intelligent vProbe
Affirmed vProbe is the industry’s first native virtual probe, co-located with the Affirmed’s Mobile Content Cloud vEPC and WiFi Solutions rather than delivered as a separate network appliance. With the vProbe, MNOs can dramatically reduce hardware costs, network complexity and the performance issues typically associated with probe solutions while providing real-time network intelligence.

»» Network Efficiency Co-locating the vProbe with the vEPC and WiFi solutions reduces network hardware requirements and eliminates the need to duplicate network functions such as user/control plane packet correlation and deep packet inspection (DPI). As a result, performance impacts on the network are minimized and total cost of ownership is lowered by 50% or more.

data record sets. Operators can use these

data records to identify target areas in the network that require packet mirroring for a deeper analysis. This

means that only a subset of traffic data needs to be mirrored—a significant upgrade from the “mirror first, ask

questions later” approach that other probe solutions take and which can add sizable cost and complexity to

the network.

»» Data Flexibility Current network probe solutions in the market provide restricted access to rich signaling and data plane session information. Affirmed vProbe provides open access to session information using Google’s standards-based Protobuf to create data records. These can easily be integrated with a variety of third-party analytics tools to deliver real-time insight into network operations, network security, network planning, marketing activities and more. vProbe is currently available as a pre-validated solution with EMC’s Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) analytics platform.
