Abstract—In this paper, a ﬁxed rate splitting (FRS) scheme and an adaptive rate splitting (ARS) scheme are proposed for an uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, in which a near user and a far user communicate with a basestation (BS) using power-domain NOMA. Considering back-off power control, information signal of near user is split into two data streams for uplink transmissions, whereas information signal of far user is transmitted without rate splitting. In the FRS scheme, a ﬁxed power allocation factor is applied at near user for allocating transmit power between data streams. At the BS receiver, successive interference cancellation is applied for recovering all data streams. Motivated by cognitive radio principles, a dynamic power allocation factor is designed for the ARS scheme based on instantaneous channel state information. Closed-form expressions are derived for outage probabilities of the near and far users, respectively. In addition, analytical expressions are derived for asymptotic outage probabilities of the FRS and ARS schemes, respectively. The superior outage performance achieved by the FRS and ARS schemes are corroborated by system-level simulation results.

I. INTRODUCTION
Being capable of providing spectral-efﬁcient massive connectivity, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered as a paradigm shift in multiple access for ﬁfth generation (5G) networks and beyond [1]. With the aid of power-domain superposition coding and successive interference cancellation (SIC), multiple users are served in the same orthogonal resource block along the time, frequency, and/or code axes in power-domain NOMA systems. Under various channel topologies, information theoretic analyses of powerdomain NOMA have been widely studied such as those for multiple access channels (MACs) [2], broadcast channels (BCs) [3], interference channels (ICs) [4], and unicast/multicast channels [5], [6]. When channels of far and near users are well separated, it has been shown that power-domain NOMA can achieve superior system performance over that of orthogonal multiple access (OMA) at the cost of that partial users are required to fully decode and cancel interference from other users.
Regarding the capability of delivering different types of service messages to multiple users, rate splitting (RS) techniques have gained a lot of attention recently. In particular, an RS transmitter splits individual information into common and private messages, so that common messages can be decoded by all the receivers. In [7] and [8], it has been shown that RS can

achieve the allowed largest rate-region for a two-user IC. Then, the authors of [9] applied RS for a multi-cell network attaining a signiﬁcant improvement on the achievable rate. Recently, the RS-aided multiple access techniques have been shown for bridging between NOMA and space-division multiple access (SDMA) in the non-orthogonal unicast and multicast channels [5], [6]. Different from the above RS techniques, another RS technique has been applied for avoiding the complicated users grouping in uplink NOMA systems, in which each user’s signal was divided into two parts to generate two virtual users, respectively [10].
For uplink NOMA systems, RS is difﬁcult to be implemented due to the complicated power allocation with respect to both the power-domain superposition coding and RS. Also, the performance analysis of RS in uplink NOMA systems is difﬁcult to be conducted due to the complicated system setting. In this paper, we propose a ﬁxed rate splitting (FRS) scheme and an adaptive rate splitting (ARS) scheme for an uplink NOMA system under the back-off power control [11]. With the aid of the back-off power control, the power allocation is performed between the split data streams, so that it can be optimized for decreasing outage probability.
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
• An FRS scheme is proposed for the uplink NOMA system under the back-off power control. With the ﬁxed power allocation between the split data streams of the near user, the FRS scheme can achieve an improved outage performance over that of conventional NOMA under the back-off power control.
• An ARS scheme is proposed to achieve the allowed minimum outage probability. Regarding the virtual and real users as the primary, secondary, and tertiary users according to their detecting order in the SIC, the dynamic power allocation is implemented in a cognitive way for the data streams, which signiﬁcantly improves the outage performance of the considered system.
• For both the FRS and ARS schemes, closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probabilities of the near and far users, respectively. Asymptotic outage probability ﬂoors are also derived for all the considered schemes. The superior outage performance achieved by the FRS and ARS schemes is veriﬁed by system-level simulation results.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the system model of the uplink NOMA system under the back-off power control; Section III presents the FRS scheme and provides the corresponding outage performance analysis. Section IV proposes the ARS scheme and presents the corresponding outage performance analysis; Section V presents the simulation results and veriﬁes the enhanced outage performance achieved by the proposed schemes. Section VI summarizes this work.

II. NOMA UNDER BACK-OFF POWER CONTROL

We consider an uplink NOMA system consisting of a base

station (BS) and a pair of users, U1 and U2. Without loss of

generality, we assume that U1 and U2 are the near and far

users, respectively. The channel from Ui (i = 1 or 2) to the

BS is denoted by hi, which is modeled as independent but not

identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) Rayleigh fading. In addition, a

path-loss component Li is associated with hi for representing

the large-scale fading. The information signal of Ui is denoted

by xi, which follows independent and identically distributed

(i.i.d.) complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit

variance.

In each block of transmissions, U1 and U2 transmit their

information signals to the BS simultaneously. At the BS, the

received signal can be expressed as:

√

√

y = P1L1h1x1 + P2L2h2x2 + n,

(1)

where Pi is the transmit power of Ui and n is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the BS receiver with zero mean and variance σ2. The BS receiver ﬁrst detects the near user’s signal by treating the far user’s signal as noise. Then, the BS receiver applies SIC for detecting the far user’s signal. Based on (1), the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting x1 and x2 can be derived as:

γ1

=

P1L1|h1|2 P2L2|h2|2 + σ2

(2)

and

γ2

=

P2

L2|h2|2 σ2

,

(3)

respectively. To ensure the diverse power levels of the arrived signals required by the SIC processing, we adopt the back-off power control of [11], i.e., the transmit power of Ui is given by

Pi = Pt − (i − 1)ε˜ − 10 log10(Li),

(4)

where Pt is the target arrived power of the received signal at

the BS and ε˜ is the power step level (ε˜ ≥ 0 dB). Accordingly,

we have a linear relationship P2L2 = εP1L1 with ε

10−

ε˜ 10

satisfying 0 < ε ≤ 1. Substituting P2L2 = εP1L1 into (2)

and (3), the received SINR and SNR for detecting x1 and x2

can be rewritten as:

γ1

=

ρ|h1|2 ερ|h2|2 +

1

(5)

and

γ2 = ερ|h2|2,

(6)

respectively, where ρ P1L1/σ2.

A. Outage Probability Analysis

In this part, the outage probabilities of U1 and U2 achieved
by the uplink NOMA under the back-off power control are
analyzed, respectively. For the user Ui, we denote its targeted transmit rate by R�i with i = 1 and 2. Then, the required SINR/SNR threshold for the successful achieving R�i can be expressed as γ�i = 2Ri − 1.
Since the random variable (RV) gi ρ|hi|2 follows an
exponential distribution with the scale parameter of ρλi, where λi E{|hi|2}, the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of gi can be respectively
expressed as:

=

and

Fgi (x)

(7)

For the detection of x1, an outage event occurs if γ1 < γ�1.
For the detection of x2, the outage events include two cases: 1) γ1 < γ�1; 2) (γ1 ≥ γ�1) ∩ (γ2 < γ�2).

Pr{γ1 < γ�1} + Pr{(γ1 ≥ γ�1) ∩ (γ2 < γ�2)} can be easily

evaluated as (8) and (9), respectively.

III. FRS SCHEME

For the uplink NOMA system consisting of two users, we

only consider the RS at a single user [12]. Speciﬁcally, the

RS is applied at the near user in the FRS scheme. Taking into

account the back-off power control, a ﬁxed power allocation

factor is employed for allocating the transmit power between

two data streams of the near user.

For the near user, its information signal x1 is split into the

data streams x11 and x12, respectively, which correspond to

two virtual users U11 and U12, respectively. Accordingly, the

received signal at the BS can be written as:

√

√

√

y = αP¯1h1x11 + (1 − α)P¯1h1x12 + P¯2h2x2 + n, (11)

159

where α is the power allocation factor. Considering the three users, U11, U12, and U2, the detecting orders at the BS can be classiﬁed into several kinds [10]. For simplicity, we only consider one kind of the detecting order, i.e., x11 → x2 → x12. Based on (11), the received SINR for detecting x11 can be derived as

γ11

=

(1 −

αρ|h1|2 α)ρ|h1|2 + ερ|h2|2

. +1

(12)

After recovering x11 and subtracting the corresponding recon-

structed signal from (11), the remaind signal for detecting x2

can be generated as:

√

√

y = P¯2h2x2 + (1 − α)P¯1h1x12 + n.

(13)

Thus, the received SINR for detecting x2 can be derived as:

γ2

=

(1

−

ερ|h2|2 α)ρ|h1|2

+

. 1

(14)

With the aid of the SIC processing, the remained signal for

detecting x12 is given by √

y = (1 − α)P¯1h1x12 + n.

(15)

and the received SNR for detecting x12 can be derived as:

γ12 = (1 − α)ρ|h1|2.

(16)

A. Outage Probability Analysis
In this section, the outage probabilities of U1 and U2 achieved by the FRS scheme are analyzed, respectively. For the virtual users U11 and U12, we denote the corresponding target rates by R�11 and R�12, respectively. Then, the required SINR/SNR threshold for the successful achieving R�j can be expressed as γ�j = 2Rj − 1 with j ∈ {11, 12}. Moreover, we have R�11 = βR�1 and R�12 = (1 − β)R�1, where 0 < β < 1 is the target RS factor.
When the detecting order x11 → x2 → x12 is applied, the outage events of U1 can be classiﬁed into three cases: 1) γ11 < γ�11; 2) (γ11 ≥ γ�11)∩(γ2 < γ�2); 3) (γ11 ≥ γ�11)∩(γ2 ≥ γ�2) ∩ (γ12 < γ�21). Accordingly, the outage probability of U1 can be expressed as:

Pout,1 = Pr{γ11 < γ�11} + Pr{(γ11 ≥ γ�11) ∩ (γ2 < γ�2)} + Pr{(γ11 ≥ γ�11)∩(γ2 ≥ γ�2)∩(γ12 < γ�21)}. (17)

As such, the outage probability of U2 can be written as:

Pout,2 = Pr{γ11 < γ�11}+Pr{(γ11 ≥ γ�11)∩(γ2 < γ�2)}. (18)

Proof: See Appendix A. The above results characterize the outage performance of U1 and U2 in terms of the transmit SNR, power allocation factor, and target RS rates, which can be easily evaluated by computer computation. Besides, it is shown that the outage probabilities of U1 and U2 are correlated with each other via the target rates R�1 and R�2, respectively.

IV. ARS SCHEME

Motivated by the fact that NOMA can be treated as a special

case of cognitive radio systems [13], we propose the ARS

scheme in this section.

When the detecting order x11 → x2 → x12 is applied at

the BS for the SIC processing, U11, U2, and U12 are treated

as the primary, secondary, and tertiary users, respectively.

Obviously, an unsuccessful detection of x12 or x2 results in

an incorrect detecting of x12, which in turn results in an

outage transmission of x1 for U1. In addition, an unsuccessful

detection of x11 results in an outage transmission of x2 for U2.

In the ARS scheme, the power allocation factor is designed

with the priority for satisfying the quality of service (QoS)

requirements of U11, U2, and U12 sequentially.
For the successful detecting of x11, the QoS requirement γ11 ≥ γ�11 can be rewritten as:

α ∈ [α�, 1],

subject to

γ�11

≤

g1 , + εg2

(22)

where

(

α�

is the minimum value of α satisfying γ11 ≥ γ�11 and the

constraint γ�11 the successful

≤

g1 1+εg2

is

applied

to

restrict

0 < α�1

detecting of x2, the QoS requirement

≤ 1. For γ2 ≥ γ�2

can be rewritten as:

α ∈ [α�, 1], subject to γ�2 ≤ εg2,

(24)

where

is the minimum value of α satisfying γ2 ≥ γ�2 and the constraint γ�2 ≤ εg2 is applied to restrict α� ≤ 1. Then, the power allocation factor satisfying both γ11 ≥ γ�11 and γ2 ≥ γ�2
is constrained by

{ [max(α�, α�), 1],
α∈

γ�11 ≤

g1 1+εg2

and γ�2 ≤ εg2,

does not exist,

otherwise.

(26)

Corresponding to the detection of x12, to achieve a probability Pr{γ12 ≥ γ�12} as large as possible considering that γ12 decreases monotonically with increasing α, the power
allocation factor needs to be minimized besides the constraint

(26). Therefore, the power allocation factor of the ARS scheme

is given by

{ α = max(α�, α�),

γ�11 ≤

g1 1+εg2

and

γ�2 ≤ εg2,

does not exist,

otherwise.

Based on (27), a non-outage event of detecting x1 occurs

if α exists and the corresponding γ12 is required to satisfy γ12(α) ≥ γ�12, where γ12(α) is a function of α given by (16).

Since there are two possible values for a feasible α according

to (27), the outage probability of U1 can be expressed as:

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we present system level simulation results to verify the superior outage performance achieved by the FRS and ARS schemes, respectively. In the system-level simulation [14], we assume the distances from the BS to the near and far users are 50 meters and 100 meters, respectively, and set the large-scale fading Li as that of [11]. In addition, the target arrived SNR is deﬁned as ρt = Pt/σ2.
The outage probability versus target arrived SNR is investigated in Fig. 1, in which we set R�1 = 1.5 bps/Hz, R�2 = 0.5 bps/Hz, ε˜ = 5 dB, and β = 0.01. In addition, we set α = 0.9 for the FRS scheme. The results in Fig. 1 show that both the FRS and ARS schemes decrease the outage probabilities for U1 and U2, respectively, as ρt increases. Although the FRS and ARS schemes achieve the higher outage probabilities for U1 in the low and middle SNR regions than that of the back-off power control-aided NOMA without employing RS (denoted as “NOMA” in Fig. 2), the proposed two RS schemes achieve the smaller outage probabilities in the high SNR region. For U2, both the FRS and ARS schemes achieve the smaller outage probabilities than those of “NOMA” in the considered whole SNR region. In addition, the ARS scheme achieves the smaller outage probabilities than those of the FRS scheme in the considered whole SNR region. The results in Fig. 1 also

and U2 achieved by the FRS scheme are larger than those of “NOMA”. As β increases, the outage probabilities of U1 and U2 achieved by the ARS scheme also increase and this tendency also occurs for the outage probability of U2 achieved by the FRS scheme. However, the outage probability of U1 achieved by the FRS scheme ﬁrst decreases with increasing β and then increases with increasing β after β surpasses a threshold value.
In Fig. 4, we investigate the impact of the power allocation factor on the outage performance of the FRS scheme along with outage performance comparison for all the considered schemes. In Fig. 4, we set R�1 = 1.5 bps/Hz, R�2 = 0.5 bps/Hz, β = 0.1, ε˜ = 5 dB, and ρt = 30 dB. The results in Fig. 4 show that the power allocation factor has different effects on the outage probabilities of U1 and U2 when the FRS scheme is applied. For U1, the outage probability ﬁrst decreases with increasing α; then, the outage probability increases with increasing α after α approaches a threshold value. For U2, the outage probability always decreases with increasing α. For the FRS scheme, the outage probabilities of U1 and U2 are smaller than those of “NOMA” in the large α region, which suggests that α should be set with a large value for the FRS scheme. Moreover, the ARS scheme achieves the smallest outage probabilities for both U1 and U2 among all the schemes.

verify the correctness of the derived analytical results. In the high SNR region, the outage probabilities of both two users approach the same ﬂoor as predicted by the analytical results. Moreover, the ARS scheme achieves the smallest ﬂoor for the outage probabilities among all the considered schemes.
In Fig. 2, we investigate the impact of the target rates on the outage probability, where we set ρt = 20 dB, β = 0.01, ε˜ = 5 dB, and a ﬁxed R�2 = 0.2 bps/Hz. As it is shown in Fig. 2, the FRS and ARS schemes achieve the smaller outage probabilities than those of “NOMA” in the considered whole R�1 region. Among all the schemes, the ARS scheme achieves the smallest outage probabilities for both U1 and U2 in the considered whole R�1 region. As R�1 increases, the outage probabilities achieved by the ARS scheme also increase for U1 and U2, respectively. In contrary, the outage probabilities achieved by “NOMA” keep almost the same as R�1 increases.
The impact of the target RS factor β on the outage probability is investigated in Fig. 3, where we set ρt = 20 dB, R�1 = 1.5 bps/Hz, R�2 = 0.5 bps/Hz, and ε˜ = 5 dB. For the FRS scheme, we set α = 0.9. The results in Fig. 3 show that the ARS scheme achieves the smallest outage probabilities for U1 and U2, respectively, in the considered whole β region. For the FRS scheme, the outage probabilities of U1 and U2 are smaller than those of “NOMA” in the small and middle β regions. However, in the large β region, the outage probabilities of U1

For detecting x1, a non-outage event occurs only when γ11 ≥ γ�11, γ2 ≥ γ�2, and γ12 ≥ γ�12 happen simultaneously, i.e., x11, x2, and x12 are correctly detected. Let I1 Pr{(γ11 ≥ γ�11) ∩ (γ2 ≥ γ�2) ∩ (γ12 ≥ γ�12)}, the outage probability in (17) can be rewritten as: Pout,1 = 1 − I1. After some mathematical manipulation, the term I1 can be rewritten

I2 = Pr (g1 ≥ τ3) ∩

(

γ2 +(1−α)γ2 g1 ε

which has a similar form as that of I1 in (33). As such, the outage probability Pout,2 can be derived as (20).

APPENDIX B: A PROOF OF THEOREM 3

Let I3 ( γ12(α�) ≥

εg2) ∩ α� < α� ∩ γ12(α�) ≥ γ�12 , the outage probability of

U1 in (28) can be rewritten as Pout,1 = 1 − (I3 + I4).

After some mathematical manipulation, the term I3 can be expressed as:

{(

As such, the term I4 can be expressed as:

Then,

Substituting (38) into Pout,1 = 1 − (I3 + I4), we arrive at (30).
