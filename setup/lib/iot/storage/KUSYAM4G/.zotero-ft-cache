Search Tips Edit Structured Search

Booleans:
Boolean operators must be in capitals: e.g. `robot AND engine`, or `car OR boat`. && is an alias for AND and || is an alias for OR. Parentheses can be used to group search terms. e.g. `(wheat AND grain) OR (sorgum AND barley)`

Fields:
Search a specific field in the index (or fields) use `field:term`: e.g. ` title: (leishmani* AND diagnos*) || abstract: (leishmani* AND diagnos*) && classification_cpc: (A61K* OR C12N*) Note: Fields are case sensitive

Wildcards: e.g. * , ?, ~2 and regular expressions like /ar[gb]on/

Language:
To search in a language other than English, use the "Query Tools" section at the bottom of the sidebar filters.

Abstract

The invention relates to a heterogeneous wireless network access selection method based on users. According to different service flow communication requirements of the users, network, terminal and user parameters are extracted, parameter key factors are quantized based on a fuzzy function, parameters are compared through an analytic hierarchy process, and the weights of the key factors are obtained; then according to an ordinal number preference algorithm similar to an ideal scheme, the close degree value of alternative network parameters is obtained by combining the parameter quantized value with the weights; network access is selected according to the close degree value. Network received signal intensity is sampled and pre-estimated, and calling drop caused by attenuation of received signal intensity of a selected access network is reduced. Through an improved fuzzy decision quantitative method, algorithm complexity caused by building of a fuzzy rule base is avoided, and calculation complexity is lowered. Optimal network access can be selected according to service types of the users, network congestion is reduced, and network resources are fully utilized.
