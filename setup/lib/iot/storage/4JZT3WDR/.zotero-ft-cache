Abstract—In this paper, we propose an artiﬁcial noise-aided tag scheduling (ANTS) scheme in order to enhance physical layer security in ambient backscatter communications (ABCs), which utilize existing radio frequency (RF) signals such as TV, FM radio, Wi-Fi, and so on. In more detail, we ﬁrst select the best tag based on the channel gain between a tag and a reader and then select another tag for generating artiﬁcial noise affecting an eavesdropper. Consequently, we propose a scheduling criterion to choose both information and artiﬁcial noise tags. In addition, we apply a successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique at the reader in order to eliminate the interference from the artiﬁcial noise tag. The simulation results show that our proposed ANTS scheme can obtain a better secrecy rate as the channel gain between the tag and the receiver increases and the number of tags increases. Moreover, when the number of tags is sufﬁciently large, the proposed ANTS scheme signiﬁcantly outperforms the conventional scheme in terms of average secrecy rate.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, as Internet of things (IoT) has a great attention, many researchers have been studying on the problems of power supply and radio resource scarcity to accommodate a number of IoT devices. Among a lot of research topics, ambient backscatter communication (ABC), which enables to utilize existing RF signals, such as TV, FM radio, Wi-Fi, and so on, is emerged as one of promising technologies [1], [2].
In ABC systems, the tags can transmit their own signals utilizing ambient RF signals by adjusting the impedance values of RF antennas. That is, a tag can transmit ‘1’ or ‘0’ bit information by setting reﬂecting or absorbing mode on its antenna. In reﬂecting mode, the tag maximally reﬂects the ambient RF signals and thus, it is detected as a high level signal at the reader and regarded as ‘1’ bit. On the contrary, in absorbing mode, the tag absorbs the ambient RF signals as much as possible so that the signal level is low and considered as ‘0’ bit at the reader. Such far, there have been many studies on the ABS systems with a variety of ambient RF signals such as FM radio [3], Wi-Fi [4], and OFDM signals [5].
On the other hand, physical layer security, which fundamentally enhances wireless communication security at physical layer, is also taken into account as one of attractive technologies [7]. Many researchers have studied a lot of physical layer security issues in order to secure the information transmission

over various wireless channels. In recent research, an artiﬁcial noise generation scheme for enhancing the security at the physical layer was proposed [8], [9]. Additionally, a protocol, which enhances the security at physical layer by scheduling a tag with the best channel gain between the tag and the reader, was proposed in an ABC environment [10].
In this paper, we propose an artiﬁcial noise-aided tag scheduling (ANTS) scheme in an ABC system which consists of K tags, a reader, and an eavesdropper. In this scheme, we select a tag for message transmission and another tag for artiﬁcial noise generation at the same time. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channel, when messages are received at the reader, it is also delivered to the eavesdropper. After all, the proposed ANTS scheme can enhance the secrecy rate by enhancing the channel capacity at the reader and reducing the channel capacity at the eavesdropper.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system model is presented. The proposed artiﬁcial noiseaided tag scheduling scheme is presented in Section III. In Section IV, numerical results are discussed. Finally, conclusive remarks are drawn in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL

respectively, and then transmits the modulated data to the

reader. At this time, the backscattered signals can be received

not only at the reader but also at the eavesdropper due to the

broadcast nature of wireless communication channel.

We assume block fading channels between a tag and the RF

source, the reader, gk ∼ CN (0, σg2),

and the and fk

eavesdropper, , ∼ CN (0, σf2

i.e., hk ) for k

∼ CN (0, σh2), ∈ {1, ..., K}

where σx2, can be regarded as the distance from the tag to the

RF source, the reader, and the eavesdropper, respectively. In

addition, the channels from the RF source to the reader and

the eavesdropper are assumed as rayleigh fading channels with

unit variance, i.e., hr ∼ CN (0, 1) and he ∼ CN (0, 1). Then,

the received signals at the reader and the eavesdropper are

expressed, respectively, as

K
yr(n) = hrs(n) + hkgkηks(n)Bk(n) + ωr(n), (1)
k=1 K
ye(n) = hes(n) + hkfkηks(n)Bk(n) + ωe(n), (2)
k=1

where s(n) denotes the complex baseband equivalent signal transmitted by the RF source, Bk(n) denotes the binary signal modulated by the impedance switching of the k-th tag, and ηk is the backscatter efﬁciency factor of the tag. ωr and ωe represent the additive white Gaussian noises (AWGNs) with zero mean and unit variance, i.e., ωr ∼ CN (0, 1) and ωe ∼ CN (0, 1).

III. PROPOSED ARTIFICIAL NOISE-AIDED TAG SCHEDULING
In this section, we propose an artiﬁcial noise aided tag scheduling (ANTS) scheme to enhance the performance in terms of secrecy rate. The frame structure for the proposed ANTS scheme is shown in Fig. 2.

A. At Reader
1) First subslot: The k-th tag transmits No bits to the reader during the symbol duration from (k − 1)No to kNo and the

other (K − 1) tags are silent as a non-backscatter mode. Therefore, the received signal at the reader is expressed as

yr(n) =

hrs(n) + ωr(n),

Bk(n) = 0,

hrs(n) + hkgkηks(n) + ωr(n), Bk(n) = 1.

(3)

Next, the reader calculates the average power as

Φk

=

1 N0

(k+1)N0
|yr (n)|2 .
n=1+kN0

(4)

The above Eq. (4) means the average power for whole N0 symbols. Thus, it is further derived as follows:

Φ0

=

|hr |2 Ps

+

Nω r

+

2 N0

N0 n=1

{hrs(n)ωrH (n)},

(5)

Φk

=

|µk |2 Ps

+

Nω r

+

2 N0

(k+1)N0 n=kNo +1

{µks(n)ωrH (n)}, (6)

where Nwr represents the average noise power and µk is expressed as

µk = hr + hkgkηk.

(7)

2) Second subslot: Both a tag for message transmission and a tag for artiﬁcial noise generation are selected at the second subslot. After selecting the i-th tag with the maximum channel gain between a tag and the reader, the j-th tag with the minimum channel gain is selected as follows.

i = argmax|hkgkηk|, j = argmin|hkgkηk|.

i∈K

j∈K\{i}

After selecting the tags, the leader broadcasts U symbols to inform the scheduling results to all tags. Here, U symbols represent the indices of the selected tags in a binary coded modulation manner. Next, all tags check the reader’s scheduling decision and if it is selected, the corresponding tag responses a conﬁrmation message using next U symbols. On the contrary, the non-scheduled tags remain in absorbing mode.
3) Final subslot: At the ﬁnal subslot, the selected tags communicate with the reader. The selected i-th tag and jth tag simultaneously modulate and transmit the message and artiﬁcial noise, respectively. The received signal at the reader is expressed as

yr(n) = hrs(n) + s(n)Bi(n)giηihi + δj,r(n) + ωr(n), (8)

where δj,r(n) = Bj(n)gjηjhj. For the proposed ANTS scheme, if the channel gain between
a tag and the reader is too large, the performance can be degraded since the reader can be also affected by artiﬁcial noise. From this reason, we additionally proposed to apply a successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique to completely eliminate the effect of artiﬁcial noise at the reader. We assume that the artiﬁcial noise is generated by a pseudo random pattern generator based on tag identiﬁcation (ID) at both the reader and the selected tag for artiﬁcial noise generation. Thus, the reader can completely remove the artiﬁcial noise using the

433

3

artiﬁcial noise data pattern and the estimated channel gain. Consequently, the perfect channel estimation is required for applying the SIC technique. It is assumed that the channel estimation can be done using the estimation method performed in [11].
In order to detect the backscattered information B(n), the reader calculates the average power from the received signal. Then, it is detected by using the method proposed in the [12] and [13]. The average power at the reader is derived by

ΦB (q)

=

1 Nt

q∗Nt
|yr(n + Np
n=(q −1)∗Nt +1

+ Ns)|2,

(9)

where Nt denotes the number of samples for a symbol of s(n) transmitted by the RF source. Next, the reader compares the calculated Φ0 and Φi with calculated ΦB and determines whether the backscattered bit is ’1’ or ’0’ according the the
following decision rule.

Bˆi,r(q) =

0, if |ΦB(q) − Φ0| < |ΦB(q) − Φi|, 1, if |ΦB(q) − Φ0| > |ΦB(q) − Φi|.

(10)

B. At Eavesdropper The received signal at the eavesdropper is expressed as

ye(n) = hes(n) + s(n)Bi(n)fiηihi + δj,e(n) + ωe(n), (11)

where δj,e(n) = Bj(n)fjηjhj. Similar to the reader, the eavesdropper calculates Θ0 and
Θi based on the average power of the received signal at the
eavesdropper as follows:

Θ0

=

1 N0

N0
|ye(n)|2,
n=1

(12)

Θi

=

1 N0

i∗N0
|ye(n)|2,
n=(i−1)∗N0

(13)

ΘB (q)

=

1 Nt

q∗Nt
|ye(n + Np
n=(q −1)∗Nt +1

+ NS)|2.

(14)

Next, the eavesdropper compares the calculated Θ0 and Θi with the calculated ΘB and determine whether the backscattered bit is ’1’ or ’0’ based on the following decision rule.

Bˆi,e(q) =

0, if |ΘB(q) − Θ0| < |ΘB(q) − Θi|, 1, if |ΘB(q) − Θ0| > |ΘB(q) − Θi|.

(15)

C. Bit error rate and secrecy data rate

When the bit ’1’ is transmitted but the bit ’0’ is detected and vice versa, a bit error occurs. Consequently, the bit error rate (BER) at the reader and the eavesdropper are expressed, respectively, as

Pb,r = P r(Bˆi,r(q) = Bi(q))

= P r(Bi(q) = 1)P r(Bˆi,r(q) = 0|Bi(q) = 1)

+ P r(Bi(q) = 0)P r(Bˆi,r(q) = 1|Bi(q) = 0), (16)

Pb,e = P r(Bˆi,e(q) = Bi(q)).

Thus, the achievable data rate at the reader and the eavesdropper are expressed, respectively, as

Rr = RsQ(1 − Pb,r)Psel/N,

(18)

Re = RsQ(1 − Pb,e)Psel/N,

(19)

where Rs denotes the source data rate transmitted from the RF source, Q is the number of transmitted data symbols B(n), Psel denotes the probability that the i-th tag is successfully selected by the reader, and N denotes the length of data frame.
As a result, the secrecy data rate is deﬁned as the rate gap
between the reader and the eavesdropper as follows:

Rd = Rr − Re = RsQ(Pb,e − Pb,r)Psel/N. (20)

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we evaluate the proposed ANTS scheme compared with the conventional scheduling scheme (so called Max Power), which selects only a single tag with the maximum power without artiﬁcial noise proposed in [8], in terms of achievable secrecy rate. Moreover, we show the effect of the channel estimation error in the achievable secrecy rate of the proposed ANTS scheme with SIC.
Fig. 3 shows the BER performance for varying average channel gain between a tag and the reader. To investigate the effect of multiuser diversity, the number of tags K is set to 3, 5, and 8. As shown in the ﬁgure, the BER is improved as the number of tags increase thanks to multiuser diversity gains and the proposed ANTS scheme is worse than the conventional Max Power scheme due to the effect of artiﬁcial noise at the reader. However, as the number of tags increases, the BER gap between the proposed ANTS and conventional Max Power schemes is reduced. Even if the proposed ANTS scheme is worse than the conventional Max Power in the perspective of BER, the artiﬁcial noise can positively affect the secrecy rate. Moreover, we can completely remove the effect of the artiﬁcial noise if we apply the SIC technique.
Fig. 4 shows the achievable secrecy rate for varying average channel gain between a tag and the reader when the number of tags (K) is set to 3 and 8, respectively. Basically, the artiﬁcial

noise highly affects the secrecy rate when the number of tags is

small. When the average channel gain is more than 4.5dB and

K = 3, the conventional Max Power scheme achieves a better

secrecy rate than the proposed ANTS scheme . However, as the

number of tags increases, the average channel gain between

a tag and the reader increases and the effects of artiﬁcial

noise is not signiﬁcant thanks to a multiuser diversity gain.

As a result, the proposed ANTS scheme always outperforms

the conventional Max Power scheme in overall. In addition,

the proposed ANTS scheme with SIC can achieve the highest

secrecy rate regardless of the number of tags.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of channel estimation error in terms

of achievable secrecy rate with various channel gains when

K = 8. In this case, the estimated channel is expressed as gˆk = gk + where ∼ CN (0, σe2) [14]. As shown in the ﬁgure, the achievable secrecy rate basically increases as the

average channel gain between a tag and the reader increases.

On the other hand, the larger the channel estimation error

(σe2), if the

the lower the secrecy rate is channel estimation error (σ2

achieved. However, ) is severe (e.g., ∼

even 0.5),

the proposed ANTS scheme with SIC still outperforms the

conventional MaxPower scheme in whole region.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed an artiﬁcial noise-aided tag scheduling (ANTS) scheme with successive interference cancellation (SIC) for ambient backscatter communication systems. Differently from a conventional scheduling scheme, we additionally schedule a tag for generating artiﬁcial noise, which can improve the secrecy rate. The simulation results show that when the number of tags is small, the proposed ANTS scheme provides sufﬁciently good performance in terms of average secrecy rate. The proposed ANTS scheme with SIC signiﬁcantly improves the average secrecy rate by perfectly eliminating the effects of artiﬁcial noise at the reader. Consequently, it always outperforms the conventional scheduling scheme. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of channel estimation error on the average secrecy rate. As a result, even
