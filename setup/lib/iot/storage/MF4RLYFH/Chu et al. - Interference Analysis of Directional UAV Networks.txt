Abstract—We characterize the interference characteristics of directional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks based on the stochastic geometry, where each UAV is equipped with a directional antenna and is placed in three dimensional (3D) locations. In particular, the 3D location of UAVs is assumed to be uniformly distributed in a certain volume, which is modeled by Poisson point process. Given a beamwidth, we ﬁrst design an ideal 3D directional antenna model with a constant gain of both main-lobe and side-lobe. Then, we investigate the aggregate interference at a typical UAV receiver from multiple UAVs. Extensive simulation results show that the aggregate interference becomes signiﬁcantly decreased if the beamwidth decreases or the antenna gain of side-lobe decreases.
Keywords—UAV networks, Poisson point process (PPP), 3D directional antenna, interference, stochastic geometry.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) communication has widely been investigated with various applications due to its low cost of deployment and rapid stabilization of networks. In general, the UAV applications include realtime monitoring of road trafﬁc, remote sensing, disaster communications, product delivery, precision agriculture, etc [1]. Most studies on the UAV communication have focused on performance improvement for terrestrial wireless networks. A framework of UAV-assisted vehicular network was introduced in [2], where it was shown that various performance metrics such as vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, infrastructure coverage, network information collection ability, and network interworking efﬁciency can be improved by cooperating the UAVs and terrestrial communication infrastructure. In [3], coverage probability at a ground user in the UAV-assisted network where multiple UAVs are assumed to located in a three-dimensional (3D) space and they are assumed to move based on the mixed random waypoint mobility model. In [4], a cooperative data dissemination framework was proposed in air-ground integrated networks to maximize the minimum received data amount of ground users, where a terrestrial base station and a single UAV cooperatively serve ground users.
Different from UAV-assisted terrestrial wireless networks, a communication among UAVs has not received much attention from both academia and industry due to relatively rare applications and hash technical challenges such as highly mobility of UAVs and frequent topology changes. However, a network consisting of multiple UAVs which are connected

by air-to-air wireless channels has recently been investigated due to the increase in the deployment of UAVs. In [5], a novel directional medium access control (MAC) protocol was proposed to coordinate transmissions of many UAVs, equipped with directional antennas, in 3D space. Furthermore, an mmWave-enabled UAV swarm network was studied for massive data exchange among UAVs in [6], where a 3D interference graph was exploited by considering mobility, interference, and energy consumption simultaneously.
As the UAV network become denser, the interference among UAV wireless links tends to limit the network performance and thus it is important to analyze the interference characteristics of the UAV network in 3D space as shown in Fig. 1. Existing studies only focused on a simple 3D wireless network without considering the effect of side-lobe of the directional antennas. In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce an ideal 3D directional antenna model considering the effect of side-lobe and then analyze the interference characteristics of the directional UAV network where UAVs are randomly located in 3D space according to Poisson Point Process (PPP).
II. INTERFERENCE MODELING
A. Directional Antenna Model in 3D Space
In the ideal omni-directional antenna, the radiation pattern is uniformly radiated to the area of the isotropic sphere. When the radius of sphere is set to 1, surface area Ao is to be 4π. Since the energy source power Po is radiated on Ao, radiation

radiated from an antenna per unit sphere. Assuming that Go

is 1, then Po is to be 4π.

In contrast, in the directional antenna, the radiation pattern

is consisted of a main-lobe and a side-lobe. The same Po as the omni energy source is separated into Pm and Ps where Pm and Ps denote the radiated energy on the areas of the main-lobe and side-lobe, respectively. Let the surface area of

main-lobe and side-lobe with beamwidth ω be Am and As, respectively. The area sum of Am and As is equal to Ao, i.e., 4π. Therefore, Am and As are calculated by as follows:

ωω

Am(ω) =

sin φ dφ dρ,

ρ=0 φ=0

(1)

As(ω) = Ao − Am(ω),

where ρ and φ denote azimuth and elevation in a spherical

coordinate system, respectively.

Simarly, the radiation intensity of main-lobe and side-lobe

is expressed as follows:

Gm

=

Pm , Am (ω)

Gs

Ps As (ω)

=

Po − Pm . Ao − Am (ω)

(2)

The energy source power is calculated by

Pm = Po − Gs (Ao − Am (ω)) .

(3)

The gain of directional antenna is deﬁned as the ratio

of the radiation intensity of directional antenna to that of

omni-directional antenna. Since Go is 1, the antenna gain of

main-lobe is Gm and the antenna gain of main-lobe is Gs ,

respectively. Therefore, given ω and Gs , the gain of main-

lobe is derived as follows:

Gm

=

4π

− Gs (Ao − Am (ω)) . Am (ω)

B. Network Model in 3D Space

We consider a 3-dimensional UAV networks where simulta-
neously transmitting nodes (i.e., UAVs) are distributed as PPP Φ = {x1, x2, · · · } on R3 of intensity λ (C1). We present yi as a receiving node corresponding to xi. We assume that the pair of xi and yi is perfectly aligned toward the center direction of beamwidth ω as well as the distance between xi and yi is retained with the distance of R (C2). The value on z-axis of xi, i.e., the height of UAV hxi must be between the minimum of height hmin and the maximum of height hmax, (C3). In summary, xi and yi are randomly and uniformly generated along with the following constraints:
C1 : xi = (axi, bxi, hxi), yi = (ayi, byi, hyi) on R3, C2 : xi − yi = R, C3 : hmin ≤ hxi, hyi ≤ hmax.
A typical receiver yo is located in the center of an observing target area, and the pair of xo and yo also retains the distance R. To easily calculate antenna gain, we translate the carte-
sian coordinate system into the spherical coordinate system. Elevation φ is the angle between the vector of r and the zaxis whereas azimuth ρ is the angle between x-axis and the projection of the vector r on the xy plane as shown in Fig. 2. The angles (ρxio , φxio ) and (ρxoi , φxoi ) are generated by

Transmit antenna gain at the typical node xo from interference node xi is expressed as follows:

where Pt denotes transmit power, and di denotes the distance

where η denotes noise

III. SIMULATION RESULTS
System parameters are set to R = 100 m, α = 2*, service area A = 10 km × 10 km, λA = 100 ∼ 500 nodes, and ω = {10◦, 30◦, 60◦, 120◦}, and Gs = 0 ∼ 0.2.
Fig. 3 shows the effect of Gm for varying Gs and ω in dB scale units. Fig. 4 shows the CDF of aggregate interference according to ω. In case of an omni-directional antenna, aggregate interference is between -48 dB and -25 dB. However,

*The path-loss exponent for air-to-air was also estimated at 2.05 (slightly more than the free space path-loss exponent of 2.0 [7].

for ω = 10◦, aggregate interference is between -70dB and 8dB. Although 70% of aggregate interference is less than 65dB, about 20% cause strong interference greater than -40 dB. Strong interference begins to decrease at 60◦ and there is no overall strong interference at 120◦. Therefore, strong interference cancellation seems to be necessary for the narrow beamwidth.
Fig. 5 shows the CDF of aggregate interference according to the variation of Gs at ω = 120◦. For Gs = 0, 99% of the nodes cause small interference amount less than -100dB, therefore, As Gs increases, the amount of interference increases due to side-lobe. Fig. 6 shows CDF of SINR according to ω. For small ω, the antenna gain of the main-lobe is large as shown in Fig. 3. From this, it can be seen that the SINR increases due to a sharp increase in the desired signal. In case of ω = 10◦, SINR can be seen to increase sharply due to 70% weak interference and the strong desired signal.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we considered a large directional UAV network in 3D space where UAVs are randomly located according to PPP. It was shown that the narrower beamwidth increases the signal strength but it may induce strong interference to other UAV wireless links as well. Therefore, interference management techniques are required for the directional UAV network. In addition, the side-lobe signiﬁcantly affects the interference characteristics. We leave the interference management such as interference avoidance or cancellation for the directional UAV network as a further study.
