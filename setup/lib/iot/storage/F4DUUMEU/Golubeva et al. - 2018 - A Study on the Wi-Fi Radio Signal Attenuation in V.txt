I. INTRODUCTION
Using Wi-Fi to data transfer over short distances is used everywhere. But often it is necessary to take into account the negative impact of various building structures when installing a Wi-Fi network. Full-scale studies on this problem have not been conducted, although there are many studies on Wi-Fi technology or implementations of new technologies with improved characteristics.
In paper [1] the new IEEE 802.11ah, which is a promising communication standard, is being analyzed. This standard supports a large number of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). It provides attractive features such as: improved scalability, low power consumption and large area coverage. In paper, the authors analyze IEEE 802.11ah performance and compare it with the known alternative IEEE 802.15.4. The simulation results show that new 802.11ah standard works better than 802.15.4 in terms of association time, bandwidth, delay and coverage range.
The paper [2] is devoted to the implementation of the new technology 60-GHz Wi-Fi based on the IEEE s802.11ad standard. This frequency range become attractive in recent years due to the high potential of large bandwidth in the unlicensed 60 GHz band, which allows data transfer with a several gigabit rate. However, the commercialization of 60GHz Wi-Fi is not yet widely used, mainly because of the high coverage limitations, as well as the lack of a various applications.
Thanks to the promising applications in e-health and entertainment services, a wireless body area network (WBAN) also receives a close attention [3]. One of the most important tasks for WBAN is to monitor and maintain the quality of service (QoS). In the paper being described, the authors reviewed the probabilities of delivery and delay in a dynamic

environment determined by human mobility. The authors also reviewed another important problem - ensuring energy efficiency in such network with limited resources.
The quite interesting paper [4] is devoted to an experimental study of the acceptable Wi-Fi radiation level. Studies were conducted on a Wi-Fi network in a typical room inside the building. The experiments were carried out by quantifying the exposure levels found in different parts of the building when the router terminal devices are in certain positions. In addition, an influence on the traffic type radiation power, which is transferred through the network, was studied. The exposure evaluation was carried out by collecting measurements using the new dosimeter "EME Spy-140" in a real scenario and comparing the results with the corresponding theoretical levels and other studies. 4,875 samples were collected, 25 places in the building were analyzed. The ROSMLE method was used to adjust the levels to statistical distributions. The maximum exposure for WLAN (WiFi network being studied is disabled) was 0.039 V/m. Using WiFi network in operation, maximum exposure increases to 2.6 V/m in the far field region of the transmitters (with 90th percentile of 2.2 V/m). Regarding the traffic type, fluctuations up to 10 dB were detected for the exact same position, depending on whether the Web or P2P traffic is being sent. Differences in 62 dB were found in the average values between the different rooms in the building. All values below the threshold of 61 V/m are set by standards (at least 12 times lower). Certainly, this type of research is of great importance to raise awareness that radiation emanating from this technology is not insignificant and should be monitored, and also provides an overview of the level fluctuations in this context.
The authors conduct researches of various aspects of an automated control system complex for earth-moving and construction machines [5-12]. As a part of research special attention was paid to detailed review of the Wi-Fi technology. This paper describes the results of pilot studies on the equipment which was specially developed and made by the authors.
The experiment consisted of the following: Experimental Equipment was developed for measuring the radio signal attenuation (fading) in range of 2.4 GHz passing through the construction obstacles made from various materials and with different distances up to obstacles (the picture of equipment is given below, figure 1).

The wireless communication channel between two computers with the built-in Wi-Fi devices was adjusted and data transmission was carried out between them. Originally data was being transmitted inside the case without obstacles on the signal distribution path, and then the partitions made from various construction materials have been used as obstacles (glass, wood, particleboard, gypsum cardboard, ceramics, concrete, Plexiglas etc.)
On the basis of the pilot study, the radio waves propagation model in various construction obstacles at 2.4 GHz frequency range was studied.

During the first part of experiment the wireless communication channel between two computers with the builtin Wi-Fi adapters was adjusted without data transmission. I.e. only service packets were being transferred. The wave-guide was not connected. During the data transfer from the transmitter (TX) to the receiver (RX) the 10 readings of signal strength and signal quality at the TX and signal strength and signal quality at the RX was carried out. The signal levels measurements are resulted in Table III.

The results collected during experiment have shown that passing of radio signal indoors differs from its passing in waveguide. In case of installing the panels from various materials between the receiver and the transmitter the nature of the radio signal propagation also changes.
III. CONCLUSION
In conclusion it should be noted that the developed and created Experimental Equipment for measuring the radio signal attenuation in range of 2.4 GHz passing through the construction obstacles made from various materials allows to conduct different pilot studies for use in construction branch during design, construction and operation of buildings.
Based on study results the data of influence of various materials on radio signal propagation have been obtained. Comparative graphs of signal levels on the strength and quality for various materials were constructed. During the experiment and on the basis of the following analysis of the received results such facts has been found out that losses depend on

722

distance between the transmitter and the panel, as well as on the number of panels and the panel material. This dependence has nonlinear character, therefore it is difficult to describe it by existing methods of the radio waves internal propagation modeling.
Besides this, the presented Experimental Equipment makes possible to create various disturbance or interference situations and also to replace adapters in computers to any other that significantly expands research areas.
