Abstract—In this paper, we statistically analyze the BER performance of a threshold-based parallel multiple beam selection scheme for a free-space optical (FSO) based system with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in cases where a pointing error has occurred under Gamma turbulence conditions, which are a good approximation of Gamma-Gamma distribution. Our derived results based on the Gamma distribution as an approximation of the Gamma-Gamma distribution can be used as approximated performance measure (lower) bounds.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in ﬁber-optic communications has been shown to increase the capacity and bandwidth [1]. Similarly, in FSO systems, a WDM access network is a realistic proposition and feasible because both conventional ﬁber-optic communication systems and free-space optical (FSO) systems use similar system components and transmission wavelengths [2]. However, the received signals at the receiver generated based on WDM may not be valid or may not have an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to atmospheric attenuation, whereas in conventional ﬁber-optical communication systems, all the received signals are valid.
Based on it, we analyze the BER performance of parallel multiple-beam selection scheme for FSO systems using WDM. More speciﬁcally, we consider a parallel multiple-beam selection scheme based on a threshold-based selection scheme [3]. With this scheme, higher spectral efﬁciency can be obtained while the complexity of implementation caused by applying the selection-based beam selection scheme can be reduced without a considerable performance loss.
II. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODELS
We consider a point-to-point FSO link using heterodyne detection (HD) [4]. We assume a block-turbulence FSO channel in which the turbulence is assumed to be constant but in which the turbulence independently changes in different rounds. We also assume that an FSO link mainly experiences both atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors.
We assume that induced FSO channel turbulence is modeled by the Gamma distribution. The Gamma PDF is found to be a good approximation of the Gamma-Gamma distribution, which are widely accepted conditions in the current literature, by use of the moment-matching method. Approximation using

the tractable Gamma distribution can signiﬁcantly simplify the performance analysis of composite fading channels.
Another factor that affects the reliability of FSO channels is building sway which leads to a misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver, consequently causing pointing errors, which also seriously degrade system performance. For this reason, we also consider the effects of pointing errors.
With the TPMBS scheme, the scheduler selects all the valid optical signals for each time slot with a link condition above a preselected threshold based on the the channel state information back to the transmitter through a reliable feedback path (i.e. RF feedback channel).

III. AVERAGE BER ANALYSIS OF TPMBS

Based on the mode of operation, the selected beam has

a conditional PDF of a truncated (above the threshold, γT )

random variable (RV). Therefore, the PDF and the CDF can

be expressed as for γ

≥

γT , fγT B (γ)

=

fγ (γ) 1−Fγ (γT )

and

FγT B (γ)

=

, Fγ (γ)−Fγ (γT )
1−Fγ (γT )

where

fγ (·)

and

Fγ (·) are

the

PDF and CDF of an instantaneous SNR at the receiver over

the various channel models, respectively.

With coherent and non-coherent binary modulation, BERn

can

be

written

as

BER (γ)

=

Γ(p,qγ ) 2Γ(p)

,

where

p

and

q

represent

the parameters deﬁning the type of detection mechanism and

modulation and p = 1

type, respectively, for non-coherent

as or

p

for

for

FSK and q = 1 for PSK. Then, the average BER can be

obtained based on the given turbulence distribution as

Z∞

BER = BER(γ)FγT B (γ) |∞ γT −

With the help of [5, eq. (6.5.25)], the average BER can be rewritten for mathematical convenience as

BER = BERI − BERII,

Here, with the help of [5, eq. (3.381.3)], (4) can be rewritten

as

In both (3) and (5), we still need Fγ (γ).

With the help of [6] and then utilizing [7,

Eq.(06.06.21.0002.01)], Fγ (γ) can be given as

where μHD is the electrical average SNR, ξ is the ratio between the equivalent beam radius, and the pointing error

and

and β are the atmospheric turbulence conditions. Then, for

the closed-form expression of BERII , we can directly obtain a closed-form result by substituting the closed-form results

given in (6) into (5).

For BERI , with (6), we can be rewrite (3) as

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this section, we present some selected result, especially the average BER of the selected beams. We veriﬁed these results via computer-based Monte-Carlo simulations, we evaluated the analytical results numerically and show them under both varying turbulent FSO channel conditions and pointing

errors. In the ﬁgures, a marker and a line are given for the analytical and simulation results, respectively.
The FSO link is modeled as a strong turbulence channel based on the FSO channels in [8]. Speciﬁcally, we vary the fading/scintillation parameters (i.e., α and β, respectively) and the pointing error parameters (i.e., ξ). In Fig. 1, the average BER performance comparisons based on the Gamma distribution and the Gamma-Gamma distribution under HD technique, especially considering worst case, strong turbulence (i.e., α = 2.064 and β = 1.342) and strong pointing error (i.e., ξ = 1). The result shows that under the worst conditions, the approximate Gamma turbulence model provides almost the same performance. With this sufﬁciently accurate approximation using the Gamma distribution, we can simplify the performance analysis as a function of tractable function (i.e., Gamma function).
