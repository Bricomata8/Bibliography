Abstract—Internet of Things (IoT) envisions the idea of universal smart connectivity of everything between physical and digital world. Every smart device in IoT consists of a power source sensors, microprocessor and transceiver module to sense, communicate and exchange data among each other. In distributed IoT networks, the energy efﬁciency of the smart objects is a key factor in the overall network performance. Most of the times IoT’s have to deal with low power and communication disconnection due to the limited memory, processing capability, and power. Few techniques for stringent Quality of Service (QoS) routing in IoT have been proposed despite its great impact on future network. In this paper, we propose energyefﬁcient possibilistic routing based on fuzzy logic model for IoT to controls the transmission of the routing request packets to increase the network lifetime and decrease the packet loss. The proposed fuzzy logic controller accepts the input descriptors in routing metrics to optimize the network performance. The proposed algorithm adopts energy-efﬁcient possibilistic routing by using fuzzy inference rules to merge energy aware metrics for choosing the optimal delivery path. In the simulations, we verify that the proposed algorithm has longer IoT network lifetime and consumes the residual energy of each smart node more consistently when compared with the existing traditional protocols.

I. INTRODUCTION
IoT has been visualized and improved the communica-
tion and integration with smart objects known as things.
The IoT network allows new systems of communication and
interaction between people and smart objects and between
smart objects themselves [1]. Each smart object node in IoT
network communicates with other objects and thus plays a
deﬁned role in the network [2]. The smart objects or things in
IoT network are equipped with sensors and radio-frequency
identiﬁcation (RFID) systems such that the connectivity re-
quirements between the IoT things are achieved over wireless
communication standards such as Wiﬁ, Wimax, LTE, and
cloud computing [3-5]. Thus, the things equipped with sensors
in IoT network have limited computing, memory, transceiver
module and power capabilities, therefore, communicate in a
short-range distance [6]. In IoT, the energy constraint is a very
crucial issue, as things are usually operated on limited battery
power.
From building automation, automotive, smart cities and
smart factories to wearables, health care and precision agri-

culture, the IoT touches every aspect of our lives. Thus, the main strength of the IoT network is the high impact on several aspects of everyday-life and behavior of the potential private and business users [2]. Therefore, to satisfy the demanding requirements of IoT potential users, the smart objects can sense, gather and transmit data in the IoT network in a continuous way [7]. A large number of smart objects are deployed in the IoT network and as a result a large amount of power are consumed in the whole process. To achieve this, the IoT smart objects require energy efﬁcient communication to remain part of the smart network for a long time. Therefore, energy efﬁcient routing plays a crucial role in the IoT to reduce power consumption and operational costs, lessen pollution and emissions and make the most of surveillance and environmental conservation [8-11].
The realization of energy efﬁcient routing to achieve a smart communication in IoT is the research objective of this paper. Many energy efﬁcient schemes for other networks such as, wireless sensor networks (WSN) [12-14] and ad-hoc networks [15-17] have been widely proposed in the recent past to prolong network lifetime by reducing the energy consumption of sensor nodes. However, the traditional energy efﬁcient routing metrics deﬁned for WSN and ad-hoc networks are not appropriate in IoT due to its dynamic network topology, insensitive packet loss, data rates, link capacity, link quality, channel diversity, interference, and various other routing requirements [1].
In this paper, we have investigated the different parameters of the smart objects to ensure an energy efﬁcient communication in IoT network. To design an energy efﬁcient routing protocol to provide support for IoT applications, the communication protocols must adjust their routing performance based on the IoT network parameters. However, it is not feasible to accurately and simultaneously achieve energy efﬁcient routing, mobility of smart objects and application services in IoTs through mathematical models. To address this problem, fuzzy logic is used as an alternative model as it has potential to deal with conﬂicting situations and imprecision in data using heuristic human reasoning without the need of complex mathematical models [18, 19].
The dynamic nature of IoT networks due to smart objects and people mobility make the communication among smart

objects and people more difﬁcult. Through a fuzzy controller, an energy efﬁcient routing is proposed to deliver the sensed data among smart objects and people in IoT network. In more detail, the proposed scheme is achieving its objective by enabling each smart object to consume energy approximately at the optimal energy consumption rate to guarantee IoT application services. Consequently, since the smart objects in IoT network may not be enough to satisfy two requirements, i.e., energy efﬁciency routing and mobility at once in the network for the whole period of communication. Therefore, the proposed fuzzy controller scheme adopts the input descriptors, such as mobility, Expected Transmission Based (ETX) [20], and energy for the optimal routing among smart objects in IoT. ETX is a metric that aims to provide high throughput, by measuring the packet delivery ratio of the link between neighboring nodes [1]. To adjust the optimal values of the controller, the proposed scheme utilizes standard membership functions to determine routing between smart objects in IoT network. As a result, the performance of the possibilistic energy efﬁcient routing mechanism can be improved by only deliver the sensed data to the selected smart object in the IoT network. The objective of the proposed adaption is to not only decrease the delay and control mobility, but also to improve the successful delivery of packets through energy efﬁcient routing in IoT. Simulation results are given to prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in the performance metrics.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II contains a review of related works. Section III introduces the proposed routing scheme. Section IV is the detail discussion about fuzzy logic model and Section V is the performance evaluation. Section VI summarizes the paper conclusion.
II. RELATED WORKS
IoT routing remains a hot topic in last years that has attracting the research community and thus intense works have been devoted to this ﬁeld. Traditional routing protocols for Ad hoc networks and WSN can’t directly applicable in IoT. Energy consumption of smart objects, mobility of smart objects, and the type of the IoT’s middle-ware are three primary concerns that may affect routing in IoT [3]. Numerous energy efﬁcient routing mechanisms have been proposed for IoT networks to efﬁciently communicate between things and people [1-3, 7]. This work focuses on the techniques to optimize energy efﬁcient routing with respect to mobility and ETX. However, this section also surveys the existing routing schemes having energy, delay and other parameters for IoT networks.
Communicating sensed data from a source to a destination node is one of the most important tasks to be carried out in a large scale and dynamic IoT network. The typical reactive routing protocols such as ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) [21] and dynamic source routing (DSR) [22] are designed to ﬁnd just the shortest path without any consideration of the energy consumption of a node. The EEPR algorithm [1] employs both the residual energy of a node and the ETX value as the routing metrics and thus stochastically controls the number of the RREQ packets using the residual energy and

ETX value of a link on the path. The EECBR algorithm [3] performed a matching between IoT events and the subscribers. EECBR routed the events through a virtual topology constructed from the bottom to the top. The variance between the remaining energy and the initial ones is very small in EECBR which allows extending the lifetime of IOT sensors. In [7], the authors proposed the framework for IoT deployment having scalability features towards more extensible. Furthermore, an optimization scheme which is constrained by the loads on wireless links and energy expenditure support the deployment of an energy efﬁcient IoT.
In [8], the authors proposed that the green deployment schemes for IoT plays a vital role in its massive implementation. The authors investigated the problem of cost effectively arranging network objects to form a green IoT and proposed MECA leveraging the clustering principle and a Steinertree algorithm to solve the optimization problem. In [23], the authors proposed an algorithm that controls the probability of forwarding RREQ packets according to the residual energy of the node. An energy-efﬁcient routing protocol based on AODV protocol by considering the transmission power and remaining energy capacity of the mobile nodes is proposed in [24]. Similarly, the probability based improved broadcasting algorithm [25] reduces the RREQ messages by using a broadcasting probability together with the consideration of the residual energy of nodes.
Most of the current routing protocols use hop count as their route selection metric to ﬁnd the best path between source and destination smart objects of IoT. However, considering only hop count as the routing metric is not appropriate in IoT with dynamic network topology. The ETX metric [20] aims to provide high throughput, by measuring the packet delivery ratio of the link between neighboring nodes.
All the above existing schemes focused on efﬁcient routing in different dynamic networks. However, the above methods do not consider the link quality of the route, which decreases the network lifetime by wasting the residual energy of the nodes with poor link quality. None of them tried to ﬁnd solution for the reliability, scalability and quality of the required routes changes over time due to things mobility. As a result, certain logical connection can become loose which effects routing by increasing time and network overhead. One of the objectives of our proposed scheme is to route sensed data among smart objects in IoT environment with control node mobility while maintaining the smallest possible delay.
III. PROPOSED ROUTING SCHEME
IoT networks has many smart objects deployed in a wide area and therefore having a more complex networking scenario than regular wireless networks. Routing of sensed data among smart objects in IoT systems is critical as end-to-end path between source and destination nodes are not guaranteed. Furthermore, the restricted wireless connectivity, amount of sensed data and smart sensor objects limited resources such as low battery energy, low power and low memory cause the

321

increased processing requirements in large scale IoT environment more harder. The objective of the energy efﬁcient routing for IoT problem is to ensure the IoT network lifetime at least as long as the user or application demands. Since the network lifetime comes to an end when any node collapses its energy, the best way to satisfy the IoT user or application demands for a network lifetime is to distribute energy consumption adequately among the smart nodes.
In this article, we propose an energy efﬁcient routing with control mobility and delay for IoT systems to achieve user or application-speciﬁed network lifetime through a novel algorithm based on a fuzzy logic controller. To achieve the desired objective, we endorse a strategy where smart objects are categorized into a 3-tier model, i.e., sensing, relay and base to provide different services in IoT environment. Sensing objects lies in the tier-1 and are eligible to perform sensing and transmit the sensed data to available relay node. Thus, sensing objects have ﬁxed and limited transmission range to transmit the data to relay objects. The tier-2 relay objects are more powerful and thus function as a local base station to collect sensed data from sensing objects in its range. The tier-3 objects are more intelligent and have high dynamic transmission range to forward data packet towards destination via internet. Tier2 relay objects transmit data packet to other tier-2 objects or tier-3 base objects at a ﬁxed transmission power.
To carry out IoT communications in a maximum network lifetime, the proposed scheme places the minimum number of tier-2 relay objects and tier-3 base objects in the IoT ﬁeld such that each sensing object can communicate with at least one tier-2 relay object and each tier-2 object further communicate with at least one relay object in same tier and tier-3 base object relay towards the internet. The following Fig. 1 shows the 3-tiered sensing, relay and base object placement model.

minimum number of smart objects are selected as a relay objects to ensure the connectivity of smart objects in the IoT ﬁeld. Each tier-1 sensing object will be covered by at least one tier-2 relay object. Similarly, in tier-3, base objects are selected to ensure the connectivity of tier-2 relay objects and internet towards the destination object.
IV. FUZZY LOGIC MODEL
Fuzzy logic was ﬁrst introduced by Lotﬁ-Zadeh [26] in the mid-1960s. Since then, its applications have speedily extended due to its simplicity, clarity and suitability [6]. Therefore, instead of classical linear controllers or mathematical models, fuzzy logic controller is use in this article to perform energy efﬁcient routing in IoT networks. Furthermore, fuzzy systems are very useful in situations involving a highly complex system whose behaviors are not well understood and in situations where an approximate, but fast, solution is warranted [11]. Since energy efﬁcient routing, mobility, delay and ETX in IoT networks are dealing with both kinds of situations, therefore a fuzzy system can be an ideal possible solution. To deploy it in the real world, the proposed fuzzy controller algorithm must be installed on all 3-tier smart objects in IoT network.
The proposed fuzzy system consists of three parts; fuzziﬁcation, inference engine and defuzziﬁcation, as shown in Fig. 2, along with fuzzy system input descriptors. The fuzzy logic controller determines and assign a 3-tier role to smart objects based on the input descriptor to perform energy efﬁcient communication in IoT environment.

Fig. 1. System framework for IoT deployment
In the 3-tier smart object selection model, all smart objects are considered as sensing objects in the tier-1. In tier-2, a

A. Fuzziﬁcation
In fuzziﬁcation, the input variables should be converted to linguistic values to make a crisp quantity fuzzy and determine the membership degree. In the proposed scheme, the input crisp values are mobility, ETX and energy, as shown in Fig. 2. Fuzzy logic evaluates information using fuzzy sets, each of which is represented by a linguistic variable. The fuzzy set linguistic variables, such as, very low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H) or very high (VH) are used in this article. Let S represent the collection of smart objects in IoT system, then a fuzzy set in S is deﬁned by a set of ordered pairs. Moreover, the membership function µ(O) represents a degree of assets for each object O to a fuzzy set, and provides a mapping of objects to a membership value in the interval [0 - 1].
The fuzzy sets H and VH contain smart objects sensing (S) in tier-1, relay (R) in tier-2 and base (B) in tier-3 having µN (S) = 1, µS(R) = 1 and µR(B) = 1, where µ represents the degree of membership function and N represents the

322

number of smart objects in the IoT network. The fuzzy set M contains sensing objects S having µN (S) > 0, relay objects R having µS(R) > 0 and base objects B having µR(B) > 0. Similarly, fuzzy sets L and VL contain sensing objects S having 0 < µN (S) < 1, relay objects R having 0 < µS(R) < 1 and base objects B having 0 < µR(B) < 1. The outputs of this stage are fuzzy values that can be processed by the inference engine to deﬁne the fuzzy output value.

B. Fuzzy Inference Model and Rules The fuzzy inference model performs logical reasoning and
concludes a conclusion based on the empirical rules derived from the knowledge base through fuzziﬁcation. Fuzzy logic used the most trusted way of knowledge representation in inference engine, such as IF premise (antecedent), THEN conclusion (consequent), where the premise is composed of fuzzy input variables connected by logical functions and consequent is a fuzzy output variable.
The input descriptors, mobility, ETX and energy, in a proposed fuzzy control system have the linguistic values VL, L, M, H and VH, and the membership functions are shown in ﬁgures 3, 4 and 5 respectively. The membership functions indicate that any input descriptor value of a smart object increases or decreases, the change occurs accordingly. The proposed scheme ensures that a fuzzy controller keeps the energy consumption balance among smart objects to achieve maximum lifetime in IoT network. To show the membership function for mobility, ETX and energy, the fuzzy controller generates an output value from the set of (0,2) and (0,1). The mobile nodes can be smart objects and/or people moving around the region or by vehicles with controlled speed 0 ≤ M obility ≤ 2m/hour(h).
Fig. 3. Fuzzy membership function for mobility
The ETX metric is the link quality between the smart objects in IoT for the transmission required to reach to destination. In general, probe packets are used to obtain the ETX value of a link [20]. Each smart object periodically broadcasts the smallsized probe packets to its one-hop neighbor nodes. The ETX metric deﬁned by [1] is utilized in this work. The membership function of ETX metric is shown below in Fig. 4.
To consider each smart object energy, the fuzzy controller assigns a triangular fuzzy value that speciﬁes the range for a given level instead of a particular discrete value. Thus, the triangular fuzzy value provides an easy solution for the

Fig. 4. Fuzzy membership function for ETX
described problem with two parameters, i.e., center point and the distance between the extreme points and the center point. To show the membership function for energy, the fuzzy controller generates an output value from the set of (0,1).
Fig. 5. Fuzzy membership function for energy
1) Rules for Tier-2 and -3 Object Selection: The last step in the fuzzy inference process is defuzziﬁcation. Fuzziness helps us to evaluate the rules, but the ﬁnal output of a fuzzy system has to be a crisp number. Thus, the defuzziﬁcation process of fuzzy logic controller structure converts the fuzzy output back to the crisp or classical output to the control objective, just as fuzziﬁcation is the conversion of a precise quantity to a fuzzy quantity [6]. The most popular and reliable defuzziﬁcation technique for actual application, i.e., Mamdani centroid technique [27] is utilized in the proposed fuzzy controller. The defuzziﬁcation phase generates two outputs tier-2 relay and tier-3 base objects. Both objects are based on the mobility, ETX and remaining energy of the smart object in IoT environment.
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION In this section, we validate the performance of the proposed fuzzy scheme through ns-2.35 simulation tool. The IoT scenario contain total number of 150 smart objects and are completely distributed in the 500 × 500 m2 region. Initial energy of each smart object is set to 300 J, where sensing and listening power is considered as 0.350 W and 0.320 W respectively. Similarly, the transmission power is assigned between 0.550 W to 0.750 W for tier-1, tier-2 and tier-3 layer objects. The receiving power and sensing frequency of all smart objects are assigned to 0.350 W and 0.1 Hz respectively. The simulation is conducted for 100 rounds. The

result the delay is also high. The delay in EEPR algorithm is good at the beginning of the communication where less number of objects are involved in sensing and transmitting of sensed data as shown in ﬁgure 7. As the network active for log time and more smart objects start sensing and sharing the delay ratio also increased in EEPR and reached to 2.50s. The delay ratio in the proposed scheme is controlled from the begging to end of the network and recorded below 1.7s when the network is fully loaded. The proposed fuzzy controller showed an acceptable value for delay for loaded and mobile IoT network shown in Fig. 7.

proposed energy efﬁcient routing scheme is compared with EEPR algorithm [1].
We validated the performance of an energy efﬁcient IoT lifetime using the fuzzy-based algorithm. The IoT network lifetime comes to an end when all objects consumed more than 90% of its energy and any one object collapses all its energy. The proposed fuzzy controller utilized the mobility, ETX and energy parameters among smart objects in an efﬁcient way and thus extended lifetime of the IoT network as shown in Fig. 6. The fuzzy controller selects tier-2 relay and tier-3 base objects on deﬁned inference rules to keep level of energy balance among all things in the IoT network. The total energy consumption among smart objects in total simulation time is illustrated in Fig. 6, where a smart object is transmitting packets to its neighbor relay node toward the base. The IoT network lifetime based on EEPR algorithm comes to an end at 4300s where the lifetime is extended to 5500s by proposed fuzzy scheme.

Fig. 7. Routing delay at 0 ≤ M obility Speed ≤ 2m/h
Performance comparison of successful data packets in an energy efﬁcient routing between the proposed fuzzy scheme and EEPR is discussed in this section. To evaluate the performance of packet in Fig. 8, the simulation is performed on the average ratio of successful end-to-end packets delivery between source and destination objects. The proposed protocol selects the tier-2 relay object and tier-3 base object through the fuzzy controller to achieve the end-to-end successful transmission in the IoT network. The simulation is run for 100 times considering different settings of packet and plotted the average results in Figure 8. Furthermore, it is discerned from Figure 8, that the proposed scheme improves the successful packet delivery ratio to more than 94% within acceptable deadline for trafﬁc of different priority levels as compared to EEPR scheme achieved less than 90% successful packet delivery.

Fig. 6. IoT lifetime VS Energy consumption
The routing delay in this article is deﬁned as, how long it takes for a bit of data to travel across the IoT network from source to destination object. Routing delay is directly affected by changes occurred in network load and objects mobility. When the tier-1, -2 and -3 smart objects mobility is between 1 ≤ M obility Speed ≤ 2m/h, the routing is hard and as a

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a new energy efﬁcient routing algorithm with control mobility and acceptable delay is proposed for IoT network. The proposed energy-efﬁcient possibilistic routing algorithm based on fuzzy logic model for IoT controls the transmission of the routing packets to increase the network lifetime and decrease the packet loss. The energy efﬁcient routing is achieved through fuzzy controller by using mobility, ETX and energy as input descriptors. It is proved that fuzzy logic is an accurate mechanism applied to any conﬂicting parameters in IoT applications for effective and efﬁcient routing. Furthermore, the design of the fuzzy-logic system is simple and easy, which allows users/applications to deﬁne different variables, sets and rules, depending on environment and the smart object features. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy algorithm has longer network lifetime, less transmission delay and high packet delivery ratio when compared with other protocols for IoT.
