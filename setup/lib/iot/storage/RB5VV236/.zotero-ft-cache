CELL (5I050) - TD 2
Exercise 1: 5 000 users are connected to a switch. During the 6 peak hours, 120 000 have been switched by this switch. The duration of each call is about 3 minutes. What is the traffic of each user? Exercise 2: Two switches are interconnected by 3 trunks. The traffic between these two switches is of 0.2 Erlangs. What is the call blocking probability of this system?
Exercise 3: We have traffic of 150 Erlangs between two central offices. Calculate the number of trunks needed so that the call blocking probability does not exceed 10-4? (Use two methods to find the answer: Erlang-B table and the approximation formula.) Exercise 4: Consider an area covering a population of 20 000 clients. Each client has a traffic of 0.015 Erlangs. 24 frequencies are available and allocated to cells following a frequency reuse pattern with K = 3. Suppose that each cell uses 5 physical channels for SDCCH and common control channels. What is the number of cells needed to cover this area so that the call blocking probability does not exceed 1%?
