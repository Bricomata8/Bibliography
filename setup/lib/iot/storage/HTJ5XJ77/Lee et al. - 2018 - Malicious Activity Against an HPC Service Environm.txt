Abstract—Many researchers often use the HPC (High Performance Computing) service at KISTI via advanced high-speed network technology. In particular, the 4th Supercomputer at KISTI provides HPC services through an internet connection via 10-Gbps high-speed networks. However, there has been an increasing number of cyberattacks targeting the supercomputing services every year. In this study, based on the collected data, we show that the number of cyberattacks against KISTI supercomputing services is increasing every year. In addition, we show that this malicious activity appears to follow a power-law distribution by categorizing the source IP addresses of these attacks based on the originating country and analyzing the frequency of these attacks.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Supercomputing Service Center (KSC) at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) provides access to its facilities and services to as many as two hundred domestic and international research institutes, government agencies, universities, and companies through a variety of programs such as grand challenge and strategic research projects. Since 2009, the 4th supercomputer at the center, consisting of a cluster-type TACHYON 2 and large capacity memory-type SINBARAM, with a performance of 360 TFLOPS, has been in service [1]. In this study, to provide more secure supercomputing infrastructure and services, we collect and analyze access logs from login servers at the system level as well as security events from ﬁrewalls on the network level. Based on these analyses, if abnormal behavior is detected, we consider them as cyberattacks and accordingly deny the agents involved from accessing the supercomputer services [2]. In particular, we categorize the blocked IP addresses based on country codes and conduct probability or statistical analysis to determine the characteristics of these IP addresses. In general, the measurements made by scientists are of a typical size or scale; these individual measurements are largely based on the concepts described in [3]. In probability theory, normal distribution is the most widely known and used among all distributions; because normal distribution appropriately approximates several natural phenomena, it has developed into a standard of reference for many probability

problems. Furthermore, a random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed; such a variable is referred to as a normal deviate; for example, the heights of people and speeds of cars have found to follow normal distribution. Another representative probability distribution is the power-law distribution, which can also be observed in an extraordinarily diverse range of phenomena; for example, the populations of cities, computer ﬁle sizes, frequency of word usage in any human language, frequency of the occurrence of personal names in most cultures, number of papers scientists write, number of hits on web pages, sales of books, numbers of species in biological taxa, people’s annual incomes, and a host of other variables all have been observed to follow a powerlaw distribution [3]. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the related works about detection methods for abnormal behavior that are used for the KISTI supercomputing service environment; in addition, we brieﬂy describe the power-law distribution in Section 2 as well. In Section 3, we describe the results of our analysis regarding the probability distribution of malicious IP addresses classiﬁed based on their country code. Finally, we provide concluding remarks and directions for future work in Section 4.
II. RELATED WORKS
A. Malicious behavior detection
In order to detect abnormal behavior directed against the supercomputer, we use the following two methods. The ﬁrst method involves parsing log ﬁles of all login systems of the supercomputer [2]; in particular, the method used is proposed in [2], and involves clustering source IP address or user accounts based on failed access logs of all login systems in real-time. If the total count clustered by a source IP address or user account is over a threshold value, as indicated by Equation 1, then this IP address or user account is detected as a cyberattack source, whose access to the supercomputer is then blocked. The second method involves analyzing all events recorded by ﬁrewalls in a supercomputing service network. In general, as a ﬁrst line of defense, ﬁrewalls monitor and control irregular and malicious trafﬁc ﬂows

the from internal to external network or vice versa. In the cases of IP or Port scanning attacks, attackers try to access IP addresses or ports that are not currently serviced; these abnormal packets are then dropped by the ﬁrewall, allowing for these blocked events to be grouped by the source IP address. As in the case of the ﬁrst method described above, if the number of objects in such a ﬁrewall-based group is over a designated threshold, then the events are considered as cyberattacks. In Equation 1, ∆t is size of the time window and f (ei) is failed access logs associated with the same user account or blocked packet events associated with the same IP address. There can be multiple different T hreshold values depending on the ∆t condition.

B. Power-law distribution

A power-law is a functional relationship in which a relative change in one quantity gives rise to a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities [4]. Thus, if a distribution satisﬁes Equation 2, then it is said to follow a power-law (or heavy-tailed distribution); here, α is the exponent of the power-law, while C is a constant(in general, constant C is an uninteresting value)[3].

p(x) = Cx−α .

(2)

If plotted on a logarithmic scale, the histogram for a power-law distribution is as a straight line. Aside from those mentioned earlier, other examples of power-law distribution include the cumulative distribution of the number of times that words occur in a typical text of English or other languages, number of ”hits” received by web sites during a single day, total wealth of the richest people in the United States, size of the human population of US cities, and so on [3], [5]-[8].

III. FREQUENCY ANALYSIS OF REQUESTS FROM IP
ADDRESSES
In our study, we used the detection techniques described in the previous section to detect and block IP attacks that seemed suspicious. In particular, we applied these detection algorithms to the supercomputing service environment. Table I lists the number of denied IP address from 2013 to 2016; it is clear that the number of IP addresses that were denied access owing to abnormal activity steadily increased every year.

In order to depict the distribution of these IP addresses, ﬁrst, we converted the source IP address to a country code using an IP-to-country converter. Then, we measured the frequency of the IP address per country and plotted it on a log-log scale graph; this graph is shown in Figure 1
We compiled a ranking of countries based on the number of IP addresses that were denied from those countries. In Table II, we list the summarized results of the frequency of denied IP addresses from rank 1 to 10.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution with the frequency of denied IP addresses.
In Figure 2, the x-axis represents the number of blocked IP

addresses, while the y-axis is the cumulative distribution value from 2013 to 2016. The cumulative distribution value D(t) is inversely proportional to frequency of IP addresses t, which can be represented as follows:

D(t) ∝ t−β ,

where β = α − 1. In Figure 2, the straight lines are obtained by performing
least-square ﬁtting using Equation 4. Through ﬁtting, exponent α for the distribution is found to be 1.75 ± 0.02 ≥ α ≥ 1.94 ± 0.02 (because exponent β of cumulative plot in Figure 2 is well-known to satisfy β = α + 1 [3]). Based on our obtained results, we can conﬁrm that frequency of denied IP addresses follows a power-law distribution; furthermore, it is clear that the countries from which the most number of attacks are recorded, are becoming more aggressive as time elapses in that the number of attacks originating from these countries is steadily increasing.

D(t) = b × t−β .

The cumulative percentages of the number of denied IP addresses of the top 100 countries in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 is shown in Figure 3. Though there has been a change in the rankings of countries, it can be observed that the number of cyberattacks from each country has increased every year. In addition, more than 80% of the attacks on our system originate from the top 20 countries.

IV. CONCLUSION
In this study, we classiﬁed malicious IP addresses attacking the KISTI supercomputing services based on country code as well as analyzed the frequency of attacks. Based on our analysis results, we conﬁrmed that the frequency of attacks follow a power-law distribution. In addition, we observed that the top 20 countries in terms of the source of attacks were found to account for more than 80 percent of the attacks against our

system. Furthermore, the rate of attacks from these top ranked countries is steadily increasing every year. In the future, KISTI is going to build a 5th supercomputer with bandwidths of 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps; as the network bandwidth increases, the number of cyberattacks might steadily increase. Therefore, to enhance the security of the supercomputer, we will continue studying these attacks to better understand the frequency of attack occurrence based on country.
