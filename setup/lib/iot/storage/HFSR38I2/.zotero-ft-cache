Abstract—In this paper, we propose a feedback scheme of

a channel covariance matrix with low overhead for massive

multiple-input multiple-output systems. The proposed scheme

decomposes the channel covariance matrix into the phase and

amplitude parts. For the phase part, the element-wise uniform

scalar quantization is performed. For the amplitude part, the

following feedback information is generated: a bitmap which

denotes a sign of difference between adjacent elements, the ﬁrst

value, an increment, and a decrement. To calculate the elements

of the amplitude part, starting from the ﬁrst value, when a

bitmap is 1, the increment is added, otherwise the decrement

is added. Simulation results show that the feedback overhead of

the

proposed

scheme

can

be

signiﬁcantly

reduced

from

1 92% .

to

48 33% .

while

the

maintained with that of the conventional scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have been of great interest which can improve spectral efﬁciency [1]. However, a major challenge in realizing the massive MIMO in frequency division duplex system is how to acquire the instantaneous channel state information (ICSI) at the base station (BS) due to a large pilot and feedback overheads [1].
To acquire an ICSI, many recent works utilizing the channel covariance matrix have been investigated in spatially correlated channel [2], [3]. Moreover, instead of acquiring ICSI, transmission schemes based only on the channel covariance matrix have been studied [4], [5]. It is assumed in [2]–[5] that the BS already has a perfect knowledge of the channel covariance matrix to utilize. However, the channel covariance matrix should be fed back since it does not accurate due to a large dimension, and also can be changed over time due to the mobility of users [6]. The conventional feedback scheme of the channel covariance matrix decomposes each element into phase and amplitude parts, and performing an element-wise uniform scalar quantization [7], [8]. However, the feedback overhead signiﬁcantly increases when the number of BS antennas grows. Hence, an efﬁcient feedback scheme of the channel covariance matrix should be needed.
In this paper, an efﬁcient feedback scheme of the channel covariance matrix with low overhead for massive MIMO systems is proposed. In order to apply the proposed scheme, the channel covariance matrix is decomposed into the phase and amplitude parts. For the phase part, the element-wise uniform scalar quantization is applied. For the amplitude part, in order to reduce the feedback overhead, a bitmap which means a sign of difference between adjacent elements, the

ﬁrst value, an increment, and a decrement can be generated as the feedback information. The elements of the amplitude part can be calculated by starting from the ﬁrst value and adding the increment when a bitmap is 1 or adding the decrement otherwise. The ratio of the feedback overhead of the proposed scheme to that of the conventional scheme is veriﬁed.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system model and the conventional scheme are described. In Section III, the proposed feedback scheme for the channel covariance matrix feedback scheme with low overhead is described. Simulation results are shown in Section IV, and Section V concludes the paper.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND CONVENTIONAL SCHEME

We consider a spatially correlated massive MIMO system

consisting of a base station with M antennas and a single user

equipped with a single antenna. By the Karhunen-Lo`eve (KL)

transform, the downlink channel vector at time slot t can be

written as ht

where

CM ×r

and gt ∼ CN (0, Ir) ∈ Cr×1 denote a square root of spatial

correlation matrix with rank r and an uncorrelated Gaussian

random vector, respectively [2]. By using the one-ring model

[9], the correlation coefﬁcient between the mth and pth BS

antennas can be written as

In order to acquire the channel covariance matrix information at the BS, an approximated channel covariance matrix R¯

can be calculated at the user by using the channel vectors

side of off-diagonal elements of R¯ . Hence, for the channel covariance matrix feedback, only non-zero elements of R¯ diag and R¯ off can be quantized and fed back to the BS. For the simplicity, the case of the upper triangular matrix is considered for R¯ off in the sequel.
For the conventional feedback scheme of channel covariance
matrix, the element-wise scalar quantization is considered for the phase and amplitude parts of non-zero elements of R¯ diag and R¯ off [7], [8]. It is assumed that the elements of the phase and amplitude parts are within the interval [0, amax] and [0, 2π], respectively, where amax is the maximum value of the amplitude part. Then, a simple uniform scalar quantizer
with given bits is applied to the interval of phase and amplitude
part. Then, for given bits to quantize the phase and amplitude
parts, the total feedback overhead of the conventional scheme
can be expressed as

III. PROPOSED FEEDBACK SCHEME OF CHANNEL COVARIANCE MATRIX WITH LOW OVERHEAD
In this section, we introduce the proposed channel covariance matrix feedback scheme with low overhead. For the proposed scheme, the non-zero elements of R¯ diag and R¯ off are also decomposed into the phase and amplitude parts. For the phase part, the element-wise uniform scalar quantization is performed, which is same as the conventional scheme. For the amplitude part, however, the low overhead feedback information can be generated by the proposed scheme.

respectively. Finally, ˜cd, which is an approximated version of cd, can be calculated by using bd,(+), bd,(-), c(d1), a(+), and a(-). The kth element of ˜cd can be expressed as

c˜d(k) = c(d1) + a(+)b(dk,(−+1) ) + a(-)bd(k,(−-)1).

(5)

Using cd and ˜cd, the optimization problem is formulated as

Since the objective function of (6) is a bivariate quadratic
function of a(+) and a(-) [11], it can be arranged in descending order of a(+) and a(-) as

cd(k) − c(d1) + a(+)bd(k,(−+)1) + a(-)bd(k,(−-)1)

Since 4AB − E2 > 0 is satisﬁed by using the arithmetic-

A. Feedback Information Generation

In this subsection, we present how to generate the feedback

information. First, the feedback information of the amplitude

part of the diagonal elements can be generated by using M ×1

vector cd =∆ R¯ diag1 =

c(d1), ..., cd(M)

T
,

where

1

∈

RM ×1

denotes the all ones vector, i.e., every element is equal to

1. cd can be approximated by using the following feedback information : a bitmap bd ∈ R(M−1)×1, the ﬁrst element c(d1) ∈ R, an increment a(+) ∈ R, and a decrement a(-) ∈ R. bd denotes a sign of difference between adjacent elements.
The kth element of bd can be calculated by

bd(k) =

1, 0,

cd(k) ≥ cd(k+1) cd(k) < cd(k+1)

, 1≤k≤M −1

(3)

Then, bd,(+) and bd,(-), which denote the cumulative count of 1 and 0, respectively, can be calculated by using bd. The kth
element of bd,(+) and bd,(-) can be expressed as

k

k

bd(k,()+) =

bd(n), bd(k,()-) = k −

bd(n) ,

(4)

n=1

Next, the feedback information of the amplitude part of the off-diagonal elements can be generated by using {co,k}M k=−11 vectors that kth vector contains the kth diagonal element of R¯ diag as the ﬁrst value and non-zero elements of the kth row of R¯ off, which can be expressed as
co,k = cd(k), R¯ (okff,k+1), ..., R¯ (okff,M ) T ∈ R(M−k+1)×1, (9)

element method

in ath row and bth column of for the amplitude part of the

diagonal elements, co,k can be approximated by using bitmap bo,k ∈ R(M−k)×1, increment ao,(+),k ∈ R, and decrement ao,(-),k ∈ R for 1 ≤ k ≤ M − 1. The already generated
diagonal element can be used as the ﬁrst value. Based on (5)–

(8), the optimal a∗o,(+),k and a∗o,(-),k of kth row can be obtained. Then, an uniform scalar quantizer can be applied to the

ﬁrst value, increments, and decrements for diagonal and off-diagonal elements. Finally, the quantized scalars cˆ(d1), aˆ∗(+), aˆ∗(-), aˆ∗o,(+),1, ..., aˆ∗o,(+),M−1, aˆ∗o,(-),1, ..., aˆ∗o,(-),M−1, and bitmaps bd and bo,1, ..., bo,M−1 are fed back from the user to

the BS. The total feedback overhead of the proposed scheme

(10)

where 3Ba and M − 1 are feedback bits for 3 scalars (ﬁrst

value, increment, and decrement) and a bitmap of feedback

information of the diagonal elements, respectively. For the

feedback information of the off-diagonal elements, since there

are M − 1 rows, and 2 scalars (increment and decrement) and

a bitmap of length k are generated for kth row, 2Ba (M − 1)

and

are

needed

inﬁnity, the ratio of feedback overhead of the proposed scheme

to that of the conventional scheme can be approximated as

(11)

Since the proposed scheme approximates the amplitude part of non-zero elements of R¯ , it is important how many Ba can be used. However, although more Ba are used, it can be shown
from (11) that the ratio of feedback overheads can be reduced
when M becomes larger.

Based on the feedback information of the diagonal and
off-diagonal elements, the approximated channel covariance matrix R˜ can be reconstructed at the BS. First, the diagonal matrix R˜ diag can be reconstructed by using a bitmap bd, ﬁrst value cˆ(d1), an increment aˆ∗(+), and a decrement aˆ∗(-). The kth diagonal element of R˜ diag can be expressed as
R˜ d(kia,gk) = cˆ(d1) + aˆ∗(+)b(dk,(−+)1) + aˆ∗(-)b(dk,(−-)1), 1 ≤ k ≤ M. (12)

The off-diagonal matrix R˜ off can be reconstructed by rowwise. Using R˜ d(kia,gk) as the ﬁrst value of kth row, the element in kth row and tth column of R˜ off can be expressed as

R˜ (okff,t) =R˜ (dkia,gk) + aˆ∗o,(+),kb(dt,−(+1)),k + aˆ∗o,(-),kb(dt,−(-)1,)k,

1 ≤ k ≤ M − 1, k + 1 ≤ t ≤ M.

(13)

Finally, the reconstructed R˜ can be expressed as

R˜ = R˜ diag + R˜ off + R˜ Hoff.

(14)

Fig. 1 shows an example comparing original and recon-
structed amplitude parts of diagonal elements. In Fig. 1, the unquantized ﬁrst value c(d1), an increment a∗(+), and a decrement a∗(-) can be used to reconstruct ampltidues of diagonal elements. Based on (3) and (5)–(8), bd = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]T , c(d1) = 1, a∗(+) = 0.2185, and a∗(-) = −0.2723 can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 1, every increment and decrement of the
reconstructed amplitude parts of diagonal elements have an equal value as a∗(+) and a∗(-), respectively.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

In this section, the simulation results for evaluating the
performance of the proposed scheme are presented. For generating R, the simulation parameters in Table I are used. N is set to 50 to generate R¯ . amax = 1.2 and Bp = 3 bits are used for both the conventional and proposed schemes. For the
performance metric, we consider the mean square error (MSE)
which can be expressed as

1 MSE = M 2

R¯ − R˜ 2 ,
F

(15)

where �A�F denotes the Frobenius norm of a matrix A. Fig. 2 shows the MSE of the proposed scheme with quan-

tized and unquantized feedback information with respect to the number of BS antennas M for different Ba = 2, 3, 4, and 5. When Ba = 2, the MSE of the proposed scheme with quantized information signiﬁcantly degrades. However, when Ba increases, the MSE of the proposed scheme with quantized information can be converged to that of the proposed scheme

with unquantized one.

Fig. 3 shows the MSE and feedback overheads of the conventional and proposed schemes with respect to Ba for different M = 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. Fig. 3 also shows the ratio of feedback overheads for each M and Ba presented over the bar chart of each subplot at the right side. According to Fig.

3, it is observed that the MSE performance of the proposed

scheme can be maintained with that of the conventional

V. CONCLUSION
A feedback scheme of the channel covariance matrix feedback scheme with low overhead is proposed for massive MIMO systems. The proposed scheme decomposes the channel covariance matrix into the phase and amplitude parts. For the phase part, the element-wise uniform scalar quantization is performed. For the amplitude part, a bitmap, the ﬁrst value, an increment, and a decrement are generated as the feedback information. Starting from the ﬁrst value, when a bitmap is 1, the increment is added, otherwise the decrement is added to calculate the amplitude part. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieve a similar MSE performance of the conventional scheme with reduced feedback overhead.
