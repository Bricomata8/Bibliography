Abstract—Non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) systems are envisioned as suitable solutions for both next generation cellular and local area networks, in order to support differentiated trafﬁc requirements and a massive number of users. In this paper we consider a scenario with a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas serving four users, clustered into two groups of two users each, equipped with a single antenna. This simple but relevant scenario allows to capture the main features of NOMA systems, where in each cluster the user having the best channel applies successive interference cancellation (SIC) to remove the signal intended for the other user in the same cluster, while the other user treats interference as noise. Moreover interference among the two clusters also is treated as additional noise. In this scenario we address the problem of beamformer design and power allocation for the four users with the aim of minimizing the total transmit power while satisfying a minimum rate constraint for each user. Starting from the zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) beamformers we propose ﬁve solutions based on suitable combinations of ﬁxed beamformers to simplify the beamformer design and power allocation. The performance of the proposed solutions is compared in terms of total consumed power and complexity of the various solutions.

I. INTRODUCTION
Non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) has been shown in [1] to yield signiﬁcant gains over orthogonal multiple-access (OMA) schemes concerning overall cell throughput, cell-edge user throughput and proportional fairness. On the one hand, these results are achieved by applying successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver and superposition of multiple-user signals. In [2] the NOMA concept is extended to multiple-antennas scenarios (multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA). On the other hand, SIC still is affected by error propagation [3] and requires additional operations to decode possibly unuseful signals. In [4] it is shown that increasing the number of users in a NOMA cluster does not yield signiﬁcant gain despite increasing the computational complexity since the strongest user applies SIC multiple times.
The application of MIMO to NOMA is introduced in [2], [3] and extensively studied in [5]–[10]. A survey of singlecell NOMA is presented in [5] and the concept is expanded to a general multi-cell scenario, whose practical challenges are presented. A survey of NOMA for future radio networks is presented in [6] with its various practical implementations, such as code-domain multiplexing. The ﬁrst ergodic study of

NOMA systems is [7], where the MIMO-NOMA capacity with statistical channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) has been derived. In [8] projection-based hybrid NOMA beamforming and projection-based/inversion-based pairing under properties of quasi-degradation are introduced. A comprehensive investigation of uplink and downlink NOMA systems is carried out in [9], with emphasis on user grouping and power allocation. In [10] a scenario where the total number of user antennas is larger than the number of transmit antennas is investigated. In [11], a base station (BS) with multiple antennas transmits two data streams to two single-antenna users, where both streams are intended for the near user and only the latter for the far user; an iterative beamforming algorithm is proposed. In [12], a multiple-antenna BS serves multiple users and an effective user clustering is applied in conjunction with zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming.
Most of the considered literature focuses on ZF or maximal ratio combining (MRC) beamformers, although these solutions are far from being optimal (from the power or rate point of views) in the clustered scenario with SIC. Therefore in this paper we aim at addressing the issue of beamformer design and power allocation. We consider a scenario with a BS equipped with multiple antennas serving four users, clustered into two groups of two users each, equipped with a single antenna. Beyond cellular systems, this scenario applies also to Wi-Fi networks, e.g., implementing the IEEE 802.11ax standard [13], using a MIMO-NOMA system. This simple but relevant scenario allows to capture the fundamental features of NOMA systems, where in each cluster the user having the best channel applies SIC to remove the signal intended for the weaker user before proceeding with detection. The weaker user suffers the interference from the signal to the stronger user. Interference among the two clusters is treated as additional noise. In this scenario we address the problem of beamformer design and power allocation for the four users with the aim of minimizing the total transmit power while satisfying a minimum rate constraint for each user. Starting from the ZF and MRC beamformers we propose ﬁve solutions based on suitable combinations of ﬁxed beamformers to simplify the beamformer design and power allocation. The performance of the proposed solutions is compared in terms of total consumed power and complexity of the various solutions.
In the rest of the paper, Section II introduces the system model, while the proposed beamformers and power allocation

strategies are described in Section III. Numerical results are presented in Section IV before conclusions are drawn in Section V.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider the scenario of a BS equipped with N antennas

transmitting to four users with a single antenna each. The four

users are divided into two clusters, each with two users. In

each cluster we denote as strong the user having the highest

channel gain among the two, while the other is denoted as

weak. As usual in a NOMA scenario, signals to all users are

transmitted over the same time and frequency. The strong user

in each cluster performs SIC over the signal of the weak user

of the same cluster whereas the weak user treats the strong-

user interference as noise. Throughout this work, perfect SIC is

considered and channel state information (CSI) is considered

available at the BS. Without loss of generality, we consider

users 1 and 2 belonging to the ﬁrst cluster, with user 1 being

the strong one, while users 3 and 4 belong to the second

cluster, with user 3 being the strong one. As mention earlier,

beyond cellular systems, this scenario applies also to the IEEE

802.11ax Wi-Fi networks [13].

The BS transmits using two complex-valued beamforming vectors wn ∈ CN×1, n = 1, 2, with wn = 1, associated to cluster n so that w1 serves user 1 and 2 in cluster 1 and
w2 serves user 3 and 4 in cluster 2. The complex-valued data
signal transmitted to user i is denoted si ∈ C, and it has unitary power, zero mean and is independent of other users’

signals.

The precoded signals for both clusters are

x(1)

=

√ ( p1s1

+

√ p2s2)

w1

x(2)

=

√ ( p3s3

+

√ p4s4)

w2

(1)

and the overall precoded signal is x = x(1) + x(2). The complex-valued vector hi ∈ C1×N represents the
channel from BS to user i and the corresponding allocated
power is pi. The received signal is

y = hx + n

(2)

with h = hT1 , hT2 , hT3 , hT4 T ∈ C4×N being the channel matrix of the overall system, y ∈ C4×1 and n ∈ C4×1 the additive Gaussian noise vector with zero mean and power σ2, equal for all users.
For user 1, i.e., the strong user in the ﬁrst cluster, we have

y1

=

√ ( p1s1

+

√ p2s2)

h1w1

+

h1x(2)

+

n1

,

(3)

and after SIC (with respect to user 2) we obtain

√

√

√

y˜1 = p1s1h1w1 + ( p3s3 + p4s4) h1w2 + n1 . (4)

Instead, the weak user of each cluster treats the strong-user interference as noise; it is also needed that the strong user is able to decode the weak-user signal, through SIC, treating it as noise.

ZF beamforming: A ﬁrst option for the choice of the beamformers is the ZF beamforming, where interference among the strong-user channels is nulled. Let us consider the matrix comprising the two strong channels

hs = hT1 , hT3 T

(5)

and then construct the ZF beamforming vectors as

w = I − hHs hshHs −1 hs Λ˜ = w1T , w2T T (6)

with Λ˜ a real-positive-valued diagonal matrix to assure that wn = 1 for n = 1, 2. MRC beamforming: A second beamforming choice is the
MRC combining beamformer, aiming at maximizing the information transfer to strong users and neglecting the interference among them. In this case the beamformers are

w1 =

hH1 h1

,

w2 =

hH3 . h3

(7)

This straightforward approach is usually avoided since it leads to high inter-cluster interference.

III. PROPOSED APPROACHES
In this paper we consider the problem of power allocation to each user and the choice of the beamforming vectors, with the objective of a) guaranteeing a minimum rate to each user and b) minimize the total transmit power. In particular, let R¯i be the minimum rate required for user i, then in formulas, the constrained optimization problem can be written as follows:

(8f)

(8g)

where constraints (8b) and (8d) are for strong users, (8c) and (8e) are for weak users. The variables to be optimized are the two beamforming vectors wn and the allocated powers pi.

We ﬁrst observe that problem (8) can be simpliﬁed by replacing the minimum rate constraints with equality constraints. In fact, if we had a power p˜1 that strictly satisﬁes (8b), i.e.,

log2

1

+

σ2

+

p˜1 (p3

|h1w1|2 + p4) |h1w2|2

> R¯1

(9)

there exists a lower power p1 < p˜1 that satisﬁes (8b) at equality, thus reducing the sum power, i.e., the objective function. Besides, the choice of p1 over p˜1 would also decrease the inter-cluster interference to other users, therefore we conclude that at solution problem (8) satisﬁes the rate constraints at equality. Note that for constraints (8c) and (8e) the minimum of the two user rates achieves the equality at optimum, while the other rate can be larger than the minimum rate.
Power Allocation for Given Beamformers: For given beamformers, the optimization problem (8) boils down to the optimal power allocation that satisﬁes the rate constraints at equality. Assuming that the minimum is always satisﬁed by the weak-user channel the optimization problem becomes a linear system of four equations in the four unknowns p1, . . . , p4, as shown in (10) at the top of the page, with

(11)

If either of the strong users is achieving the minimum rate, we replace the corresponding line in the linear system with the channel of the strong user. In practice, we solve the linear system of (10) and then we compute the resulting rates for each user. If the minimum rate is not achieved by the user considered in the linear system, we solve a new linear system, otherwise we already have the global solution.
In the following we consider various options for the choice of the beamformers. Indeed, we note that the original problem (8) is in general difﬁcult to be solved since the constraints are non-convex functions in the powers as well the beamforming vectors.

A. Inter-cluster Beamforming (INTER)

The ﬁrst approach that we propose combines the ZF beamforming with the MRC with respect to the strong users. In particular, the beamformers are linear combination of the ZF and MRC beamformers, and are constructed as

w1(γ1) = w2(γ2) =

γ1h⊥3 + (1 − γ1)h1 H

γ1h⊥3 + (1 − γ1)h1

γ2h⊥1 + (1 − γ2)h3 H γ2h⊥1 + (1 − γ2)h3

,

(12)

with combining coefﬁcients 0 ≤ γ1, γ2 ≤ 1, explicitly
indicated here in the notation of the beamformers. The combining beamformer h⊥3 is the projection of h1 onto the space orthogonal to h3, i.e.,

h⊥3 = h1Π⊥h3 ,

(13)

with

Π⊥h3 = I − hH3 h3hH3 −1 h3 ,

(14)

that is the projection matrix over the null space of h3. We denote this solution as inter-cluster (INTER) beamforming as it only considers the strong users and through them the interaction among the two clusters.
Note that (12) boils down to ZF beamforming when γ1 = γ2 = 1 and to MRC beamforming when γ1 = γ2 = 0.
The choice of the beamformers now is reduced to the choice the two real positive numbers γ1 and γ2 by numerical methods.

B. Intra-cluster Beamforming (INTRA)

With the second approach we apply the ZF beamforming to equivalent channels, obtained as a convex combination of the strong and weak-user channels of each cluster. The resulting solution takes into account also the effects of beamforming design inside each cluster (by properly choosing the combination beamformer) and therefore we denote it as intracluster (INTRA) beamforming. In formulas, the two equivalent channels are

c(1)(δ1) = δ1h1 + (1 − δ1)h2 , c(2)(δ2) = δ2h3 + (1 − δ2)h4 (15)
with combining coefﬁcients to be properly chosen, 0 ≤ δ1, δ2 ≤ 1. The beamformers are designed as ZF solutions of the equivalent channels, i.e.,

w1(δ1, δ2) =

c(⊥2)H (δ1, δ2) c(⊥2)(δ1, δ2)

,

w2(δ1, δ2) =

c(⊥1)H (δ1, δ2) c(⊥1)(δ1, δ2)

(16)

with c(⊥1)(δ1, δ2) being the projection of c(2)(δ2) onto the null

space of c(1)(δ1) and, vice versa, for c(⊥2)(δ1, δ2). Again, IN-

TRA boils down to ZF beamforming by setting δ1 = δ2 = 1.

Also in this case we resort to numerical methods to optimize

δ1 and δ2.

C. Inter-intra-cluster Beamforming (TER+TRA)
In this third approach, denoted TER+TRA, we combine the previous two approaches by constructing the beamformers as a convex combination of ZF beamforming and MRC with respect to the equivalent channels, i.e.,

w1(γ1, δ1, δ2) = w2(γ2, δ1, δ2) =

γ1c(⊥2)(δ1, δ2) + (1 − γ1)c(1)(δ1) H
γ1c(⊥2)(δ1, δ2) + (1 − γ1)c(1)(δ1) γ2c(⊥1)(δ1, δ2) + (1 − γ2)c(2)(δ2) H
, γ2c(⊥1)(δ1, δ2) + (1 − γ2)c(2)(δ2)
(17)

with combining coefﬁcients 0 ≤ γ1, γ2 ≤ 1, which must be optimized by numerical methods.

D. Parallel Channels Approximation (PARA) We now consider a different approach where the beamform-
ers are not forced to be unit-norm vectors. Therefore w1 2 is the power allocated to the ﬁrst cluster and w2 2 the power

where now η1 is the portion of the power of the ﬁrst cluster allocated to the strong user, i.e., user 1, whereas 1 − η1 is the remaining portion allocated to the weak user, i.e., user 2; the same holds for η2.
Consider the unit norm vectors

u = h¯ ⊥1 =

Π⊥h1 hH3 Π⊥h1 hH3

v = h¯ ⊥3 =

Π⊥h3 hH1 Π⊥h3 hH1

,

(19)

with h¯ ⊥1 being the unit norm projection of h3 onto the null space of h1 and vice versa for h¯ ⊥3 . With these constructed vectors, we have that

h1u = h3v = 0 .

(20)

Now, we construct the beamforming vectors as a linear combination of u and v as follows

w1(α, β) = αu + βv w2(γ, δ) = γu + δv. (21)

In order to obtain a closed form solution for the beamformer

design we introduce the approximation that channels inside

clusters are parallel, i.e., h1 h2 and h3 h4, thus having also

h2u = h4v = 0 .

(22)

In Appendix A we derive a close-form expression of the optimal beamformers (i.e., optimal values of α, β, γ and δ) as a function of η1 and η2. We denote this approach as parallel (PARA) channel approximation solution.

Fixed η1 and η2 within bounds: In order to simplify the choice of η1 and η2 we ﬁrst observe that for the PARA solution we have speciﬁc bounds on these parameters, i.e.,

η1lb ≤ η1 ≤ η1ub η2lb ≤ η2 ≤ η2ub ,

(23)

where the close-form values for the bounds are derived in Appendix A. Then we can express the values of η1, η2 with respect to their bounds

η1 = k1η1lb + (1 − k1)η1ub η2 = k2η2lb + (1 − k2)η2ub (24) 0 ≤ k1, k2 ≤ 1

and choose ﬁxed values of k1 and k2. By doing this, η1 and η2 will still adapt to the changing channel conditions, but we just need to compute the bounds (23) and then use the chosen values of k1 and k2 in (24) to obtain η1 and η2. In Section IV we will optimize the ﬁxed values of k1 and k2 so that the average sum power is minimized and then we keep this values to assess the performance of the PARA system.

E. Orthogonal Strong Channels Approximation (ORTH)

A last proposed solution assumes that the strong channels are orthogonal, i.e.,

h1hH3 = 0 =⇒ uH v = 0

(25)

so that we can simplify

|h2w1|2 = α2 |h2u|2 + β2 |h2v|2 + 2αβ [h2vh∗2u∗] . (26)

As reported in Appendix B, also in this case a close-form solution for the beamformers can be obtained, as a solution of a linear system of equation. We denote this solution as orthogonal (ORTH) strong channels approximation.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
We now present numerical results for the various proposed techniques. We consider N = 2 antennas at the BS. Channels are assumed to be circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian random vectors with zero mean and independent entries. We set the same rate constraint Rs = R1 = R3 = 0.5 b/s/Hz to the strong users, i.e., users 1 and 3, and rate constraint Rw = R2 = R4 = 0.1 b/s/Hz to the weak users, i.e., users 2 and 4. We also set a constraint on the maximum instantaneous sum power Pmax = 10. Channels are generated as complex Gaussian symmetric with correlation ρ. All the proposed approaches have been numerically solved by the optimization algorithm Global Search in MATLAB, with the exception of PARA for which ﬁxed values of k1 and k2 are chosen. For comparison purposes we also consider both

ZF and MRC solutions, where powers are chosen to satisfy the rate constraints.
In particular for PARA, since the scenario is symmetric with respect to the clusters, we ﬁx k = k1 = k2 and we evaluate the average sum power with respect to the correlation coefﬁcient ρ. It is important to note that ﬁxing k means that ηn are given by (24) and the problem can be directly solved as in (30) without the need of optimization algorithms. Fig. 1 shows the average sum power as a function of k = k1 = k2 for two extreme values of the correlation coefﬁcient ρ, namely 0 and 1. Intermediate values of ρ provide an average sum power that is between those obtained with the extreme values. We can clearly see that the minimum is in the proximity of k = 1, that means taking η1, η2 near their lower bounds, therefore we set k = 0.95.
We now compare the various solutions in terms of the average sum power as a function of the correlation coefﬁcient in Fig. 2. We observe that the best performing method providing the minimum average sum power is the TER+TRA method, followed by the INTER method. The ORTH and PARA solutions still have a remarkable performance with respect to the basic ZF solution that requires the largest total average sum power. The MRC solution exhibits a strong variations among the various values of ρ. The total power is also not very sensitive to the correlation coefﬁcients, with a small decay of the total power as the correlation increases.
About complexity, we recall that the TER+TRA approach has four variables to be optimized and it involves the 4×4 matrix inversion to evaluate the objective function. Also INTER and INTRA techniques need the mentioned matrix inversion but also have 2 variables to be optimized. In any case, the INTER approach outperforms the INTRA approach; we also

recall that for values of the correlation coefﬁcient near 1 the INTRA technique is equal to the ZF on strong users and the INTER technique is equal to the TER+TRA technique.

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have proposed various techniques for the minimum sum-power allocation and beamformer design in a NOMA system with two clusters and four users, using SIC. In the various approaches the optimization of the beamformers is achieved by suitably combining simple beamformers designed to balance the interference among the clusters and within each cluster. One solution in particular does not require on-line optimization and still outperforms classical solutions based on ZF and MRC. By a comparison among the solutions we conclude that the TER+TRA solution achieves the lowest average sum-power.

We now derive the beamformers for the PARA approximation. Let us deﬁne

(27)

This approximation actually underestimates the inter-cluster interference at the weak users hence their rate constraints will not be satisﬁed precisely. This reduction in weak-user rates has to be accounted for. Let

c1 = |h1v|2 c3 = |h3u|2 , K = 2 uH v . (28)

Now for given η1 and η2, the rate constraints provide the following linear system in the four variables α2, β2, γ2, δ2

with Ai as in (11). The system solution is

In order to have real values for variables α, β, γ, δ to construct the beamforming vectors as in (21) we need the solution in (30) to be non-negative.
To summarize, for each couple of values η1 and η2 we use (30) and then beamformers (21). Again, for the choie of η1 and η2 we may resort to numerical methods.
About the bounds on η1 and η2, by imposing that real positive solutions of the system (30) we must have

(31)

It is interesting to note that the upper bounds are constant, given the users’ rate constraints, whereas the lower bounds depend on the single realization of the channels, speciﬁcally on µ1 and µ2 deﬁned in (27).
