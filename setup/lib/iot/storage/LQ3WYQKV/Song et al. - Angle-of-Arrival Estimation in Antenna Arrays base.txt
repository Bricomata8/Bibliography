Abstract—Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) estimation supports beamforming that controls array beams in a desired direction while eliminating interference signals. In this paper, we propose a blind AoA estimation method with low complexity by applying a monopulse radar processing method to an antenna array. This paper aims to investigate the statistical characteristics of monopulse signal R for the performance analysis. Monopulse signal ratio R is modeled as the ratio of quadratic random variables in the form of x Ax/x Bx, where A and B are indeﬁnite and positive semideﬁnite matrices, respectively. In this paper we obtain the probability density function (PDF) of R. Furthermore, we conﬁrm that the monopulse based AoA estimator (MAoA) is comparable to the single-target estimation performance of subspace-based algorithms with high complexity such as multiple signal classiﬁcation (MUSIC) and estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT) in terms of mean square error (MSE).

I. INTRODUCTION
Beamforming technology can be used in LTE and WLAN standards to increase coverage and improve system capacity [1]. Especially, by beamforming in the direction to localize the signal sources, it suppresses noise and interference and improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To accurately steer the beam into the direction in which the signal is incident, it is required to estimate the AoA and verify the accuracy of the estimation.
In the ﬁeld of array processing, AoA estimation has been developed over decades. The conventional beamforming such as minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) [2] has been widely employed due to its simplicity for the implementation. On the other hand, the high resolution subspacebased MUSIC and ESPRIT, which are well known so far, have been developed to attain the near optimal performance in array processing [3], [4]. These algorithms estimate AoA by singular value decomposition (SVD) or eigenvalue decomposition (EVD). Especially, MUSIC is also based on the angle spectrum that exhaustively searches the entire angle. On the other hand, ESPRIT works based on eigenspace invariance to obtain the phase difference between the antennas in the antenna array. However, both algorithms require very high computation complexity for the calculations of SVD and EVD. As the

number of antennas increases, the number of computation increases with the cube of the number of antennas, thus, the subspace-based algorithms are prohibited to be utilized in a large-scale antenna array.
To tackle the complexity problem, this paper proposes a low complexity algorithm motivated by the monopulse phase comparison method [5], which can be used in existing radar applications to the antenna array. This proposed MAoA estimates the AoA by using the phase difference between adjacent antennas in the antenna array. Here, the monopulse ratio R is used for AoA estimation which can be expressed in a form of x Ax/x Bx, consisting of a random Gaussian vector x, an indeﬁnite matrix A, and a positive semideﬁnite matrix B. Accordingly, we ﬁrst obtain the density function of R which is based on non-central Gaussian random variables and an indeﬁnite or a positive semideﬁnite matrices. Furthermore, we conﬁrm that MAoA is comparable to MUSIC and ESPRIT, which require a high computation intensity.

Fig. 1. We assume that all antenna elements are omnidirec-

tional and there is no correlation between the received signals

of the antenna elements. Then, we can write the received signal

vector as

y(t) = a(θ)s(t) + n(t),

(1)

where s(t) is the incoming pilot signal for AoA estimation and

n(t) is the complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) whose distribution follows CN (0, σ2). The array response

where λ is the wavelength of the incident signal and the antenna spacing d is half of the wavelength ,that is, λ/2 [6].
In this system, we estimate AoA based on MAoA, which is often used for monopulse radar system. Note that monopulse radar estimates AoA by obtaining amplitude or phase difference between tilted beams [5]. For the antenna array, AoA can be estimated by calculating the phase shift between adjacent antenna elements. Here, the monopulse ratio R used in the MAoA is calculated as the ratio of the sum to the difference signal between adjacent antennas. We can deﬁne the monopulse ratio R as

R

where i denotes the antenna element index and di and si denote the difference and the sum of the received signals,
respectively. The difference and the sum of the received signals are deﬁned as di = Et[yi(t) − yi+1(t)] and si = Et[yi(t) + yi+1(t)], respectively. Here, Et denotes the expectation for time and yi denotes the received signal of the i-th antenna element, namely, the i-th element of the y. For the sake of
simplicity, we here consider two antenna elements case. Then,
the monopulse ratio R can be formulated as

Since angular information is included only in the imaginary part of R, we therefore focus on the imaginary part and denote Im{R} as Rim for simplicity. The imaginary part in (5) can be re-formulated as using the random vector x,

where c is an arbitrary constant, A is an indeﬁnite matrix and B is a positive semideﬁnite matrix. To investigate the statistical properties of random variable Rim, let us ﬁnd the probability density function of Rim. Furthermore, we calculate the density function by differentiating the cumulative density function (CDF) of Rim as

IV. SIMULATIONS
In this section, we present simulation results for performance analysis of proposed MAoA. In order to identify the monopulse ratio distribution for the dual antennas case, the random variables, i.e., p, q, s, and t are generated as a histogram. We compare the theoretical value of the closed-

and

the

angular

resolution

of the MUSIC spectrum is δ = 0.05. Here, we discuss

the computational complexity among MAoA, ESPRIT [4],

and MUSIC [3]. For subspace-based algorithms, the main computational complexity comes from EVD such as O(N 3).

Accordingly, the total complexity of ESPRIT and MUSIC

are

O(N 3

+

N)

and

O(N 3

)),

respectively. On the other hand, the complexity of the MAoA

is O(n2) for n-digit numbers, which is negligible because only

scalar calculations are performed. From Fig. 3, increasing the

sample size, the SNR is reduced by 15 dB for the desired MSE = 10−3 for the MAoA. Also, as sample size increases

to 50, the performance of the MAoA comes to that of ESPRIT

in high SNR region. This is because the MAoA is more

sensitive to sample size than ESPRIT in that monopulse signal

is based on the sample mean of the sum and the difference

of the received signals, respectively, as explained in (3). By

further increasing the sample size, the performance of MAoA

will be more comparable to that of ESPSRIT. Thus, we can

conﬁrm that the performance of MAoA with much lower

complexity is nearly the same as that of ESPRIT in high

SNR region and is comparable to that of subspace-based

algorithms in low SNR region. In addition, note that for

MUSIC algorithm, an accurate comparison is difﬁcult because

simulation performance depends on angular resolution δ of the

spectrum.

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we showed the statistical analysis of monopulse signal, which is represented as the ratio of independent Gaussian quadratic random variables. We conﬁrmed that the derived PDF, of which derivation is not shown due to the limited page, is matched to the simulation results. We also compared the MSE performance among MAoA, ESPRIT, and MUSIC and found that the MSE of MAoA approaches MSE of ESPRIT in high SNR region, although the computation complexity of MAoA is much lower.
