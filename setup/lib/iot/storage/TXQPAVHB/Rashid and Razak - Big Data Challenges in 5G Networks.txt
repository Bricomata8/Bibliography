I. INTRODUCTION
Characteristics of 5G include extremely low latency, high speed data transfer and world-wide connectivity. These characteristics makes 5G agile to perform broad set of application scenarios: from high user mobility to pervasive video, from ultra-reliable to tactile Internet communication, from broadcast like services to massive internet of things (mIOT), from lifeline communications to broadband access everywhere. For enabling such diverse applications, ruthless improvements in 4G network is required: more connected devices (10-100 times), higher data rates (10-100 times), less latency (1ms), availability (99.999 %) [1], longer battery life (10 times), higher mobile data volume (1000), network management operational expenses (5 times less), energy consumption (10 times less) [2]. Field trial design and classic manual approaches are impractical due to new eco system where heterogeneous networks are expected to increase tremendously [3]. The 5G radio access and core networks need orchestration of its resources and to control the network efficiently, flexibly and with scalability, 5G networks will be based on SDN/NFV infrastructures.
Currently, during normal operations by management and control functions a huge amount of data is already generated in 4G networks and expected more to come in 5G networks due to heterogeneity in layers, diversification process and technologies, the additional management and control complexity increases in SDN and NFV architectures, due to the initiation of internet of things and machine to machine (M2M) paradigm [4]. With the advent of such technologies, increase in

variety of services and applications with different traffic patterns and quality of service/ quality of experience requirements. The time sensitive multimedia and highly bandwidth intensive services over the 5G networks bring new challenges, constraints and problems not encountered in 4G networks.
A. Potential of 5G
The functionalities and architecture of future 5G networks are expected to be agile in order to accommodate the heterogeneous requirements (latency, reliability and bandwidth) of 5G applications [5]. The expansion of the service scope of cellular networks includes a wide range of services such as mission critical machine type communication, Internet of things and mobile broadband has evolved towards 5G and beyond systems [6]. In 5G internet protocol (IP) is expected to reach about 20 Gbps per sector with ultra large content traffic. This ultra large content traffic will travel fast on the wired and wireless network. The low band spectrum is essential for various scenarios such as high mobility and seamless coverage as required in massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) and ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC). When enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) is mature it will offer data rates of up to 20 Gbps and high number of users will experience data rates of 100 Mbps [7]. To handle vertical services, with storage, connectivity and communication solutions, 5G must be transformed radically, designed for a precise digital business case of different industries (e.g. energy, automotive, health care, and multimedia). To provide services to users keeping the same cost that user is paying today is set to be a serious challenge for mobile operators and vendors. As the expected data traffic is 1000x in the coming era. Wireless industry is facing a strange challenge. It has to improve infrastructure to 1000 times, without increasing the CAPEX and OPEX [8].
Data rate requirement for various applications shown in Fig 1, are different in 5G networks. 5G support verity of use case where as demand of data rates is also variable in each scenario. Data rate requirement for smart grids for switching windmills ON/OFF and control automation is between 10 Kbps to 1.5 Mbps. For factory automation where E2E data rate requirements are 1 Mbps for smooth and efficient working. As far as intelligent transport system is concerned the data rate expected from 5G is between 10 Mbps to 700 Mbps. The reason for such a high data rate is due to its safety and high connectivity with extremely low latency. Healthcare services include tele-diagnosis, tele-surgery, tele-rehabilitation its

requirements for data rate is 100 Mbps with low latency. In near future, robots will be going a lot of jobs such as communication infrastructure, construction and maintenance in dangerous areas. So, the data rate requirements for robotics is 100 Mbps. Whereas, serious gaming, virtual reality and education and culture requirements for data rate is astonishing at 1Gbps. Extremely high data rate requirement is due to its applications in various areas and its sensitivity and high precision of the object manipulation.

Latency requirements for various applications are different in 5G networks. 5G support verity of use case where as demand of latency is also variable in each case. For factory automation where E2E latency requirements are between 0.25 ms to 10 ms for smooth and efficient working. In near future, robots will be going a lot of jobs such as communication infrastructure, construction and maintenance in dangerous areas. So, the latency requirement for robotics is 1ms. Healthcare services include tele-diagnosis, tele-surgery, telerehabilitation its requirements for latency is 1 ms to 10 ms. Latency requirement for smart grids for switching windmills ON/OFF and control automation is between 1 ms to 20 ms. As far as intelligent transport system is concerned the latency expected from 5G is between 10 ms to 100 ms. The reason for such a low latency is due to its safety and high connectivity. Serious gaming, virtual reality is at astonishing1ms. Whereas, education and culture requirements are at 5 ms to 10 ms [9].
5G provide support and offers various scenarios For Device to Device (D2D), 5G provides built-in support for D2D, ad-hoc D2D communication, deals local traffic directly and beamforming to reduce interference. For Machine to Machine (M2M) 5G can resolve time critical applications. Architecture of CRAN and SDN relaxes tight coupling of user plane and control plane. Internet of things (IoT) is proliferating exponentially. 5G offers connection density, massive data, distinct architectures, multiplexing, extended coverage area, high throughput, extremely low latency and secure. Internet of Vehicles (IoV), to accommodate time critical and to provide extremely reliable IoV 5G offers efficient traffic management through small cells for its management with dedicated links. For its computing 5G offers cloud capabilities, to distribute contents use content-centric networking with extremely low latency, efficiency and agility.

In smart cities and grid, 5G provides a much better support in terms of greater spectrum availability/efficiency, longer battery life of its nodes, highly directional antennas, high coverage area, low infrastructure cost, low latency and huge data rates.

B. Heterogeneous Demand of 5G Cellular Network
Although 5G is still being very much in development phase but it is expected to provide services as per requirement and accommodate use cases shown in Fig 2, in terms of latency, reliability and bandwidth. It is obvious that with the inclusion of machine type communication and human type communication, brings considerable differences in terms of energy consumption, traffic pattern and packet size [10]. Next generation cellular networks has to face heterogeneous characteristics of applications and unique and unknown quality of service requirements [11].

II. CHALLENGES OF 5G
A. CAPEX, OPEX and Performance Challenges
To avoid underutilization along with keeping the cost efficiency is a tradeoff to rethink, this pose a complex challenge in requirements for infrastructure capacities of 5G networks. Well-designed cost model is required to consider QoS parameters such as latency, data rate, mobility, jitter, priority, etc. Along with these parameters, cost model should account the features of backhaul and fronthaul links of the networks that can influence in cloud and core mobile network. Cost model definition should be able to distinguish between active resources in cloud and distributive mobile core. To guarantee configurability, flexibility and customization, the expected performance in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs) of 5G, there is a need investigate performance of virtualization and softwarization in 5G environments.
B. Core Network Challenges
In service based 5G core network deployment and management of network functions are still a big challenge. It is difficult to manage and balance among load and demand in congested urban areas for future 5G networks Fig 3. Management of a network is critical for reliability, service availability and resiliency of networks. For real time services dependencies of entities and network topology evolution is

153

unpredictable in network. The management system must consider the real time change in topology to identify the faulty component and to avoid incorrect and obsolete results. Latency is the undoubtedly one of the key problems to overcome in 5G scenarios. This results in exceptional challenges in terms of increasing traffic and diverse requirements of a mobile network.
• Due to the explosion of massive traffic and introduction of new radio access technologies create a bottleneck for mobile network converted to radio interface towards the core networks and backhaul.
• Machine to machine and human to machine communication needs very low data rates and significantly non-sensitive to latency but the number of interconnections is extremely high. Thus, it makes the core network suffer from signaling storm.
• Vertical industries have a huge expectation from mobile networks, such as industrial automation, autonomous driving etc. vertical industries requires low latency and extremely high reliability.
• Due to constantly altering network topologies and operating conditions, efficient methods are required to achieve stability and reliability of networks without increasing operational cost.
• It is extremely challenging to manage future complex networks, related to ultra-dense deployments, applications, heterogeneous nodes, applications, due to diverse RANs simultaneously exists in the same setting.
• To cover all the use cases and support different network software/hardware suppliers, an orchestration system flexible and efficient needs to be implemented.
• New management functionality integration with existing OSS/BSS systems.
• Need to improve energy efficiency to support 10x users and 1000x traffic.
• Need to reduce latency for better user experience by enabling Gbps speeds.
• New virtualized architectures are required to manage such diverse features of 5G.
It is difficult to manage highly dynamic networks, where service providers might not have full control of the deployment of nodes such as femto-cells deployment by end users, active antennas, fluctuating number of nodes needs energy saving policies etc. Due to the complex dependencies and magnitude of tunable parameters, the complexity and large scale of future radio access technologies enforces considerable management and operational challenges.
Complex architecture and massive amount of data travelling over a future network, big data, in urban areas. Explosion of massive data is no exemption due to a diverse range of connected devices. Big data composition will include textual content such as unstructured, structured and semi-structured, to multimedia content such as audio, video, images etc. on

multiple platforms such as sensor networks, IoT, cyberphysical systems, social media and machine to machine communications. This diverse composition is capable of generating and consuming quintillions of bytes of data. Video data is dominated among different kinds of data traffic. Video data has already offered very extensive challenges to wireless mobile networks and similarly challenges for 5G are even steeper. For a single Virtual reality traffic is expected to reach at 10 Gbps. Similarly, High Definition (HD) videos are becoming even more significant for mobile devices. With such a complex and heterogeneous data raining from any-where, any-time and any-device, is undoubtedly an era of Big Data. Control and management of such a data will be a huge task on hand. Big data can be defined as volume, variety and velocity of data that provides significant prospects for cost-effective decision making and enhance insight from extraction of information and knowledge from data [12].

As big data is growing rapidly in wireless networks, to efficient manage the wireless network big data analytics is becoming the backbone of the wireless communication.
Modern data analytics algorithms are applied to handle and extract knowledgeable insights from such a massive data source. Firstly, massive amount of data will be collected from homogenous sources, then preprocessing and using network resources will be send to data centers where various data analytic techniques such as descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics will be performed to extract meaningfull knowledge [13]. Descriptive analysis uses mainly visualization tools to get insights on of the raw data to extract, the network performance, traffic profile, mobility pattern, measure key performance indicators (KPIs) etc. Predictive analytics is a remarkable tool for making predictions. Predictive analytics can only produce forecasting about what might happen. Prescriptive analytics goes steps ahead of just predicting the future events by suggesting decision options for slicing, virtualization, edge-computing and caching, along

154

with the implications of each decision. Therefore, the prescriptive analytics need an efficient predictive model, actionable data and a feedback system for tracking down the results generated by the model. Predictive and prescriptive analytics used machine learning, data mining, and stochastic modelling are performed to extract knowledgeable data for cognition and training of next generation networks. Following are the challenges of 5G big data.

unprecedented problems such as acquisition and storage.

III. BIG DATA CHALLENGES
It is not easy to deal with big amounts of data especially if there is a certain goal in mind since data arrives in fast manner, it is crucial to provide processing speeds, sorting and fast collection of data [14]. The data distribution is about to change with time, it is challenging to process non-stationary time series data. Due to the multidimensionality, dynamicity and complexity of heterogeneous devices with diverse services and data, it is challenging to develop a computational model or framework that can collect, discover, mine, analyses and process affective data along with healthcare big data timely and with the best accuracy. The services will receive huge data volumes from large number of users and generate substantial load on the next generation networks. The process of extraction useful, valuable patterns and hidden information from big data is called big data analytics. Advanced analytics techniques are applied on large data sets to depict emerging opportunities and knowledgeable extraction of data.
A. Data Process and Management
To manage and process huge amount of data is challenging [15] in terms of designing of algorithm capable of effective and dynamic processing of resizable data and exploiting insight of data.
• Data itself i.e. data volume, variety, velocity, veracity, value.
• Process challenges: capture data, integrate data, transform data, selection of right model for analysis, provides results.
• Sensor data requires storage and analysis due to increasing volume. It is also needed to improve the response time and efficient energy consumption for better network lifetime.
• Data analytics efficiency in cost effective and green fashion.
• Cover management challenges such as security, privacy, governance and ethical aspects.
• Redundant data, generated in certain areas due to user mobility pattern, but other areas suffers from lack of resources. Hence, device management and data acquisition process are critical.
1) Data Acquisition and Warehousing is a challenge of gathering data from diverse sources and storing data. The integral complexity of Big data and due to the explosion of traffic and number of devices, bring

Fig 4: Process Challenges of Big Data
2) Data Mining and Cleansing is related to extraction and cleaning of data from big data. It has its own challenges such as identifying a better way to mine and big data cleaning can have a great value and impact.
3) Data Aggregation and Integration, once data is mined it is needed to aggregate similar data and integrate data to remove redundancy and repetitions i.e. tweets re-tweets etc. improved decision making and creating new knowledge is remains a key challenge.
4) Data Analysis and Modeling, process begun when data is acquired, stored, mined, cleaned and integrated. It is challenging to extract knowledgeable information from big data which is often unreliable, noisy, heterogeneous and dynamic in nature.
5) Data Interpretation is finding the real sense of extracted knowledge and to make appropriate decisions is performed in the process of data interpretation. It is relatively easy step like visual data representation and making data understandable to users. Fig 4 shows the process challenges of big data.
B. Bussiness Intelligence
In business intelligence network is supposed to optimize its resources and services to save its cost while providing visibility and flexibility of supply chain and resource allocation. Challenges in business intelligence are lack of sufficient resources and skilled persons, data integration complexity, privacy issue and data security, insignificant data warehouse architecture and inadequate infrastructure and synchronizing large data.
C. Complexity
Complexity of big data is a challenge in terms of correlation, connectivity of data and relationship. It can further evident in terms of multiple data hierarchies and linkages.
