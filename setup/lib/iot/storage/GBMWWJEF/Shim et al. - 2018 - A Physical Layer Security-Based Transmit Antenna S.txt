Abstract—In this paper, we propose a novel transmit antenna selection (TAS) scheme to improve the physical layer security of two-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. Speciﬁcally, the proposed TAS scheme aims to select an antenna that is the most robust against the interception of an eavesdropper, in particular, the antenna that minimizes the maximum capacity of the eavesdropper channels. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we derive an exact closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the near user and a tight approximated closed-form expression for the SOP of the far user. Numerical results reveals that the proposed TAS scheme improves the total secrecy outage probability compared to that of some existing schemes. We also provide some insightful discussions on the impact of the number of antenna and the location of the eavesdropper on the security capability of the considered system.
I. INTRODUCTION
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been conceived as a key technique in the ﬁfth generation (5G) networks to improve the spectral efﬁciency and support massive connectivity [1], [2]. Different from the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques, NOMA exploits power domain to conduct signal multiplexing. More speciﬁcally, the principle of NOMA is that a base station communicates with multiple users on the same frequency at the same time but with different power allocation coefﬁcients. Please refer to the next section for a detailed operation of NOMA transmission.
On the other hand, downlink NOMA transmissions raise some concerns about security capability since messages of multiple users are superimposed and broadcasted at the same time [3]–[5]. Speciﬁcally, if a malicious user successfully intercepts the superposed message in down link NOMA transmissions, then the malicious user overhears multiple users’ information. Thus, the security issue in NOMA systems is more important than that in conventional OMA systems. In order to deal with this issue, the authors in [4] took the advantage of spatial random deployment of both legitimate users and eavesdroppers to enhance the security of NOMA systems. Recently, in [5], the authors proposed to use artiﬁcialnoise performed by a full-duplex relay node to improve the secrecy performance of NOMA systems.
Another approach to improve the security capability of NOMA is to equip more antennas at the BS and then select the most robust one to perform NOMA. Indeed, in [6], the authors proposed a transmit antenna selection (TAS) scheme that was

able to improve physical layer security of a considered NOMA scheme.
In this paper, we propose a novel TAS scheme aiming to enhance the robustness of the two-user NOMA transmissions. The main contributions and features of the paper can be summarized as:
• Considering two-user NOMA transmission, we propose a min-max criterion to select the best antenna, which has not been reported in the literature. In particular, the selected antenna is able to minimize the maximum capacity of the eavesdropper channels, consequently, achieves better security capability.
• We develop a performance analysis in terms of secrecy outage probability (SOP). Speciﬁcally, we derive the exact closed-form expression for the SOP of the near user and the tight approximated closed-form expression for the SOP of the far user. The developed analysis is veriﬁed by Monte Carlo simulation.
• From the numerical results, we show that the proposed TAS scheme achieves better secrecy performance than some existing schemes in the middle and high regime of transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additional, as the number of the transmit antennas increases, the proposed scheme provides better secrecy outage performance than that of the other considered ones.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Let us consider a NOMA downlink transmission where a BS, denoted by S, simultaneously communicates with a cellcenter user, named User N, and a cell-edge user, called User F, by employing a two-user NOMA scheme as shown in Fig. 1. The NOMA communication is overheard by an eavesdropper, denoted by E. The BS is equipped with K antennas while each user is equipped with single antenna.
Let hiT denote the fading coefﬁcient of a channel from an antenna i, i = 1, . . . , K to a User T, where T ∈ {N, F, E}. Assuming all wireless channels in the network exhibit Rayleigh block ﬂat fading, hiT can be modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian random variables with zero-mean and variance λST. Additionally, let nT denote the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at User T, with zero-mean and variance σT2 . Thus, the channel gain |hXY|2, where X ∈ {i} and Y ∈ {N, F, E}, is an exponential random variable with probability density function

0, otherwise, i.e.,

z < 0, f|hXY|2 (z) = 0, where λXY denotes the mean of

as E[|hXY|2] = (dXY/d0)− L [7], where dXY represents the

distance between two nodes (in meters), stands for path-

loss exponent, d0 denotes the reference distance, and L is the

average signal power attenuation at d0.

Thus, the received SNR at User F to decode xF that can be

written as

Suppose that antenna i on the BS has been selected for in-

and then

broadcasted by the selected antenna at the beginning of the ﬁrst

sub-block time, where pN and pF denote the power allocation

coefﬁcients (PACs) for Users N and F, respectively. Following the principle of NOMA, we assume that |hiN|2 > |hiF|2, 0 < pN < pF, and pN + pF = 1 [8].

1) At User N: The received observation at User N can be

written as

yiN = ( pNPSxN + pFPSxF)hiN + nN.

(1)

According to the principle of NOMA, the SIC receiver at User N ﬁrst decodes xF and then subtracts this component from the received signal to detect its own message, i.e., xN
[8]. Thus, the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at User N to decode xF can be expressed as

γixNF

pFPS|hiN|2 pNPS|hiN|2 +

and the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at User N to decode xN can be written as

.

(3)

2) At User F: The received observation at User F can be expressed as

yiF = ( pNPSxN + pFPSxF)hiF + nF.

(4)

In contrast with User N, User F can directly decode its information signal since User F is allocated with higher transmit power and thus the interference introduced by the information signal of User N can be considered as noise [8].

and the SNR at E to decode xN can be written as

A. The Proposed Transmit Antenna Selection (TAS) Criteria

The proposed TAS schemes are conducted before data transmission through the signaling and channel state information (CSI) estimation/calculation system. We assume that the required CSI of each scheme is available [7], [9], [10].
The instantaneous transmission rate achieved by E associating with antenna i for xN and xF can be expressed as

CixEN = log2(1 + γixEN ),

(9)

CixEF = log2(1 + γixEF ),

(10)

respectively. It is noteworthy that the messages xN and xF are independent, and the eavesdropper aims to intercept them individually. Thus, from the perspective of the legitimate nodes, i.e., Users N and F, the potential achievable rate of the eavesdropper channel for a given antenna i can be written as

CiE = max CixEN , CixEF .

(11)

Let i∗ denote the selected antenna, the proposed TAS scheme aims to select an antenna whose eavesdropper channel is the most robust against the eavesdropper’s interception. Mathematically, the criterion of the proposed TAS scheme can be expressed as

i∗ = arg min max
1≤i≤K

CixEN , CixEF

.

(12)

The performance investigation of the the proposed TAS scheme in terms of SOP will be presented in the next section.

III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
Without loss of generality, we assume that all nodes in the system have the same noise power, i.e., σN2 = σF2 = σE2 σ2 as in [6], [9], [10]. For the sake of notational convenience, let

For the case log2

the criterion in (13) can be rewritten as

where the second equal sign in (15) happens due to the fact that

For

sake

of

notational convenience, let Xi |hiN|2, Yi |hiF|2, and

Zi |hiE|2. The following Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 help to

analyze the secrecy outage probability in the proposed NOMA

system.

Lemma 1. Suppose that |hi∗E|2 = min1≤i≤K |hiE|2. the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of |hi∗E|2 can be, respectively, written as:

F|hi∗E|2 (h)

Proof. From the (12), the CDF of |hi∗E|2 can be expressed as:

|hiE|2

(18)

since the event of |hiE|2 is independent, The F|hi∗E|2 (z) can be expressed as:

K

Fγi∗E (h) = 1 − Pr

γiE ≥ h

(19)

= 1 − (1 − Pr(γiE < h)) .

And after some algebraic manipulations, we can obtain the PDF of |hi∗E|2 as shown in (17). This completes the proof of
Lemma 1.

From the results in Lemma 1, the probability of an selected antenna in each time slot is provided in the following lemma.

Lemma 2. In a certain time slot, the probability that an selected antenna i as the best antenna i∗ can be written as:

Pr(i∗

=

.

(21)

Proof. Using the total probability theory [11] and based on the criterion in (13), the probability that a antenna is the selected antenna can be expressed as:

K

Fγi∗U (h) = Pr i∗ = i Pr γiU < h .

(22)

i=1 Ψ

where U ∈ {N, F}. From the proposed antenna selection scheme in (12), Ψ in (22) can be re-written as:

Ψ = Pr(γ1E > γiE) ∩ · · · ∩ Pr(γKE > γiE)

= Pr

K
(γjE > γiE) .

(23)

j=1,j=i

We observe that the events of probability in (23) are not mutually exclusive since each events include the common component γiE. Thus, by conditioning on γiE = h, Ψ can be further re-expressed as

∞ K−1

Ψ=

Pr(γjE > h) fγiE (h)dh

0 j=1 ∞ K−1

(24)

=

1 − Pr γjE ≤ h fγiE (h)dh.

(26)

This completes the proof of Lemma 2.

In physical layer security-based systems, the secrecy outage probability (SOP) can be deﬁned as the probability that the secrecy capacity of a user falls below a predeﬁned secrecy target rate (bps/Hz) [12].

599

1) At User N: In what follows, the SOP of User N can be expressed as

PSOP,xN = Pr Cix∗NN − Cix∗NE < Rth,xN ,

= Pr log2(1 + γ¯pNγi∗N)

− log2(1 + γ¯pNγi∗E) < Rth,xN

(27)

= Pr

1 + γ¯pNγi∗N 1 + γ¯pNγi∗E

< γth,xN

,

where Cix∗NN, Cix∗NE denote the main channel capacity and eavesdropper channel capacity for User N, respectively. Rth,xN
presents the SNR threshold for correctly decoding the message xN and γth,xN 2Rth,xN . As we can observe, the events of the
probability in (27) are not mutually exclusive because they

include the same components γi∗E. Thus, the conditioning on |hi∗E|2 = z and after some algebraic manipulation, (27) can

further expressed as

PSOP,xN =

Since the proposed antenna selection scheme selects the trans-

mit antenna to minimize the CiE, the statistical characteristic of |hi∗E|2 is presented in the Lemma 1. Additionally, The

probability that an antenna is the selected antenna is presented

at Lemma 2. Thus, the PSOP,xN can be further re-written as:

(32) is the exact closed-form expression of the near user with

2) At User F: The SOP of User F can be expressed as

PSOP,xF = Pr Cix∗FF − Cix∗FE < Rth,xF ,

= Pr log2 1 + γi∗F − log2(1 + γi∗E) < Rth,xF

= Pr

1 + γi∗F 1 + γi∗E

(33)

where Cix∗FF, Cix∗FE denote the main channel capacity and eavesdropper channel capacity for User F message, respectively.
Rth,xF presents the SNR threshold for correctly decoding the message xF, and γth,xF 2Rth,xF . (33) can be further expressed
as:

PSOP,xF = Pr γi∗F < γth,xF − 1 + γth,xF γi∗E

Since the |hi∗F|2 and |hi∗E|2 are non-negative random variables, and the statistical characteristic of |hi∗F|2 and |hi∗E|2
are given in Lemma 1, Lemma 2, respectively, after some
algebraic manipulation, (35) is can be further re-written as:

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present representative numerical results to demonstrate the achievable security capability improvement of the proposed TAS scheme. Monte-Carlo simulation results are generated to validate the developed analysis. In simulation setting, we assume that positions of the base station (S), User N, User F, and the eavesdropper (E) are randomly deployed satisfying some given distance constraints. Speciﬁcally, we set that the distance between S and User N is dSN = 10 m, the distance between S and User F is dSF = 30 m, and that the distance between S and eavesdropper is dSE = 30 m, respectively. Additional, the reference distance d0 = 1 m, and power degradation at d0 is L = 30 (dB), the path-loss exponent β = 2.7.
In order to demonstrate the performance improvement achieved by the proposed TAS scheme, we also consider some existing TAS schemes. For the sake of notational convenience, let Scheme I, Scheme II, Scheme III, and Scheme IV denote the proposed schemes, the random antenna selection scheme, and the two scheme proposed in [6], respectively, which can be detailed as follows. Schemes III and IV select an antenna that maximizes the capacity of the main channel associated with User N and User F, respectively, which can be mathematically expressed as:

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the considered TAS schemes in terms of total secrecy outage probability, which can be is mathematically deﬁned as [3]:

PSOP,Total = 1 − (1 − PSOP,xN )(1 − PSOP,xF ).

Fig. 2 illustrates the performance comparison between the four schemes, where the total SOP is plotted as a function of the transmit SNR (dBm). As can be seen, Scheme I gives the best performance at the middle and high range of the transmit SNR.

some existing TAS schemes. Additionally, the proposed TAS scheme takes more advantages than the others as the number of antenna at the BS increases. We also have pointed out that the secrecy performance of the proposed scheme becomes more vulnerable when the eavesdropper located closer to BS.

Next, we investigate the impact of the location of the eavesdropper on the the vulnerability of the system. Speciﬁcally, we consider three scenarios of the eavesdropper that is in a near zone, dSE ≤ dSN, a far zone, dSN ≤ dSE ≤ dSF, and an outer zone, dSE ≥ dSF, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the system is most vulnerable when the eavesdropper is located in the near zone while the system suffers the least inﬂuence when the eavesdropper is located in the outer zone.

In this paper, we have proposed the PHY-security-based TAS scheme, which selected the most robust antenna against the attack of the eavesdropper to the two-user NOMA system. We have derived the exact closed-form expression for the SOP of the near user and the tight approximated closedform expression for the SOP of the far user. Our results have showed that the proposed TAS scheme supports higher security capability for the NOMA system in comparison to
