Background
• C-ITS is main candidate for improving road safety, traffic efficiency and sustainable applications.
• Standardization is essential for C-ITS. • Large scale field operational test is one important step leading towards C-
ITS deployment. • I2V and V2V applications will help to stimulate the penetration rate. • New stakeholders in the value chain.

Motivation – why an European Approach for C-ITS
• Communication Interoperability:
• Standardized communication protocol is the starting point.
• Application requirements:
• Stakeholders such as C2C-CC selected a set of day 1 V2V applications. • Amsterdam Group selected a set of I2V applications. • Added value services for market introduction.
• Modular architecture:
• Support multiple applications, multiple technologies, and multiple product development strategy.
• System performance/security:
• Common minimum performance requirements and standard profiling. • Security and PKI infrastructure
• Compliance assessment:
• Standard conformance test, system compliance assessment. •…

Motivation: allocated spectrum
5,875 – 5,905 (ITSG5A) spectrum has been allocated in EU for road safety and traffic efficiency application. However, C-ITS may use other technologies such as cellular, Wi-Fi.
ITS G5 technologies: • Quick media access  low latency
broadcast/unicast communication • Ad hoc communication  no
infrastructure requirements • Allocated spectrum for ITS 
communication reliability • 200-800m communication range 
extended view for vehicle compared to RADAR, LIDAR
ITS G5 is under standardization in ETSI.
ITS G5 is considered as main candidate for road safety applications by European C2C-CC

Applications

• “Information and awareness” application : • Road hazard signaling applications based on G5. • Traffic efficiency applications based on G5 or existing technologies.

• Application requirements: • Mainly focused on transmitting vehicle • When and how to transmit information to others. • What information to be transmitted. • Requirements on communication and security.

• Technology agnostic, but application requirements may result in specific choice of

technologies:

• Reliability

• Communication coverage

• Latency

Source: ETSI

• Interoperability

Networking and transport layer
• Basic transport protocol: BTP in ITS ad hoc network • BTP-A for interactive packet transport; and • BTP-B for non-interactive packet transport (used for CAM, DENM).
• GeoNetworking: • Packet dissemination with geographical position • Multi addressing mode: geobroadcast, geounist, geoanycast. • Multihop support: • Basic greedy forwarding and advanced forwarding scheme • Forwarding node selection based on distance and time factor. • Store and forward for low density network. • Location service: beaconing, location service and location table. • Media dependent functionalities based on estimated data traffic volume: • Interval control, range control.
• ENs are close to finalization.

TPEG

Facilities layer: Cooperative Awareness
• Facilities layer core message, independent to application • High frequency update of vehicle position and status. • Possibility for further extension (e.g. RSU).
• 1-10Hz transmission • Generation rules based on vehicle mobility (speed, distance, acceleration, drive heading change) • Consider the potential packet lost. • Interaction with congestion control mechanism
• Support multiple vehicle types, including public transport, safety car, truck with dangerous goods.
• Strong collaboration between ETSI and SAE BSM. • Compact message size to adapt to ITS G5 transmission. • EN document approved by ETSI, public enquiry is about to start.
