I. INTRODUCTION
Internet of Things (loT) has been initiated from enabling connectivity on edge devices, and providing new services which have not been available with reasonable cost. Key challenges in the realization of loT systems and applications are to minimize edge nodes deployment cost and maintenance cost. It is because the number of required edge nodes is much higher than that of hand-held devices. Wireless communication protocols, which are specially designed for loT applications, can minimize the hardware complexity and power consumption of edge nodes. Furthermore, cloud technology providing the common service frameworks can reduce maintenance cost of loT systems. Fig.l shows the place of LPWAN in loT wireless connectivity ecosystem whilst Fig. 2 demonstrates the block diagram of a low-power long-range transceiver module SXI276/77/78/79, operating at 137 MHz to 1020 MHz [1]. In accordance to possible communication ranges, two wireless �ommunication protocols can be classified into two categories, I.e. (i) short-range and (ii) long-range communication protocols. On the one hand, WiFi, Zigbee, and Bluetooth represent the short-range communication protocols, which are suitable for indoor environments. On the other hand, long­ range communication protocols can be deployed using LoRa communications [2-4]. Typically, LoRaWAN has three classes

of end-point devices to address different needs reflected in wide range of applications as follows;
First, class A or a bi-directional end-device in which end­ devices allow for bi-directional communications whereby each end-device uplink transmission is followed by two-short downlink receives windows. This class A operation is the lowest power end-device system for applications that require downlink communication from the server shortly after the end­ device has sent an uplink transmission. Second, class B or a bi­ directional end-device with scheduled receive slots. Such a class B device opens extra receive windows at scheduled times. In order for the end-device to open receive window at the scheduled time it receives a time synchronized Beacon from the gateway. This allows the server to know when the end­ device is listening. Last, class C or a bi-directional end-device with maximal receive slots in which end-devices have nearly continuously open receive windows, only closed when transmitting [5].

The proposed system employs four gateways with bridge-to­ bridge WIFI connection for communication to the server. The end node can be integrated more than ten types of sensors such as GPS, Temperature, Humidity, and water sensors. All data can be visualized real-time via monitor station. The proposed system provides not only an emerging long-range communication but also low-power operation in a military campsite within 1.5 kilometers.

Mohamed Are! and Axel Sikora [6] presented a short overview on the technologies to support Long Range (LoRaTM), and described the outdoor setup at the Laboratory Embedded Systems and Communication Electronics of Offenburg University of Applied Sciences. It was found that the range directly depends on the link budget, which can be increased by the choice of modulation and coding schemes. The SX127x family from Semtech Corp. is a member of this device class and promises significant benefits for range, robust performance, and battery lifetime compared to competing technologies. Juha Petajajarvi at al., [7] studied the coverage of the LoRa LPWAN technology through real measurements. The experiments were conducted in the city of Oulu, Finland, using commercially available equipment. The measurements were executed for cases when a node located on ground or on water reporting their data to a base station. The node operate in the frequency range of 868 MHz ISM band using 14 dBm transmitting power and the maximum spreading factor. The maximwn communication range was found over 15 km. on ground and close to 30 km. on water.
Recently, Thomas Wendt et aI., [8] employed EM Microelectronic developed a LoRanLmodulation chip called EM9101 for the 2.45 GHz frequency band, which is based on the Semtech technology. This transceiver-modern-design offers an ultra-long range spread spectrwn communication and high interference robustness. The spread-spectrwn technology is not new, but implemented into a 2.45 GHz frequency based chip which can be taken as add on modem to a standard transceiver chip. The gain for the air-link budget which is more than 20 dBm can be utilized to obtain a huge communication distance. This paper therefore presents the long-range communication system that comprises not only the implemented gateway using Raspberry-Pi but also an end-device using microcontroller with GPS and other sensors for geological and physical tracking.

II. PROPOSED U-LoRA END-NoDES AND GATEWAY
A. U-LoRa End-Node
The proposed Universal LoRa End Node so called "U­ LoRa" has been designed as a stand lone device, which can be equipped with other microcontroller. Fig.3 shows the block diagram of the proposed Universal LoRA End-Node with GPS Module. It can be seen from Fig.2 that the end-node comprises a LoRa Module with an antenna operating at 2-dBi and 433 MHz Whip Antenna. The LoRa module is connected to the Arduino Pro-Mini that processes all signals both inputs and outputs. The GPS Module is Ublox neo-6m. The power supply system is a Lithium-Ion Batter (3.7V) that supplies Lithiwn­ Ion Battery Charger Module TP4056. Such a module TP4056 supplies 5V for Arduino Pro-Mini as well as a step-down voltage regulator module of 3.3V for LoRa module.
B. U-LoRa Gateway
Fig. 4 shows the block diagram of the proposed Universal LoRa Gateway connecting to a computer. The computer is connected to the Raspberry Pi controller as a main microprocessor, which connects to the LoRa Module via SPI. As a main station, the AC/DC Adaptor (12V, 2A) has been exploited for a voltage regulator (12V to 5V).
III. PROPOSED TACTICAL TROOPS TRACKING SYSTEMS
Fig.4 shows the architecture of the proposed tactical troop tracking system. It is seen in Fig.5 that a single U-LoRa gateway is exploited in the center of an investigation area. The U-LoRA End-Nodes can be as much as preferred, but there are six nodes demonstrating in this system. All the end-nodes are connected to the LoRa gateway before transmitting to the Layer2 network switch under loT and web server. All the data will be transferred to the network before visualizing on the graphic user interface. The system can be extended to a wider range area within 5x5 kilometers as shown in Fig.6. The systems can be expanded to the tactical troop tracking system with a four gateway with four point-to-point Wi-Fi bridges. Such a system could provide wider coverage. It should be noted that the gateway should be in an appropriate height in order to be capable of receiving signals from each end-nodes, and the electrical surge system should be considered and integrated in order to protect from any possible failures.
IV. IMPLEMENTATIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The proposed system has been implemented using commercially available devices. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) show the implemented end-node and gateway, respectively. Such devices are a very first implementation in Thailand.

Perfonnance analysis has been tested at Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology where the gateway was installed at the 6th floor of C-building with a height of 500 meters. The coverage range has been incremented by 100 meters with actual obstacles as depicted in Fig.8. The performances were investigated by received signal strength indicator (RSSI), which is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. It should be noted that RSSI is usually expressed in dBm from 0 to approximately lowest at -120 dBm. In addition, Signal-to­ Noise Ratio (SNR) has also been investigated and is defined as the ratio of signal power to the noise power expressed as

SNR= Ps

(1)

PN

where Ps is a signal power while PN is a noise power. Such SNR is a defining factor in order to measure the quality of signal in communication channels. Typically, a higher value of SNR guarantees the clear acquisitions with low distortions and artifacts caused by noises. The better value of SNR causes the better signal strength, resulting in the better quality of transmitted signals. Fig. 9 also shows he trajectory of LoRa test.

In this work, the received signals are the Latitude and Longitude obtained from the GPS module. Fig. 10 plots the measured RSSI in dBm versus a distance in meter. It can be seen in Fig.1O that the RSSI decreases from 0 to -90 dBm within 100 meters. The values are in the region of -90 dBm to approximately -100 dBm within the distance of 100 meters to 500 meters before the signal was lost. Fig.l l plots the measured SNR in dB versus a distance in meter. It is apparent that the SNR is positive till the distance of around 160 meters.

It can be considered from Figs. 9 and lO that the implemented U-LoRa devices both end-node and gateway have been operating very effectively with long distance of 500 meters using only an antenna power of 4 dBi at 433MHz. For an applications in longer distance, the antenna power can be increased depends upon the application requirements. Moreover, military application can exploit other possible frequency channels with a closed wireless network through extranet.
