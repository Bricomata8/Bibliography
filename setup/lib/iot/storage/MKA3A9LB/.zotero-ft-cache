I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays, small drone demands for consumer and commercial market are rapidly increased. Specially, multicopters for hobby and photographing are used familiarly to common people and considered to a toy and private camera. But the technology of drone for public service and commercial usage still must be developed for ensuring the safety, security and special mission. In Korea, considering the increasing commercial and public usage, small drone development project for public innovative procurement was launched on September, 2016, and will be advanced to 2019 for three years. Through the project, small drone companies are achievable to acquire initial market as well as technology advancement. Particularly, the R&D program of MSIT actively supports the technical development and the initial public market creation for small drone company according to the agreement between the Ministry Science and ICT (MSIT) and the Public Procurement Service (PPS). In the first year (2016), 6 projects were selected among 35 demands proposed from various government offices and support agencies. And in the last year, 3 projects were promoted among 29 demands. In this paper, I introduced the Korean PPI process [3] relating to small drone development in Korea, and explained the status and results acquired for two years.

II. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
For drone R&D program relating to public innovative procurement, the first starting step is to gather the public demand and form a critical mass of purchasing power from the public organization side. In the first year (2016), 35 demands were submitted from various government offices and support agencies, and MSIT selected 6 projects considering technical innovation and possibility. In the second year, 3 projects were promoted among 29 demands. After selection, RFPs are generated from needs of each project including the required functionality, performance and price requirements. And also procurers express the intention to buy a mass of innovative products if the company can bring them to the public procurement market with the predefined price and quality requirements.
The second step is to select the final developing company with the presentation and field test evaluation. After the first competition is carried out through the document review and presentation evaluations, plural companies are selected for competitive dialogue and field test evaluation. And two or three months later with supported small budget, the second competition is performed through the field-test evaluation. In addition, during this period, the final RFP and adaptable technology level are determined through the competitive dialogue about technical challenge and price competitiveness. The field test evaluation is described in detail in the next chapter.
The third step is the stage of development based on the final RFP determined in the second step. In this stage, customers wish to validate their requirement and perform conformity assessment with the product of developer that can meet their needs, before actually procuring. Therefore, we conduct monthly progress review meeting with customer, developer together. We try to make continuous dialogue for the technical solution of additional requests or technical hurdles during development phase.
Not only the verification test to meet their requirements, but also the field operational test are performed to confirm the performance, safety and suitability of the customer’s mission environment. Finally, when all assessments are completed, developing companies apply the certification of an excellent procurement products.

The final step is for certification of excellent procurement product. Excellent procurement is the process by which private contract is available to enable the rapid procurement of innovative products. Once registered, certifications are maintained for three years to reflect innovative characteristics. This process is a system already promoted by the Public Procurement Service. We plan to register the small drones developed in this project as excellent procurement products by this procedure and to help the public organizations purchase from time to time when the budget is secured.

III. FIELD-BASED TEST EVALUATION
In order to select final developers, we performed fieldbased test evaluations every times in the Goheung Aviation Center, Yeongwol and Busan. The main purpose of evaluation is confirm the flyable platform and the ability to perform the required mission. The evaluation items are fly in place, automatic takeoff and landing, cope with an emergency, mission flight, safety flight, operational convenience, etc.
Finally, 9 companies were selected for each mission. (6 companies in 2016, 3 companies in 2017) listed in Table I.

A. Searching a Missing Person
In order to search and rescue a missing person the quicker is the better. Therefore, AI drones are a good solution. For this purpose, high resolution EO/IR camera (max. payload 2kg) is installed and deep learning for real-time recognition is used to analyze and detect a missing person automatically.
Considering that it is operated under extreme conditions, several safety options are also adapted: parachute, collision avoidance, geo-fence, return-to-home, auto-landing, etc.

B. Real-time Weather Observation
Usually, in order to obtain the atmospheric data for weather observation, small balloon (radio-sonde) is employed. But not only the cost of disposable balloon, but the station keeping problem is a big burden for observation. Small drones installed on-board weather sensors are proposed to observe data: wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure, etc.

E. Surveillance of red tide and marine contamination
Korea is surrounded by sea on three sides. Therefore, the surveillance of red tide and marine contamination is an important role of the office of ocean and fisheries. For this purpose, hybrid UAV system that can do vertical takeoff and landing, hovering and fixed-wing flight is developed equipped with multi-spectral sensor, and the required flight time is over one hour and the operating radius is over 15 km.

D. Maintenance of Marine Navigational Beacon
In the coastal region, there are visual aids to support the marine navigation through the marking their location with lights at night: light house, light pole, beacon, light float, etc. Because visual aids to navigation should be sufficiently seen within the required range, marine officials must check and maintain their lights every night.
Small UAV with IR and night-vision camera can perform the maintenance instead of human very quickly. But it needs technical solution to 20 km flight over the coast in the night, and furthermore it must be able to detect and check the lights automatically.

G. High-speed Racing Drone and Video Transmission
As the interest of small drones increases, many drone racing competitions are being held. But with the little drones, it is hard for people to chase them with their eyes, and there are some difficulties with shooting with broadcasting cameras. For this purpose, a large scale racing drone (1,000+mm) capable of flying at a speed of more than 160 km/h is being developed. It is being developed as a system capable of transmitting Full HD broadcast video with a delay of less than 1 second.
For the safety during the racing, geo-fence, return-to-home, auto-landing technology will be adapted in this racing drone.

H. Detecting harmful air pollutants in emission gas
Many harmful pollutants are emitted from the chimneys in the industrial complex. Although the government oversees and controls them, it is difficult to collect and enforce pollutants quickly if people are directly involved in crackdowns. For this purpose, a small UAV equipped with a hyper-spectral camera needs to be operated for real-time air pollution scanning, and a system capable of collecting samples simultaneously when pollutant discharge is confirmed is being developed.

I. Water-area Management and Oceanographic Survey
Although maritime surveys using ships have been carried out, there is a disadvantage that the operation cost is expensive due to the use of vessels equipped with high-priced equipment. Furthermore, in coastal areas, there are many reefs and obstacles, which makes it difficult to survey, it needs innovative solution for low cost unmanned operation.
Last project of our program is the UMV system development for the oceanographic survey and investigation using unmanned surface vehicle (USV) operated with remotely operated vehicle (ROV).
