its capability of frequency selectivity, cyclic prefix (CP) and robustness to carrier frequency offset (CFO). In spite of these advantages, many researchers have claimed pros and cons for the usage of FBMC, among those the excessive computational complexity is considered as a major hurdle to deploy for direct employment. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) performance through computer simulation to verify the validity of the proposed method.

Significant preponderant capability on the usage of WOLA originates on the flexibility of determining the number of subbands M and decimation factor K . Precisely, according to many related works, the WOLA does not necessitate any restriction on the relationship between M and K , whereas the PPFB does. This positive characteristic enables to adjust the ratio between M and K freely. Thus, this degree of freedom can

Specifically, (5) reflects the overall OQAM-FBMC waveform achieved via carrying out a series of a block-wise procedure consisting of a series of shifting & windowing operations. Here, after the construction of temporally aligned NS  2Q 1 blocks, the windowing operation carries out by multiplying a series of concatenated blocks, namely the temporally shifted IR of PF of length L , in which each block consists of the length- K outputs.

To represent the above shifting & windowing operation in mathematical derivations, define the   th block of the overall OQAM-FBMC waveform as u() , then we can represent the resulted waveform in the form of the summation of block-wise multiplications as the following ;

B. Proposed WOLA based OQAM-FBMC Receiver For taking a step forward via exploiting the structure for OQAM-FBMC receiver based on the proposed WOLA, this subsection begins with reviewing two types of conventional receiver discriminated as in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. The difference between two types of receivers originates from the location of the delay operator Z whether if the subband index m is even or odd. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, ‘REAL’ and ‘IMAG’ indicate the operators to extract real and imaginary part separately from complex input sample so that the corresponding outputs become real. Moreover, it can apply the angle

factors to make real-valued input samples into pure-real or pure-imaginary in an interlaced order by which it can recover OQAM encoded symbol sequence xˆm (n) .
