Abstract— Due to recent abrupt climate change and the environmental contamination, the interest in the renewable energy increases, and various types of renewable energy generation systems have been replacing the existing old ones using fossil fuels. Hydroelectric power generation is traditionally one of those clean energy solutions. Recently, new hydroelectric power generation from municipal water systems has been developed and regarded as a new or replaceable water system of new and old cities. In this paper, basic architecture of hydroelectric power generation from water pipes and information modeling is proposed in terms of management.

I. INTRODUCTION
Municipal water systems carry large amount of water through underground pipes. It was uneconomic and impractical to put hydroelectric generators in pipes to generate electricity by using the water flow energy because it definitely takes energy away from the water flow and finally requires more electricity to operate more powerful pumps to move the water from the source to customers. However, it becomes possible to generate electricity in case that water flows naturally from a high elevation.
In case of the Korean peninsula having seas on three sides, aqua farms are well developed and equip with water pumps which raise water from the sea. The raised sea water, through the aqua farm, flows to the sea from a higher elevation. Our hydroelectric power generation system is designed to use that water flow energy and converts it to electricity.
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
A. Waterflow-based Hydroelectric Power Generation System
The proposed architecture of waterflow-based hydroelectric power generation system is illustrated in Fig.1. In order to get energy from water flow, one or more hydraulic turbine(s) are located in (a) water pipe(s) by taking into account of the target electricity generation as well as the geographical and physical conditions such as velocity and flux of water flow in pipes, diameter of pipes, and etc. which consequently affects the design parameters for both of hydraulic turbines and gearboxes.

Fig. 1. Waterflow-based Hydroelectric Power Generation System
The gearbox consists of gears and gear trains to provide constant speed and torque conversion from a rotating hydraulic turbine to a generator in order to generate steady electricity. The generator converts the rotational kinetic energy into electric energy, which is usually AC power. The generated electricity can be sent to either electrical power system or Electricity Storage System (ESS) through a Power Conversion System (PCS).
For the management and control of each main component of the system, a waterflow-based hydropower plant management system (WF-HPMS) client is located at a local site or a waterflow-based hydropower plant. The WF-HPMS client gathers operating status values of each component and forwards them to the WF-HPMS server on a periodic basis or upon a request from the WF-HPMS server according to the characteristics of the gathered values. RS-485 is designated as the network interface between WF-HPMS client and each component by considering environmental characteristics of the power plant.
The WF-HPMS server, through 3G, 4G or 5G network, connects several WF-HPMS clients located at geographically remote areas as shown Fig. 2. The main function of the WFHPMS server is to monitor the electricity generation in realtime and to diagnose fault or breakdown of a component of a local site.

B. Distributed Energy Resource
The WF-HPMS server and WF-HPMS clients can be grouped as represented on the left side of Fig. 2, and logically regarded as a power plant so called Distributed Energy Resource (DER) even though the physical power generation occurs independently at remote areas.
C. DER for Virtual Power Plant
The waterflow-based hydropower plant as one of DERs can be connected to a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) with other DERs such as solar power plant, wind power plant and so on as depicted on the right side of Fig. 2. A VPP is a cloud-based distributed power plant aggregating heterogeneous DERs for the purposes of enhancing electricity generation.
III. INFORMATION MODELING
For the information modeling of the waterflow-based hydropower plant, the international standard, IEC 61850-7-410 [1] and IEC 61850-7-420[2] are utilized. The former specifies the additional common data classes, logical nodes and data objects required for the use of IEC 61850 in a hydropower plant. The latter defines IEC 61850 information models to be used in the exchange of information with DERs, which comprise dispersed generation devices and dispersed storage devices including reciprocating engines, fuel cells, microturbines, photovoltaics, combined heat and power, and energy storage. It also utilizes existing IEC 61850-7-4[3] logical nodes where possible, but also defines DER-specific logical nodes where needed.
A. Logical Devices and Logical Nodes for WF-HPMS Client
The proposed waterflow-based hydropower generation system in Fig. 1 is modelled as illustrated in Fig. 3 by use of IEC 61850-7-420 and IEC 61850-7-4. Logical Nodes (LNs) associated with each physical component are summarized in Table. I.

C. Data Objects and Common Data Classes for Generator, Power Conversion System and Meter
Since the data objects and common data classes for a generator, a power conversion system and meters required for information modeling are usually similar to all of DERs using renewable energy such as photovoltaic systems, fuel cells and energy storages, detailed information is omitted.
D. Data Objects and Common Data Classes for WF-HPMS Client
Main functions of the WF-HPMS client are to monitor the operating status of all sub-components at the local site by measuring metered values, to exchange those information with a WF-HPMS server, and to control sub-components according to commands sent from the WF-HPMS server. In order to provide those functionalities, logical nodes including DRCT, DRCS, DRCC, MMXU, and CSWI are utilized as summarized in Table III.
IV. OPERATIONAL SCENARIO
For the operation of waterflow-based hydropower plant, scenarios such as initiation, test mode, start, monitoring (or diagnosis), stop and load control are defined as represented in Fig. 4. Though information modeling of all sub-components is designed according to the international standards as explained in Section III, only WF-HPMS clients act as an intelligent electronic device (IED) specified in IEC 61850-7-1 and exchange information with one WF-HPMS server due to the constraints of physical network interfaces (i.e., RS-485) between a WF-HPMS client and sub-components, which is usually caused by environmental constraints of the plant and the consideration of cost-effective network method for the installation of sub-components.
The interconnection between a WF-HPMS server and clients uses 3G-, 4G, or 5G-based wireless network. The WFHPMS server will be implemented to provide GUI-based control functions of each remote plant for operators as well as operational status monitoring services for normal users.
