Abstract—In this paper, we study the precoder design with an energy efficiency (EE) criterion for a full-duplex (FD) multiantenna cellular system. Unlike the half-duplex (HD) cellular systems, the extra residual self-interference (RSI) and the cochannel interference (CCI) are involved in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) received signals due to the simultaneous transmission and reception in an FD base station (BS). Accordingly, we aim at developing the UL and DL precoders to suppress the influence of the RSI and CCI, where the EE criterion is adopted to reach the goal of the green communication. However, the EE precoder design is a fractional non-convex problem. To find the tractable solution, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) method to conduct the DL and UL precoders iteratively. For given DL precoders, the closed-form solution of UL precoders can be eventually yielded by an iterative water-filling (IWF) procedure. Nevertheless, the similar method cannot directly be applied to optimize the DL precoders. We then resort to the UL-DL duality that transfers the DL precoder design to an equivalent UL precoder design problem. We further apply the primal-dual decomposition to the DL precoder design and solve it by the IWF algorithm. Finally, the performance of the proposed design is verified by computer simulations and the result shows its superiority over the existing design.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, the full-duplex (FD) transmission is developed to improve the spectrum efficiency. The FD system potentially doubles the spectral efficiency (SE) compared with the conventional half-duplex (HD) system by simultaneous transmission and reception. Nevertheless, it incurs the selfinterference (SI) due to the nature of the FD system. Though several passive and active techniques have been developed to cancel/suppress the SI, the residual SI (RSI) still exists and degrades the overall performance [1]. Therefore, it is really crucial to design an approach to further suppress the RSI.
For a multi-user (MU) MIMO FD system, the SE can naturally be enhanced by the benefits of multiple antennas and FD techniques [2]. The RSI can be further mitigated with the precoding schemes [2], [3].
In addition to the SE design, the energy consumption is also an important issue due to the fact that the number of communication terminals is significantly growing. The energy efficiency (EE) design becomes critical and is studied in various kind of wireless communication structures [4]-[7].

Instead of maximizing the SE of a system directly, the EE design aims at maximizing the SE per joule.
In [5], the scheduling and power allocation strategy was proposed to maximize EE. The EE design was also studied in cognitive communications [6]. In [7], the authors devised the downlink (DL) precoder with an EE criterion in a HD MUMISO system.
The precoder design with SE and EE criteria in a FD MUMIMO system was first studied in [2]. Comparing with the precoder design in a HD system, the UL signal is subject to the RSI resulted from the DL signal at the FD BS, and the DL users are interfered by the UL users, where the interference is also referred to as the co-channel interference (CCI). To provide a tractable solution, the authors in [2] assumed the DL users are not interfered by the UL users, i.e., the CCI is ignored. Moreover, only the lower bounded objective was adopted in the precoder design with an EE criterion. As a result, the considered scenario is not complete.
To fill up the gap, we consider a more practical FD MUMIMO system which concurrently suffers from the RSI and CCI. At the BS, we adopt the minimum mean-squared error successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) receiver to recovery the signals of the UL users and use the dirty paper coding (DPC) transmitter for the DL users. To further suppress the RSI and CCI, we propose to jointly optimize the UL and DL precoders with an EE criterion, where the total sum rate per consumed energy is maximized under the restricted power constraints. However, the corresponding optimization problem is a fractional non-convex problem. The optimum solution is not tractable under the limited hardware complexity. Accordingly, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) approach for the precoder design, where the UL precoders are optimized with the given DL precoders and vice versa. When the DL precoders are given, the problem becomes a tractable fractional programing, and the solution can be conducted by Dinkelbach’s algorithm [8]. Particularly, the closed-form solution of the UL precoders can be derived by the proposed iterative water-filling (IWF) algorithm. However, owing to the coupled precoders in the objective and the constraints, the IWF cannot be directly applied to conduct the DL precoders.
To overcome this difficulty, we resort to the DL-UL duality to transfer the DL problem to a UL formulation [9]. However, the IWF algorithm cannot be directly used to derive the optimum solution. In this regard, we apply the primal-dual

decomposition to decouple the coupled power constraint [11].

Consequently, the optimum DL precoders can be conducted

with the IWF algorithm in the primal problem.

difficult to find the optimum solution.

B. Proposed Design
To find the tractable solution, we resort to Dinkelbach’s algorithm to solve the fractional problem [8]. Particularly, Dinkelbach’s algorithm can optimally solve a concave-convex fractional problem. Though the considered problem is not concave-convex fractional formulation, we can still apply it to yield a suboptimum solution.

The IWF algorithm can optimally derive the UL transmit covariance matrices when optimizing the UL spectral efficiency in a HD-BS MU MIMO system [10]. Furthermore, with the help of the uplink-downlink (UL-DL) duality, the IWF algorithm can also be applied to conduct the DL transmit covariance matrices. By this concept, we are able to reformulate the DL transmission as the equivalent UL transmission in the FD scenario.

To conduct UL-DL duality, we first rewrite the DL signal for the ith user as

yDi = HDi xDi + nDi ,

Now, we can apply Dinkelbach’s algorithm to solve the

problem of (15). The basic idea of Dinkelbach’s algorithm is to

transform (15) to an another form by introducing a non-

negative scalar λ , then optimizes it and iteratively updates λ .

Specifically, by introducing the non-negative scalar λ , we

define the following lambda-related problem:

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The performance of the proposed energy efficiency design is

compared with that of [2] in a FD MU-MIMO system. Unless

otherwise mentioned, the each element of uplink channel

H U i is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) circularly complex Gaussian random variable with zero

mean and unit variance. The same definition is applied for

( ) ( ) H Di

entry of GS and G , respectively. For

Di Uj

follows

simplicity,

we consider two users for each link direction (UL and DL) and

each user is equipped with two antennas, i.e., KD = KU = 2, and

ND1 = ND1 = NU1 = NU2 = 2. The BS has 8 antennas (M =
{ } 8). Moreover, the initial values of Q(D0i) are selected as
identity matrices. The noise power at the BS and the DL

channel is set to be unity. We also let PUi =0.7 PD. The dynamic circuit power is set to PDDyn = 38 dBm and PDSta = 27
dBm. The error tolerance for conducting the iteration process

is set to 10-6.

In Fig. 2, we investigate the EE and SE designs in [2] and

the proposed design for different values of PDTx. In this

simulation, we let PU j

and

σ

= -20

dBm. As shown in this figure, the performance of the SE

design in [2] is close to that of the proposed EE design, while

the gap becomes significant as PD increases. The reason

follows that the higher SI power is, the lower SINR can be

achieved for the UL users. In this case, the UL users prefer to

save power to reach a higher EE performance. The result

corresponds to the deviation of Eq. (24). The proposed method

outperforms the EE design in [2] due to the fact that [2]

essentially optimizes a lower bound of EE, while the proposed

method uses the exact EE value for optimization, achieving a

better result.

V. CONCLUSIONS
This paper studies the UL and DL precoder design to suppress
the influence of the RSI and CCI for a FD multi-antenna
cellular system. We first propose the AO approach which
solves the UL precoders with given DL precoders, and vice
versa. Then we apply Dinkelbach’s algorithm to sequentially
optimize the UL precoders, and the closed-from solutions are
obtained by the IWF algorithm. For the DL precoders, we
apply the UL-DL duality and the primal and dual
decomposition so that the coupled objective and constraints
are decoupled. The closed-form solution of the DL precoders
is finally yielded. Simulation results show that the proposed
design outperforms the exiting methods.
