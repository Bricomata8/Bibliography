Abstract—In this paper, we study how to improve physical layer security capability of multiple near users and multiple far users non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. To this end, we propose an opportunistic user scheduling scheme, named the best-secure-near-user best-secure-far-user (BSNBSF) scheme. The BSNBSF aims to select the best near-far user pair, whose data transmission is the most robust against the interception of an eavesdropper. In order to facilitate the performance analysis of the proposed user scheduling scheme in terms of secrecy outage probability (SOP), we derive an exact closed-form expression and a tight approximate closed-form expression for the SOP of the selected near and far users, respectively. Numerical results show that the BSNBSF scheme signiﬁcantly improves the secrecy outage performance NOMA networks compared to that of the random near user and random far user selection scheme. Additionally, discussions on the complicate convex characteristic of the total SOP with respect to the power allocation coefﬁcients and the impact the number of near and/or far users are provided.
I. INTRODUCTION
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been emerging as a rising solution to improve the spectral efﬁciency for the future wireless communication system [1]–[4]. From the principle of NOMA, which allocates the different power coefﬁcient to each users depending on the channel state information (CSI) [5], [6]. For example, in the downlink two user NOMA system consists of base station, near user (that has high CSI), and far user (that has low CSI). The base station transmits messages to both users using the superposition coding and more transmission power allocated to the far user, where the power allocation of the far user is higher than that of the near user. Under the NOMA scheme, the near user ﬁrstly decode and subtract the far user message by using the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique [5]. The signal to the far user can be decoded without interference elimination from the signal to the near user. It is noteworthy that the twouser NOMA scheme seems the most realizable and preferable among NOMA schemes proposed in industrial [1], [2] and in the literature [3], [4].
NOMA system is useful to communicate with multiple users since the principle of NOMA technique superposes the multiple user information into one signal. On the contrary, if an eavesdropper is able to overhear the message, it has the problem that the whole user information is opened to the eavesdropper. Thus, in NOMA system, the security issue is more important rather than the conventional OMA system.

One possible solution to combat against eavesdropping attacks to NOMA transmissions is to use physical layer security technique. Physical layer security (PLS) prevents information intercept from an eavesdropper using the nature of wireless medium in terms of the information theory as in [7].
The physical layer security (PLS) technique has been demonstrated as a sustainable mean to cope with security issues in NOMA networks. Indeed, the authors of [8] proposed the transmit antenna selection (TAS) scheme to improve the security performance for the down link NOMA system consisting of multiple antenna base station, two-user, and one eavesdropper. The authors of [9] studied the physical layer security for NOMA in large-scale networks. This paper consisted of the single-antenna base station, the receivers were uniformly distributed within the disc, and the eavesdroppers were distributed in an inﬁnite two dimension via a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). The authors derived the new exact and asymptotic expressions for the security outage probability. This paper was extended into the case of the multiantenna base station from the case of the single antenna base station in [10].
In this paper, we propose the new user selection scheme for multi-near and multi-far user NOMA systems using opportunistic scheduling. It is noteworthy that in uplink/downlink scenarios of the wireless communication, where the opportunistic scheduling is that a single source transmits to the selected user to improve the transmission performance [11], [12] since the channel condition is varying the nature of the wireless channels. The main contributions and features are summarized as:
• We propose an opportunistic user scheduling scheme, named the best-secure-near-user best-secure-far-user (BSNBSF) scheme. The BSNBSF aims to select the best near-far user pair, whose data transmission is the most robust against the interception of an eavesdropper. Speciﬁcally, in order to select the best user pair in a certain time slot, we take into account the channel quality of both main and eavesdropper channels.
• We derive an exact closed-form expression and a tight approximate closed-form expression for the SOP of the selected near and far users, respectively, which have not been reported in the literature. The developed analysis is then validated by Monte-Carlo simulation.
• Through the numerical results, we show that the BSNBSF

scheme signiﬁcantly improves the secrecy outage performance NOMA networks compared to that of the random near user and random far user selection scheme. Additionally, the total SOP of the considered network poses a complicate convex characteristic with respect to the power allocation coefﬁcients. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed scheduling scheme can be better by increasing number of participant near and/or far users. Notations: X ∼ CN(0, σ2) denotes a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variable X with zero mean and variance σ2; Pr(·) is the probability; fX (·) and FX (·) represent the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable X, respectively. E[·] denotes the statistical expectation operator.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Let us consider a downlink two-user NOMA system that includes a base station (S), a set of K near users, N = {Ni|i = 1, 2, ..., K}, and a set of M far users, F = {Fj|j = 1, 2, ..., M }, and an eavesdropper (E), as shown in Fig. 1. More speciﬁcally, the near users can perfectly subtract the message. The near users can perfectly use the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique to subtract the far xFj [8]. Both the legitimate and illegitimate receivers are equipped with a single antenna and operate in half-duplex mode. All wireless links are assumed to undergo independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh block ﬂat fading. Let hXY and |hXY|2 denote the channel coefﬁcient and the corresponding channel gain, respectively, of X → Y channel; let ωY denote the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at node Y, where X ∈ {S}, Y ∈ N ∪ F ∪ {E}. The average channel gain can be written as λXY = (dXY/d0)− L, where L is the reference signal power attenuation, dXY denotes the distance between X and Y, d0 presents the reference distance, and is the path-loss exponent [4]. And the channel noise is followed ωY ∼ CN(0, σY2 ). We also assume that the source perfectly knows the channel state information (CSI) of all legitimate users and eavesdropper, as in [11], [12].
A. Communication Process
In this subsection, we present the communication process in two-user NOMA system in detail. Assuming that Ni and Fj are selected to receive its data from the S in a certain time slot. From the principle of NOMA, the message xNi and xFj that will be allocated to θNi and θFj , respectively, are superposed as θNi xNi + θFj xFj and then broadcasted by S, where θNi and θFj denote the power allocation coefﬁcient. We suppose that |hSNi |2 > |hSFj |2, and set 0 < θNi < θFj and θNi + θFj = 1 as in [6].
At the near user Ni, the received signal is given by
ySNi = PSθNi hSNi xNi + PSθFj hSNi xFj + ωNi , (1)
where PS denotes the transmit power of the S. Because of the power allocated coefﬁcient condition, the near user need to subtract the component, xFj , from the ySNi using the

as

(3)

At the far user Fj, the received signal is given by

ySFj = PSθFj hSFj xFj + PSθNi hSFj xNi + ωFj . (4)

Different from the near user, the Fj directly decodes the

SINR from the received signal because of the power allocated

coefﬁcient condition. The received SINR at Fj to decode xFj

is given by

γ xFj
SFj

=

PSθFj |hSFj |2 PSθNi |hSFj |2 + σS2Fj

.

(5)

Meanwhile, the eavesdropper can intercept the signal due to
the broadcast nature of wireless medium. Thus, the received signal at E can be written as

ySE = PSθNi hSExFj + PSθFj hSExNi + ωE. (6)

Different from the legitimate user, we assume that the E has enough ability to distinguish each message from the received signal. Thus, the SINRs of the received signal are given by

respectively.

In physical layer security, the secrecy capacity means that the difference between main channel capacity and eavesdropper channel capacity. Thus, in two-user NOMA system, the secrecy capacity of xNi and xFj is given by [8], [14]

B. The Proposed Best-Secure-Near-User Best-Secure-FarUser (BSNBSF) Scheme

The proposed user selection process is conducted through the channel state information (CSI) estimation/calculation system. Thus, this process is carried out before the data communication process as in [11], [12]. In this paper, we propose the BSNBSF user selection scheme to maximize the secrecy capacity at Ni and Fj, respectively. The proposed scheme can be mathematically expressed as

(11) and (12) mean that the selected users are the best secrecy capacity of a certain time slot.

III. SECRECY OUTAGE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this section, the performance investigation of the proposed user selection scheme in terms of secrecy outage probability (SOP) is presented. Because the wireless channels undergo i.i.d. Rayleigh fading, for the sake of notational convenience, we assume that λSN1 = λSN2 = ... λSNi = λSN, λSF1 = λSF2 = ... λSFj = λSF.
Note that the ﬁxed mechanism has been widely used since it does not increase the complexity of the performance analysis while it still reﬂects the principle as well as the performance efﬁciency of NOMA. [3]. Thus, without loss of generality, we further assume that θN1 = θN2 = ... = θNi = θN and θF1 = θF2 = ... = θNj = θF.
We also assume the all nodes have the same noise variance, let γ = PS/σ2 present the transmit SNR as in [8], [11]. The SOP of a user can be deﬁned as the probability that the instantaneous secrecy capacity of the user falls below a predeﬁned target data rate [10]. Thus, the SOPs at Nb and Fb are obtained as

PSOP,Nb = Pr (Cs,Nb < Rth,Nb ) ,

(13)

and

PSOP,Fb = Pr (Cs,Fb < Rth,Fb ) ,

(14)

where Rth,Nb and Rth,Fb denote the target data rate at Nb and Fb, respectively.

At the selected near user, the SOP of Nb can be expressed

as

PSOP,Nb = Pr log2

1 + γθN|hSNb |2 1 + γθN|hSE|2

< Rth,Nb . (15)

Since all of the wireless channels are assumed to be independent, (15) can be re-written as

PSOP,Nb = Pr

i∈N

where γth,Nb 2 . Rth,Nb As we can observe that the events of
the probability in (16) are not mutually exclusive because they include the same components |hSE|2, therefore conditioning on |hSE|2 = z, the PSOP,Nb can be further expressed as:

In order to further simplify the integral (23), The following

lemma enables us to characterize the SINR at far user and eavesdropper to decode xFj .

Lemma 1. Suppose that U

Proof. The CDF of U can be written as:

FU (u) = Pr γθFρ < (γθNρ + 1)u .

(26)

After some basic manipulations, (26) can be rewritten as

FU (u) = Pr

(27)

otherwise,

After

some

steps,

the PDF of U can be obtained as presented in equation (25).

This completes the proof of Lemma 1.

For the sake of notational convenience, let Yj |hSFj |2. After some algebra manipulations, Φ in (23) can be re-written

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is very difﬁcult to obtain the exact closed-form expression of (30). Thus, in this paper, we approximate (30) using Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature [16, eq.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present the representative numerical results of the SOP of the proposed scheme. Monte-Carlo simulation results are generated to validate the developed analysis. In simulation setting, we assume that position of the source S, the cluster of near users, the cluster of far users, and the eavesdropper E are randomly deployed satisfying some given distance constraints. Speciﬁcally, we set that the distance between S and the cluster near users is dSN = 10m, the distance between S and the cluster of far users is dSF = 20m, and that the distance between S and eavesdropper is dSE = 30m, respectively. It is noted that although multiple near or far users are located at the same location, their channel characteristics are different from one to another. Additional, the reference distance d0 = 1m, and power degradation at d0 is L = 30 (dB), the path-loss exponent = 2.7.

Fig. 3. Performance comparison between the proposed BSNBSF scheme and the random near user and random far user selection (RNRF) scheme with secrecy outage probability as a function of the transmit power, where K = 3, M = 3, γth,Fb = γth,Nb = 0.1 bps/Hz.
We ﬁrst investigate the effect of power allocation mechanism on the secrecy performance of the proposed scheduling scheme as shown in ﬁg. 2, where the total SOP as in [9], [10] of selected user pair is plotted as a function of transmit power and power allocation coefﬁcient of the near user, θN. It is noted that θF = 1 − θN. As can be observed, the total SOP poses a complicated convex characteristic with respect to θN. Speciﬁcally, the total SOP is a convex function with respect to θN when the transmit SNR is less than 30 (dBm) or greater than 45 dBm under our setting, while it is not a convex function when the transmit SNR is in the range from 30 to 45 dBm. Hence, ﬁnding an optimal value of θN that minimizes the total SOP is intractable. Therefore, in this section, we adopted ﬁxed power allocation mechanism for the NOMA transmission. Speciﬁcally, the power allocation efﬁcients are set as θN = 0.2, θF = 0.8. It is noteworthy that this setting has been widely adopted in the literature [3], [4], [6].
Fig. 3 presents the performance comparison of the BSNBSF scheme and random near and random far (RNRF) scheme, in which the number of the near users are 3, and the far users are 3, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the SOP of the BSNBSF scheme is lower than the that of random selection scheme. The reason is that the proposed scheme considers

266

the secrecy channel capacity to select the near user and far user, respectively. When the increasing the transmit power, the SOP of the selected near user increased until it reaches a performance ﬂoor. Different from the case of the selected near user, the SOP of the selected far user is plotted as in convex pattern with respect to the transmit SNR.

Also, increasing number of participant near and/or far users improves the robustness of the proposed scheduling scheme.

Fig. 4 illustrates the impact of the transmit SNR and the number of near and far users on the performance of the proposed scheduling scheme. As we can be seen in Fig.4, increasing the number of near and far users does not improve the performance of the RNRF scheme. In contrast to, when the number of the near and far users is higher, the performance of the proposed scheme is improved. Since the BSNBSF scheme exploits the difference in channel conditions between users to select the best near and far users pair.
From the Figs. 3 and 4, it can be observed that the proposed scheme achieves its best performance when an appropriate transmit SNR is used. If we use higher transmit SNR than the optimal level, the total SOP is worse, which leads to a waste of transmit power.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have investigated the secrecy performance of opportunistic scheduling in multi-near user and multifar user NOMA system. We have proposed the BSNBSF scheme, which aims to improve the physical layer security of the considered NOMA system. More speciﬁcally, the proposed scheme selects the users by exploiting both main and eavesdropper channel characteristics to select the most robust near and far users. We have derived the exact closedform expression for the SOP of the selected near user and the tight approximated closed-form expression for the SOP of the selected far user, which have been veriﬁed by the computer simulation. Our results showed that the proposed scheme provided a better secrecy performance compared to random near user and random far user selection scheme.
