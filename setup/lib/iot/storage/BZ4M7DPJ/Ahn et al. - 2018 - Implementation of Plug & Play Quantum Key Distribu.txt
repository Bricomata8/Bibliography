Abstract— This paper represents an experimental implementation of the “Two way Plug & play” quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol, which uses weak coherent pulses at a single photon level to transfer key information from Alice to Bob via the quantum channel. In this experiment, we applied the 25km optical fiber channel and the results show a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of about 3%.
Keywords— Quantum key distribution, Single photon detection, Plug & Play protocol.

I. INTRODUCTION
The asymmetric public key cryptography system, which is currently used in communication systems including internet, is a cryptography protocol that is based on computational complexity [1], that is, adopts difficult mathematical problems like prime factorization algorithm as public key. However, the recent dramatic development of quantum computer has revealed that the conventional cryptography is decipherable and thus cannot ensure security [2].
Thus, the quantum key distribution (QKD) technology, which applies principles of quantum mechanics, comes into greater prominence as an alternative that could attain perfect encryption against wiretapping attack. The QKD technology was first introduced in 1984 by Bennet and Brassard [3]. The BB84 protocol proposed by them distributed keys by using four polarization states of a single photon forming two bases. Since then, a lot of studies [4-9] on QKD have been performed. Depending on types of channel implementing methods, the wired QKD uses optical fiber as channel, while the wireless QKD transmits and receives the encryption keys through atmosphere.
In this work, among wired QKD protocols, we present a practical process of implementing the plug & play QKD protocol that uses a Faraday mirror for auto compensation for polarization changes or channel vibration, which occur due to optical fiber distributing quantum keys, without separate components. The experiment using a single photon detector and 25 km quantum channel showed a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of 3% and 100 bps key rate when the mean photon number of 0.1 was employed.

1) A strong laser pulse with 1550 nm wavelength is generated from the receiver and is divided 50:50 by a beam splitter (BS).
2) Two split pulses pass a shorter path and a longer one including  and DL, respectively.
3) After passing through each path, they come out of the output of the receiver after pulses pass PBS. The output pulses after passing through the PBS have polarization components perpendicular to each other.

4) The output pulses of the receiver pass through a 25 km optical fiber channel. The pulses have the transmission loss of about 0.2dB/km.

5) After passing through the channel, the pulses are transferred to a tranmitter and are reduced to a single photon level by an attenuator. Then, the pulses are changed to polarization components, which are perpendicular to the incident polarization, by a Farraday mirror (FM), and come back to the receiver.

6) While the pulses come back from the transmitter to the receiver, when the second pulse passes through  , encryption keys are transferred by randomly applying phase shifts of 0 or  and /2 or 3/2.

7) Single photons coming back to the receiver passes through a different path from that of 2) to reach BS simultaneously, thereby causing mutual interference. The measurement basis is obtained by applying the phase shift of 0 or /2 to the first pulse entering  in the longer channel.

8) Interfered signals are detected by a single photon detector.
B. Post processing protocols
Since a sifted key received from the single photon detector in the above process usually has a bit error of about 3~7% due to the imperfect channel and transceiver system, a post processing process is essential which includes the information reconciliation for error corrections and the privacy amplification for removing information leaked during quantum communication or error correction.
For the process of information reconciliation [10], error bits have been conventionally corrected by the cascade method, which splits key blocks of the receiver and transmitter and uses a binary search based on the parity calculation of split blocks, or the winnow method based on the syndrome of hamming code. Recently, the Low-density parity-check (LDPC) code or the Polar code are also applied which show higher error correction capability.
In the privacy amplification, a Toeplitz matrix is multiplied by a reconciled key to remove any leaked information, thereby obtaining a final secret key.
III. IMPLEMENTATION OF PLUG & PLAY QKD SYSTEM
Fig. 2 shows the two-way Plug & Play QKD protocol implemented in this study. When the system is actually implemented, we can generates digital pulses of 10000 bits at a time.
The generated pulses are converted to electric signals by PXI-6542 digital waveform device, which is shown on the right side of Fig. 3. Then, strong laser pulses with 1MHz frequency are generated from the 1550 nm laser source illustrated on the left side of Fig. 3.

Laser pulses transmit a secret key as the procedure described in Section II. In this procedure, a single photon level is obtained by the following three steps.

1) Calculate the energy of single photon whose wavelength

is 1550nm:

2) Because we are using 0.1 photon level of 1MHz pulse, the power of the pulse can be shown as
 = 0.1 ∗  ∗ 1 ∗ 10/ = 1.28 ∗ 10 / (2) = 1.28 ∗ 10  = 1.28 ∗ 10  
= −108.92

3) A single photon is generated by using an attenuator to decrease the difference between the value of (2) and the subtraction of the loss of the entire system from the power of laser.

In addition, if the values of phase modulations, which are applied to PM and PM, are  and  respectively, the state of a single photon arriving at the single photon detector of the receiver can be expressed as follows.

Accordingly, the measurements results of the detector 1 and 2,
which are obtained according to  and , can be presented as in Table Ⅰ. If the measurements at   and   are matched to classical bits 0 and 1 respectively, the values of key can be obtained.

Table Ⅱ summarizes the QKD protocol specification implemented in this paper. The maximum allowable range of QBER that can guarantee safety in a general quantum cryptography system is about 10 to 15%. Therefore, it can be seen that the quantum cryptography implementation technique of this paper which transmits the quantum key 25 km has a QBER of about 3%, which is a stable security technique applicable as a quantum cryptography technique.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Plug & Play QKD experiment is conducted over a 25 km quantum channel. The laser at 1550nm generates 125 pulses at a frequency of 1MHz at a time, repeats the same procedure of 80 times to generate 10000 pulses, and the mean photon number per pulse is experimented at 0.1 level.
A sifted key received through the single photon detector of the receiver had the average QBER of 2.8%. The QBER 2.8% refers to the average error rate of the results accumulated 100 iterations after 10000 bit key is generated and the error rate is measured every time as shown in Fig 4.

Then, we applied the cascade method for error correction. We set the minimum block size to 4 and the pass to 2 in order to minimize the complexity of error correction process. Therefore, the number of paths and block sizes defined here must be set to the minimum size that can correct all the errors contained in the sift key, so we repeatedly experimented with various values to find the optimal value.

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we show the practical implementation of 2way plug & play quantum cryptography system. The laser with 1550nm wavelength band and the 2channel InGaAs Avalanche photo detectors (APDs) with 1 MHz are used to transmit and receive the key information of the QKD system. We have shown through experiments that the key transmitted over the 25 km quantum channel has a key rate of 100 bps and a QBER of about 3%.
