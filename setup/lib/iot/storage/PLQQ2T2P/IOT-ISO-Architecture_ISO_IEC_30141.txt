134 Introduction
135 Internet of Things (IoT) has a broad use in industry and society today and it will continue to develop for 136 many years to come. Various IoT applications and services have adopted IoT techniques to provide 137 capabilities that were not possible a few years ago. IoT is one of the most dynamic and exciting area of 138 the IT. It involves the connecting of physical entities (“things”) with IT systems through networks. 139 Foundational to IoT are the electronic devices that interact with physical world. Sensors get the 140 information f physical world, while actuators can act on it. Both sensors and actuators can be in many 141 forms such as thermometer, accelerometers, video cameras, microphones, relays, heathers or industrial 142 equipment for manufacturing or process controlling. Mobile technology, cloud computing, big data and 143 deep analytics (predictive, cognitive, real-time and contextual) play important roles by gathering and 144 processing data to achieve the final result of controlling physical entities.
145 IoT uses much of existing technology and combines this for improving operations and lowering costs, or 146 for creating new products and business models, or for driving engagement and customer experiences 147 etc. IoT covers a very wide spectrum of applications and represents the integration of systems from 148 different vertical sectors (enterprise, consumer, government, industries etc.).
149 Several forecasts indicate that IoT will connect 50 billion devices worldwide by the year 2020. There 150 are a number of possible application areas such as: smart city, smart grid, smart home/building, digital 151 agriculture, smart manufacturing, intelligent transport system, e-Health. IoT is an enabling technology 152 that consists of many supporting technologies, for example, different types of communication 153 networking technologies, information technologies, sensing and control technologies, software 154 technologies, device/hardware technologies. This international standard is based on widely used 155 enabling technologies that are defined in standards from several organizations such as ISO, IEC, ITU, 156 IETF, IEEE, ETSI, 3GPP, W3C, etc.
157 This document provides a standardized IoT reference architecture using a common vocabulary, 158 reusable designs and industry best practices. It uses a top down approach, beginning with collecting the 159 most important characteristics of IoT, abstracting those into a generic IoT conceptual model, deriving 160 from the conceptual model to a high level system based reference model and then breaking down from 161 reference model to the five architecture views (functional view, system view, user view, information 162 view and communication view) from different perspectives.
163 This document can be served as a base on which to develop specific IoT applications. Therefor the 164 target readers are engineers and technical managers who are going to develop or design IoT 165 applications.

215 5 IoT RA goals and objectives
216 5.1 General
217 IoT is defined as an infrastructure of interconnected physical entities, systems and information 218 resources together with the intelligent services which can process and react information of both the 219 physical world and the virtual world and can influence activities in the physical world.
220 The IoT Reference Architecture (IoT RA) described in this document provides the conceptual model 221 (CM), reference model (RM) and reference architectures (RA) from different architectural views. The 222 IoT RA not only outlines “what” the overall structured approach for the construction of IoT systems by 223 means of the architectural structure description, but also indicates “how” the architecture and its 224 domains or entities will operate. In short, the IoT RA provides rules and guidance for developing IoT 225 system architecture.
226 The IoT RA serves the following goals:

2

© ISO/IEC CD 30141 – All rights reserved

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)

227

1) to describe the characteristics of IoT systems;

228

2) to define the domains of the IoT system;

229

3) to describe CM, RM of IoT systems; IoT architecture views; and

230

4) to describe interoperability of IoT system’s entities.

231 Each IoT system has specific system requirements that should be met, and the specific system 232 requirements can vary from one IoT system to another per user group and/or domain. The IoT RA 233 provides the generic parts as a starting point which can be used to create a system specific architecture.

234 The IoT RA supports the following important standardization objectives:

235

1) to enable the production of a coherent set of international standards for IoT;

236

2) to provide a technology-neutral reference point for defining standards for IoT; and

237

3) to encourage openness and transparency in the development of a target IoT system architecture

238

and in the implementation of the IoT system.

239 The IoT RA is also intended to:

240

1) facilitate the understanding of the overall structure of IoT systems;

241

2) illustrate and provide understanding of IoT RA from different architectural views;

242

3) provide a technical reference to enable the international community to understand, discuss,

243

categorize and compare IoT systems; and

244

4) facilitate the analysis of candidate use cases/applications including data/information flows.

245 5.2 Structural overview

246 The IoT RA described in this document provides:

247

1) A CM containing common entities and their relations, and

248

2) A RM and different architecture views

267 6.2 IoT system characteristics

268 6.2.1 Auto-configuration
269 6.2.1.1 Description
270 Auto-configuration is the automatic configuration of devices based on the interworking of predefined 271 rules (associated algorithms based on data inputs). Auto-configuration includes automatic networking, 272 automatic service provisioning and plug & play. Auto-configuration allows an IoT system to react on 273 conditions and the addition and removal of components such as devices and networks. Auto274 configuration needs security and authentication mechanisms to make sure that only authorised 275 components can be auto-configured into the system. Security and authentication mechanism need to be 276 organized appropriately for each market segment.

277 6.2.1.2 Relevance to IoT systems
278 Auto-configuration is useful for IoT systems where there are many and varied components that can 279 change over time and it benefits those users who expect robust systems because auto-configuration can 280 allow automatic elimination of faulty components and maintenance of a working system.

281 6.2.1.3 Examples
282 Examples of auto-configuring devices and protocols include DHCP, Zero Configuration Networking 283 (Zeroconf), Bonjour, UPnP etc.

284 6.2.2 Function and management capability separation
285 6.2.2.1 Description
286 Separation of functional and management capabilities means that the functional interfaces and 287 capabilities of an IoT component, such as an IoT device, are cleanly separated from the management 288 interfaces and capabilities of that component. This typically means that the management interface is on 289 a different endpoint from that of the functional interface and the management capabilities are handled 290 by different software components than the functional interfaces.

291 6.2.2.2 Relevance to IoT systems 292 Management capabilities and functional capabilities have logically distinctively different

293

 purposes (execution/action vs information/description),

294

 user roles (control and modify behaviour vs transfer or consume facts and information),

295

 classification and types of data (technical or system specific vs personal/sensitive/public),

296

 access (e.g. an operator may access system configuration, but not gathered personal data; while

297

the user can access the personal data but not access and modify system configuration)

© ISO/IEC CD 30141 – All rights reserved

7

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)

298

 protocols, formats and lifecycle (e.g. support multiple control protocols vs metadata/structure of

299

the transferred information, which is particularly important considering interoperability and co-

300

existence of multiple versions and variants of management capabilities)

301 Usually, the differences have associated specific risks and require special security (and other) controls, 302 e.g. retention policy is applicable while dealing with functional data, but might not apply to 303 management data; access control may be weaker for a user and stronger for an administrator).
304 Ubiquitous penetration of IoT into virtually all areas of life increases the attack surface, multiplying the 305 number of potential attack targets and often making ineffective measures such as physical security 306 controls. The key value of IoT – the connection of numerous edge components to each other and to IoT 307 service components – increases the security concerns, since adding a weak link makes whole chain 308 weak. Applications and systems previously running in well-protected data centers may become exposed 309 to additional threats via connected IoT components.
310 Separation of management from functional capabilities enables or strengthens the ability to apply 311 different authorization, authentication and protection mechanisms or constraints to management as 312 opposed to functional capabilities. Broad sharing of data from an IoT system might be useful or 313 desirable, and yet there are many circumstances where it is necessary to limit control of an IoT system 314 or component to only a subset of the entities with which the data from that IoT system is shared.
315 6.2.2.3 Examples
316 If an IoT system is used to provide sensors and data for HVAC or other building management systems, it 317 might be desirable to share data with other inter-related systems (alarms, access control, power 318 management or auxiliary power, etc.), while still retaining management of the system to ensure system 319 constraints are respected.
320 6.2.3 Highly distributed systems
321 6.2.3.1 Description
322 Distributed systems are the systems which, while being functionally integrated, consists of sub-systems 323 which may be physically separated and remotely located from one another. These sub-systems are 324 normally connected by a communication link (e.g. data bus). (ISO 3511-4)
325 6.2.3.2 Relevance to IoT systems
326 IoT systems can span whole buildings, span whole cities, and even span the globe. Wide distribution can 327 also apply to data – which can be stored at the edge of the network or stored centrally. Distribution can 328 also apply to processing – some processing takes place centrally (in cloud services), but processing can 329 take place at the edge of the network, either in the IoT gateways or even within (more capable types of) 330 sensors and actuators. Today there are officially more mobile devices than people in the world. Mobile 331 devices and networks are one of the best known IoT devices and networks.
332 6.2.3.3 Examples
333 For industry 4.0, productions can be done using smart manufactory systems which have highly 334 distributed assembly lines across the factories and closely integrated with 3rd party suppliers, logistics 335 companies, market providers and customers etc.

336 6.2.4 Network communication
337 6.2.4.1 Description
338 IoT systems depend on network communications of a number of different types. There are often limited 339 range, low power networks collectively termed proximity networks that form the local connections for 340 IoT devices. There are the wide area networks that connect the proximity networks to the internet, 341 which can take wired and wireless forms and which may be dedicated to the IoT system or which may 342 be shared general purpose networks.
343 Communication protocols used can vary between the different network types. It is common for 344 proximity networks to use specialized protocols suited to the specialized nature of these networks. IP is 345 more typically used for the wide area networks, although the higher levels in the protocol stack can 346 vary, with HTTP being used in some cases, and messaging protocols being used in other cases. Some 347 networks are deliberately intermittent in nature and the protocols used for such networks reflect the 348 intermittent transmission pattern.
349 6.2.4.2 Relevance to IoT systems
350 IoT systems rely on the ability to exchange information units in a structured manner based upon 351 different but interoperable kinds of network types. Devices need to both transmit and receive data and 352 need to communicate with software services that may be located nearby or in a remote location.
353 Gateways may be employed to connect networks of different types, typically between the proximity 354 networks and the wide area. Network structure may need to be dynamic and needs to consider 355 properties such as QoS, resilience, security and management capabilities.
356 6.2.4.3 Examples
357 In a proximity network, IoT devices can be connected by wireless technology, e.g., IEEE 802.15.4 and 358 IEEE 802.11 in communication protocols on physical and data link layers. Data may be transported by 359 6LowPAN which is IoT specific IP and UDP. The IoT devices are then connected to a dedicated or 360 general purpose wide area network via area a Gateway which routes data between the proximity 361 network and the wide area network as necessary.
362 6.2.5 Network management and operation
363 6.2.5.1 Description
364 IoT systems require network management. The form of network management and operation depend on 365 the network type and network ownership and the type of communication taking place over the network. 366 Management is required during the setting up of a network, including the handling of device identity 367 and addresses, profiles for the usage of the network and the inclusion of dynamic management 368 capabilities. Management of the networks in-service involves control over QoS, dynamic extension of 369 the networks (for new or updated IoT devices), fault handling and security control.
370 6.2.5.2 Relevance to IoT systems
371 Some networks are managed as part of the IoT system – particularly the proximity networks connecting 372 the IoT devices. Other networks, particularly the wide area networks, may not be managed as part of 373 the IoT system, since they are general purpose networks often run by other organizations (e.g. mobile 374 phone networks).
375 IoT network management has to span both kinds of networks and assemble them into a coherent 376 system that can serve the purposes of the IoT system. Where IoT systems make use of third party

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)
377 general purpose communication networks, their management and operational interfaces can be used, 378 where available.
379 6.2.5.3 Examples
380 Energy monitoring by smart meters is an example of a context where strict operation and management 381 will be likely, since there is a commercial interest in such an IoT system being free of unauthorized 382 activity. In such a context, all of the IoT devices, communication networks and information processing 383 platforms are managed.
384 On the other hand, in case of home energy management, it is not necessary that the individual device be 385 managed strictly. The management of the networks and information processing platforms of the 386 vendor’s support infrastructure will be done more as a means of selling more devices than as a profit387 generating service in itself.
388 6.2.6 Real time capability
389 6.2.6.1 Description
390 Real time capability is pertaining to a system or mode of operation in which computation is performed 391 during the actual time that an external process occurs, in order that the computation results can be used 392 to control, monitor, or respond in a timely manner to the external process. (ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765)
393 6.2.6.2 Relevance to IoT systems
394 IoT systems often function in real time; data flows in continually about events in progress and there can 395 be a need to produce timely responses to that stream of events. This may involve stream processing; 396 acting on the event data as it arrives, comparing it against previous events and also against static data in 397 order to react in the most appropriate way.
398 6.2.6.3 Examples
399 In process control, process parameters like temperature, flow, or pressure or status of a device are 400 continuously monitored by sensors and instant actions are initiated.
401 6.2.7 Self-description
402 6.2.7.1 Description
403 Self-description is process by which components of an IoT system describe their capabilities in order to 404 inform other IoT components or other IoT systems for the purposes of composition and interoperability. 405 Self-description includes interface specification, the capabilities of the IoT component, what types of 406 devices can be connected to an IoT system, what kinds of service are made available by the IoT system, 407 and the current state of the IoT system.
408 6.2.7.2 Relevance to IoT systems
409 Self-description is needed for composability and interoperability for IoT systems and IoT devices. Self410 description is of most benefit for those use cases where an IoT system needs to be interconnected with 411 other IoT systems or those use cases where an IoT system benefits from being extended by the addition 412 of new IoT devices.

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)
413 6.2.7.3 Examples
414 Example of self-description for an IoT system and protocols: A system which uses Bluetooth in its 415 proximity networks provides device name and supported service list to each other when connecting.
416 Access points broadcast the SSID. Wi-Fi devices send passwords and MAC addresses to an access point 417 when connecting to it.
418 6.2.8 Service subscription
419 6.2.8.1 Description
420 It is often the case that IoT users subscribe to IoT services made available by IoT service providers. In 421 this case, the IoT service providers make available a subscription process by which the IoT users can 422 subscribe to a particular IoT service. The subscription process can include payments, plus a clear 423 statement of any pre-requisites that apply to the IoT user. It can be the case that the IoT service 424 involves the installation of IoT devices and the installation and configuration of software components – 425 these are typically provided or specified by the IoT service provider.
426 In some alternative cases, the IoT user can establish their own IoT service, but in this case the IoT user 427 has the burden of acquiring the necessary equipment and software and has the subsequent 428 responsibilities for operating and maintaining the IoT service.
429 6.2.8.2 Relevance to IoT systems
430 Some IoT systems are established on the basis of a subscription model where the IoT users pay for their 431 use of the IoT system – in these cases, the IoT service provider must establish clear mechanisms for 432 establishing and maintaining the subscriptions.
433 6.2.8.3 Examples
434 An example of a subscription-oriented IoT service is the provision of personal fitness monitoring, where 435 the IoT user must purchase a wearable IoT device that is then connected to an IoT service that monitors 436 their activity and provides analysis and advice on how their activity is helping the user achieve life goals.
437 6.3 IoT service characteristics
438 6.3.1 Content-Awareness
439 6.3.1.1 Description
440 Content-Awareness is the property of being aware of the information in an IoT component and its 441 associated metadata. Content-Awareness devices and services are able to adapt interfaces, abstract 442 application data, improve information retrieval precision, discover services, and enable appropriate 443 user interactions.
444 6.3.1.2 Relevance to IoT systems
445 Content-Awareness facilitates appropriate functional operations, such as data routing, speed of delivery, 446 security capabilities such as encryption, based on factors such as location, quality of service 447 requirements and sensitivity of data.

11

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)

448 6.3.1.3 Examples
449 This capability can be essential in many applications including health services, broadcasting, 450 surveillance systems and emergency services where some types of information or data flows have 451 specific requirements with respect to timeliness, security and privacy.
452 6.3.2 Context-Awareness (location awareness, time awareness)
453 6.3.2.1 Description
454 Context-Awareness is the property of an IoT device, service or system being able to monitor its own 455 operating environment and events within that environment to determine information such as when 456 (time awareness), where (location awareness), or in what order (awareness of sequence of events) one 457 or more observations occurred in the physical world.
458 6.3.2.2 Relevance to IoT systems
459 Context-Awareness enables flexible, user-customized and autonomic services based on the related 460 context of IoT components and/or users. Context information is used as the basis for taking actions in 461 response to observations, possibly through the use of sensor information and actuators. To fully utilize 462 an observation and effect an action, the understanding of context is often critical.
463 6.3.2.3 Examples
464 An example of location-based services is a system which different services according to the location of a 465 user.
466 In cases of an emergency like a fire, the arrival of the fire service requires that the doors to a building 467 shall be unlocked. The security policy that governs the door’s access can be enhanced with context. The 468 context here is that an emergency situation is currently happening and that the emergency services are 469 in the vicinity. Based on these two contextual inputs the policy could enable the system to unlock the 470 door automatically and provide access without the need for further authorisation.
471 6.3.3 Timeliness
472 6.3.3.1 Description
473 Timeliness is the property of performing an action, function, or service within a specified period of time.
474 6.3.3.2 Relevance to IoT systems
475 Because IoT systems act on the physical world, some actions need to occur at certain times. To achieve 476 this, the actions, functions, and services that lead to such events need to happen within specific time 477 constraints. Timeliness in IoT includes not only latency related issues, but other aspects such as jitter, 478 frequency/sampling rate, and phase.
479 6.3.3.3 Examples
480 An IoT system for smart meters needs to collect energy consumption data within specific time 481 constraints in order for the grid system to react to demand.
482 In an industrial manufacturing process, an example is where some sensors are monitoring the quality of 483 items flowing down an automated production line. Any items which are considered below the required 484 quality must be removed from the line. The removal is performed by some actuators that divert the 485 relevant items off the line. To achieve this, there is a strict time limit on commanding the actuators to

12

© ISO/IEC CD 30141 – All rights reserved

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)

486 perform the diversion – all the processing of sensor information and other relevant data must be 487 completed within the time limit. Where IoT entities are part of any kind of control loop, overall 488 processing time for the loop is critical.
489 6.4 IoT component characteristics
490 6.4.1 Composability
491 6.4.1.1 Description
492 Composability is the ability to combine the discrete IoT components into an IoT system to achieve a set 493 of goals and objectives.

494 6.4.1.2 Relevance to IoT systems
495 System integration, interoperability and composability deal with how the functional components are 496 assembled to form a complete IoT system and how the functional components connect to each other 497 and the binding mechanisms which are used (e.g. dynamic or static, agent-based or peer-to-peer). 498 Interoperability and composability are important topics in both the cyber and physical spaces. 499 Composability imposes a stronger requirement than interoperability in that it requires components not 500 only compatible in their interfaces but exchangeable with other components of the same kind that share 501 similar characteristics such as timing behaviours, performance, scalability and security. When a 502 component is replaced by another of the same kind that is composable, the overall system functions and 503 characteristics are unchanged.

504 6.4.1.3 Examples
505 An example of composability might be the ability to swap out sensor components from one vendor and 506 replace them with sensor components produced by a different vendor. In this example, there might be 507 two levels of composability.
508 First would be complete interchangeability of “commodity” functionality, such as an IoT device from 509 Vendor A being fully replaceable with one from Vendor B.
510 A second level of composability (or possibly interoperability) might be an IoT control that is vendor511 specific at the interface between the IoT component and a physical process device being controlled (a 512 valve, motor, switch, pump or fan, for example), but is still fully interchangeable at the interface 513 between the IoT device and the rest of the IoT system. In this sort of example, the IoT device would 514 serve as a kind of “middleware” between the vendor-agnostic IoT infrastructure, and the vendor515 specific physical devices or mechanisms being controlled.
516 6.4.2 Discoverability
517 6.4.2.1 Description
518 Discoverability allows users, services, and other devices, to find not only devices on the network but 519 also the capabilities and services they offer at any particular time. Discovery services allow IoT users, 520 services, devices and data from devices to be located, identified, and accessed according to different 521 criteria, such as geographic location, security, safety and privacy.

522 6.4.2.2 Relevance to IoT systems
523 Services connected with an IoT system can indicate what information can be found by a 524 Discovery/Lookup service in accordance with predefined rules for each market segment. 525 Discovery/Lookup services allow IoT systems to locate other devices, services or systems based on

© ISO/IEC CD 30141 – All rights reserved

13

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)

526 parameters such as geographical location, capabilities, interfaces, accessibility, ownership, security 527 policy, operational configuration, data provided, data consumed, or other relevant factors.
528 6.4.2.3 Example
529 IoT systems which support dynamic configuration, such as the addition of new devices and services to 530 the IoT system, have a requirement for some form of discoverability, since there is a need to identify 531 and characterize new components added to the system. So the addition of a new temperature sensor in 532 a building monitoring IoT system is an example, where it is necessary to bring the new sensor into the 533 existing system with minimum effort. Various protocols and software solutions exist to provide 534 discovery in IoT systems, with a variety of architectures, some server based others being peer-to-peer. 535 Examples include Hypercat, Alljoyn and Consul.
536 6.4.3 Modularity
537 6.4.3.1 Description
538 Modularity is when a component is a distinct unit that can be combined with other components.
539 6.4.3.2 Relevance to IoT systems
540 Modularity allows components to be combined in different configurations to form systems as needed. 541 By focusing on standardized interfaces and not specifying the internal workings of each component, 542 implementers have flexibility in the design of components and IoT systems.
543 6.4.3.3 Examples
544 An example of Modularity in an IoT system might be a smart thermostat. Because the interface to an 545 HVAC system and the interface to a larger IoT infrastructure could both be defined in compliance with 546 open interface standards, there is nothing to prevent a thermostat from Vendor A being replaced by one 547 from Vendor B. Furthermore, it is not important how the functionality of the device is implemented. 548 Vendor A might provide the capability in the form of an ASIC-based state machine, while Vendor B’s 549 design might be based on a microcontroller. As long as both devices perform the same functions in 550 response to the same inputs, and they are both compliant with open standard interfaces without 551 imposing any proprietary constraints, there is nothing to prevent one from being replaced by the other.
552 6.4.4 Network connectivity
553 6.4.4.1 Description
554 In IoT systems, components communicate with each other across network links. The connections 555 between components are established using either wired or wireless media. Networked IoT devices that 556 originate, route and terminate communications are described as (network) nodes. Endpoint network 557 devices are the source or destination of any kind of information. Any IoT related networking 558 communications protocol is layered onto more specific or more general communications protocols, 559 down to the physical layer that directly deals with the transmission media at every network node.
560 6.4.4.2 Relevance to IoT systems
561 IoT systems rely on the ability to exchange information in a structured manner based upon multiple 562 different but interworkable network topologies – all within a physical, wired or wireless network. IoT 563 devices are called “networked” when one device is able to exchange information with other devices 564 whether or not they have a direct connection to each other. IoT network structure can be static or 565 dynamic and may have capabilities such as QoS, resilience, encryption, authentication and authorisation.

566 6.4.4.3 Examples
567 The Scale of an IoT network can vary substantially, from local proximity networks connecting a handful 568 of devices over a limited distance, to global scale networks operating at Internet scale and connecting 569 very large numbers of devices and service components.
570 It is typical for the networks in IoT systems to be heterogeneous and connected to each other via 571 gateways or equivalent components.
572 6.4.5 Shareability
573 6.4.5.1 Description
574 Shareability is the ability to share the use of an individual component between multiple interconnected 575 systems.
576 6.4.5.2 Relevance to IoT systems
577 Many IoT components are underutilized since a single system often uses only a fraction of a 578 component’s capabilities. Resources can be used more efficiently if the functionalities of components 579 can be shared among multiple systems.
580 6.4.5.3 Examples
581 The motion detection capabilities of a lighting control system could be leveraged by the security system 582 to increase the security systems capability.
583 Temperature sensing for heating control could be used by the security system for fire detection.
584 6.4.6 Unique identification
585 6.4.6.1 Description
586 Unique identification is the characteristic of an IoT system to enable the entities to be identifiable and 587 traceable. These entities include the components of the IoT system itself, such as the software 588 components, the sensors and actuators and the network components.
589 6.4.6.2 Relevance to IoT systems
590 It is essential that the entities in an IoT system can be distinguished from each other. This enables 591 interoperability and global services across heterogeneous IoT systems. It is important for entities to be 592 uniquely identifiable so that IoT systems can monitor and communicate with specific entities. A variety 593 of identification schemes may be supported in specific implementations of IoT systems to meet the 594 application requirements.
595 6.4.6.3 Examples
596 IPv4, IPv6, URI, and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) are used as unique, unambiguous 597 identification of network endpoints in internet applications. Individual hardware devices, software etc. 598 may have unique manufacturer’s IDs, OIDs, UUIDs or other identifiers, which can be used to tag data 599 from those entities or direct commands to them.
600 Physical entities are often given unique identifiers in the form of RFID tags, barcodes and equivalent 601 labelling technologies. For humans, biometric information can be used to provide unique identification.

602 6.5 Compatibility
603 6.5.1 Legacy support
604 6.5.1.1 Description
605 Legacy support is the concept that an IoT system might need to incorporate existing installed 606 components even where these components embody technologies that are no longer standard or 607 approved. A service, a protocol, a device, system, component, technology, or standard that is outdated 608 but which is still in current use, may need to be incorporated into an IoT system.
609 6.5.1.2 Relevance to IoT systems
610 Support of legacy component integration and migration can be important, although when supporting 611 legacy components, it is also important to ensure that the design of new components and systems does 612 not unnecessarily limit future system evolution. To prevent prematurely stranding legacy investment, a 613 plan for adaptation and migration of legacy systems is important. Care ought to be taken when 614 integrating legacy components to ensure that security and other essential performance and functional 615 requirements are met. Legacy components may increase risk and vulnerabilities. Since current 616 technology becomes legacy technology in the future it is important to have a process in place for 617 managing legacy aspects of IoT. The different lifecycles of physical systems and information systems 618 also creates additional challenges for managing legacy aspects in IoT.
619 6.5.1.3 Examples
620 One example of transition from legacy to future compatibility is the current slow rollover from IPv4 621 compliance to IPv6 compliance. The limits of the IPv4 address space and of the IPv4 protocol are known, 622 and the transition to IPv6 is clearly the way of the future, but the varying pace of the transition, 623 depending on the context, makes it a topic which can be very complex.
624 Many existing standards and application environments still assume and depend on IPv4, and yet it’s 625 clear that continuing to use IPv4 forever is not a viable strategy. Deciding how and when to make the 626 transition, however, is a topic that nobody has a universal answer to.
627 The end result is that different market segments, vendors and communities of interest are each 628 pursuing their own strategies for the v4 to v6 transition, and anybody whose activities straddles several 629 of these different transition strategy enclaves has an additional layer of complexity draped over the 630 individual transition strategies.
631 6.5.2 Well-defined components
632 6.5.2.1 Description
633 IoT entities are deemed to be well-defined when an accurate description of their capabilities and 634 characteristics is available, including any associated uncertainties. Capability information includes not 635 only information about the specific component functionality, but configuration, communication, 636 security, reliability and other relevant information.
637 6.5.2.2 Relevance to IoT systems
638 Many components are used to assemble an IoT system. They are typically discovered through an 639 information system interface and information about the component may not be available. Without 640 understanding the capabilities of each component that will be used within a system it is difficult to 641 understand whether the system meets its design goals.

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)

642 6.5.2.3 Examples
643 An example of an implementation of a well-defined component is: A particular IoT component is 644 available with varying amounts of memory or support for various RF frequencies, waveforms and 645 protocols. Such a device has a baseline information interface which all the variants make use of to 646 inform other IoT components of the list of capabilities possessed by the device. Once the devices’ 647 respective configurations have been exchanged, each device’s software or applications can then self648 adjust to take into account the capabilities of the other devices.

649 6.6 Usability

650 6.6.1 Flexibility

651 6.6.1.1 Description
652 Flexibility is the capability of an IoT system, service, device or other component to provide a varied 653 range of functionality, depending on need or context.

654 6.6.1.2 Relevance to IoT systems
655 History and experience tell us that while there are exceptions, the economic and functional sweet spot 656 for flexibility is usually somewhere in the middle, between the extremes of a dedicated single purpose 657 component on one end of the spectrum, and a massively capable, programmable, extensible, “all things 658 to all people” general purpose component.

659 It is possible to break down the general concept of flexibility into different sub-categories or dimensions.

660 One dimension of flexibility is the distinction between IoT capabilities hosted on a platform powered by 661 a general purpose computing core and a similar capability implemented in the form of state machines 662 implemented using discrete components, programmable FPGAs, or a purpose-specific ASIC. The state 663 machine versions tend to be smaller, faster, more power efficient, and potentially more secure (due to a 664 more limited range of capability). The general purpose version trades off speed, size, power draw and 665 other traits to gain more generalized capabilities, and a greater ability to adapt to meet unanticipated 666 future requirements.

667 A second dimension of flexibility is illustrated by the distinction between the following kinds of device:

668

1) A device which has fixed, nonprogrammable, non-extensible functionality – “hard wired, single

669

purpose”.

670

2) A device which has fixed H/W capability, but which provides some amount of configurability

671

within the single available format.

672

3) A device which is both programmable and expandable in the hardware domain – such as adding

673

memory, adding more computational capability or adding RF channel capability.

674

4) A family of devices, each of which might fall into categories 1-3, from which an integrator can

675

select the one(s) which are appropriate for a given context.

676

5) A family of devices such as in 4, where some of the options provide different amounts of

677

composability or modularity, at different levels of abstraction.

678 A third dimension of flexibility might involve the range of standards, protocols, formats, and interfaces 679 which an IoT component is designed to support, where that support might then be designed and 680 implemented taking the factors above into account.

17

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)
681 Aside from the IoT component, there is another dimension of flexibility that involves the overall design 682 of the IoT system. As in other domains, there will likely be open IoT ecosystems, and proprietary IoT 683 ecosystems, with varying amounts of overlap between the two.
684 6.6.1.3 Examples
685 An example of differences flexibility relating to a sensor device is such as a thermostat. The simplest 686 devices may only offer simple temperature control and reporting of temperature. More sophisticated 687 and flexible thermostats allow for remote control via smartphone, can be connected to other IoT 688 devices in the building to detect occupancy, to gain information about the weather and so on – and 689 these more capable devices typically have software components that can themselves be upgraded to 690 offer newer capabilities.
691 6.6.2 Manageability
692 6.6.2.1 Description
693 Manageability addresses aspects of IoT systems such as device management, network management, 694 system management, and interface maintenance and alerts. Manageability is important to meet IoT 695 system requirements. Components capable of monitoring the system and changing configurations are 696 needed for manageability of the IoT device, network and system.
697 6.6.2.2 Relevance to IoT systems
698 Many IoT devices, networks, and systems are unmanned and run automatically. Special care must be 699 taken to ensure that such systems remain manageable even when parts of the system malfunction, 700 become unstable or mis-calibrated in the course of operation. Even in circumstances where individual 701 IoT entities are accessible, the potentially large scale and geographic span of IoT systems argues for the 702 ability to manage IoT entities remotely to the greatest extent possible, to increase both convenience and 703 operational effectiveness.
704 6.6.2.3 Examples
705 IoT devices such as smoke sensors are deployed in various locations in buildings. These devices are 706 often hard to maintain because of their locations. Any type of malfunction could cause undesirable 707 events and consequences. Thus, remote manageability should be a system design consideration and 708 goal from the beginning of specification, and throughout the development, and deployment, and 709 operational lifecycle of the IoT system.
710 Additionally, software updates are necessary to ensure that devices and systems maintain functionality 711 and the latest security vulnerabilities are patched. The manageability capabilities of an IoT entity might 712 include device state monitoring capability, the link monitoring, calibration, etc.
713 6.7 Robustness
714 6.7.1 Accuracy
715 6.7.1.1 Description
716 In the context of reliability, accuracy is the capability of an IoT device, service or system to provide 717 calculations or actions within the expected range of acceptable precision.

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)
718 6.7.1.2 Relevance to IoT systems
719 An appropriate level of accuracy is essential to some IoT system deployments and applications. 720 Depending on the context, differing degrees of accuracy might be required.
721 6.7.1.3 Examples
722 In a medical or manufacturing context, it might be critical for an IoT Device, application or system 723 providing temperature information or control to be accurate to within a tenth of a degree Fahrenheit, 724 while in a home HVAC context, accuracy to plus or minus two degrees might be adequate.
725 6.7.2 Reliability
726 6.7.2.1 Description
727 Reliability is the consistent intended behaviour of a system. An appropriate level of reliability in 728 capabilities such as communication, service and data management capabilities is important to meet 729 system requirements.
730 6.7.2.2 Relevance to IoT systems
731 An appropriate level of reliability is essential in diverse IoT system deployments and applications. 732 Reliability can be highly critical in some applications, e.g. for specific health related applications, 733 industrial manufacturing operations and time-critical applications.
734 6.7.2.3 Examples
735 Reliability of data is of great importance for the decision-making processes of many IoT systems. The 736 absence of data or data corruption can lead to incorrect decisions or the failure to make decisions. 737 Reliability of communications networks is important for ensuring the availability and correct operation 738 of IoT systems, particularly in mission-critical use cases.
739 Medical devices are one potential IoT application area where the specifications for mean time between 740 failure might be quite stringent, due to the possibility of injury or death if an IoT device, application or 741 system providing medical capability were to fail while a patient is being treated.
742 6.7.3 Resilience
743 6.7.3.1 Description
744 Resilience is the ability of an IoT system or its components to continue to perform their required 745 function in the presence of faults and failures.
746 6.7.3.2 Relevance to IoT systems
747 Communication, device or software component failures are to be expected in IoT systems and without 748 appropriate design, they can escalate quickly causing the global failure of the system. IoT systems need 749 to be designed for resilience, incorporating self-monitoring and self-healing techniques to improve the 750 system resilience.
751 6.7.3.3 Examples
752 An IoT system has to be resilient to gateway failures to ensure continuing communications paths 753 between software components and IoT devices.

754 One approach to resiliency is to adopt a master-slave design where if the master unit fails then a 755 redundant device is available to assume the master role.
756 For networks, a mesh network design is resilient to the failure of one link or one node - data can still 757 flow from source to sink through an alternative route.
758 6.8 Security
759 6.8.1 Availability
760 6.8.1.1 Description
761 Availability is the ability of a system to be accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity. IoT 762 systems can include both human users and service components as "authorized entities".
763 6.8.1.2 Relevance to IoT systems
764 In IoT systems, availability can be seen in terms of devices, data and services. Availability of a device is 765 related both to its inherent properties of operating correctly over time and to the network connectivity 766 of the device. Availability of data is related to the ability of the system to get the requested data from a 767 system component. Availability of services is related to the ability of the system to provide the 768 requested service to users with a pre-defined QoS.
769 6.8.1.3 Examples
770 In some critical applications, e.g. health monitoring or intrusion detection, devices and data have to be 771 always available so that alarms can be sent to the system immediately when raised. In these cases, 772 system design must take into account potential failure modes and provide means of continuing 773 operations, such as power supply backups, redundant devices, multiple instances of a service.
774 6.8.2 Confidentiality
775 6.8.2.1 Description
776 Confidentiality is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized 777 individuals, entities, or processes.
778 6.8.2.2 Relevance to IoT systems
779 In an IoT system the confidentiality protection is responsible for prohibiting people or systems from 780 reading data or control messages when they are not authorized to do so.
781 Confidentiality is a pre-requisite for a secure operation especially when the data to be transmitted 782 contains secret tokens, e.g. for access control. Confidentiality is also required to protect sensitive data, 783 which may include financial information or personal data (see the clause on Privacy).
784 6.8.2.3 Examples
785 Many items of data flowing an IoT system need to be treated as confidential – in the hands of the wrong 786 recipient the data could be used for criminal acts or represent inappropriate use of personal data. For 787 example, IoT motion detection sensors could reveal whether a property is occupied or not – which 788 could be used by thieves to target the property.
789 Similar concerns relate to IoT smart meters – where even the frequency of messages transmitted should 790 not depend on the rate of electricity use, since this could reveal whether a property is occupied or not.

791 6.8.3 Integrity
792 6.8.3.1 Description
793 Data integrity is the property that data has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized and 794 undetected manner. [ISO_19790:2012, 3.58] Given that data is the basis on which IoT systems operate, 795 tampering or destruction of data flowing or stored in the system could compromise the operation of the 796 system and lead to highly undesirable outcomes.
797 6.8.3.2 Relevance to IoT systems
798 Data integrity is vital for IoT systems to ensure that the data used for decision-making processes in the 799 system and executable software has not been altered by faulty or unauthorized devices or by malicious 800 actors. The protection of the integrity of the data is a key requirement to ensure the security of the IoT 801 system.
802 6.8.3.3 Examples
803 In IoT deployments that comprise of multi-hop wireless sensor networks there is a risk that 804 intermediate nodes may alter the data and this can have impact on the functioning of the system. For 805 example, an intermediate node may increase the value of the temperature of a room but this should not 806 cause the air-conditioning system to increase the amount of cooling.
807 6.8.4 Safety
808 6.8.4.1 Description
809 Safety is the freedom from risk which is not tolerable. Risk is the combination of probability of 810 occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. Harm includes injury or damage to the health of 811 people, or damage to property or the environment. Harm can be due to malfunction, failure, or accident. 812 While prior traits describe the desired behaviour of the system when operating correctly, Safety 813 includes the consideration of failure modes with the intent of preventing, reducing or mitigating the 814 potential for undesired outcomes; specifically, damage, harm or loss.
815 6.8.4.2 Relevance to IoT systems
816 Many IoT systems are deployed in contexts or operational environments where damage, loss, injury or 817 death might result if failure modes are not adequately addressed. In many operational contexts, 818 approval to operate or approval to connect will not be granted if safety requirements are not met.
819 Even in contexts where compliance with safety standards is optional or voluntary rather than 820 mandatory, proper consideration of safety factors may have significant impact on aspects such as: 821 continuity of operations, reduction of loss, prevention of injury or death, insurance premiums, torts and 822 liability, and other issues.
823 6.8.4.3 Examples
824 IoT contexts where safety standards or requirements might need to be considered include medical or 825 health care applications, transport such as aviation and automotive applications, consumer products, 826 buildings, and environment monitoring. Many countries will have specific regulations related to such 827 applications.

828 6.9 Protection of personally identifiable information
829 6.9.1 Description
830 Protection of personally identifiable information (PII) is a legal or regulatory requirement in most 831 jurisdictions whenever an IoT system involves personally identifiable information anywhere in its 832 operation.
833 Privacy is the right of individuals to control or influence what information related to them may be 834 collected and stored and by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed. (Based on ISO/TS 835 17574:2009, 3.16) The concept of privacy overlaps, but does not coincide, with the concept of data. 836 With respect to data protection it ensures that PII is not gathered or processed without the informed 837 consent of the PII principal, and is not disclosed to unauthorized entities. For IoT systems, entities 838 include both people, machines and processes.
839 The principle of data minimisation applies to PII: the quantity of PII collected is the minimal necessary 840 to support the application. The PII which is necessarily present should be securely deleted when no 841 longer needed. This protects the individual and minimizes legal risk to the organization using the PII. If 842 PII is disclosed it must be based on prior informed consent given by the PII principal for the intended 843 purpose.
844 6.9.2 Relevance to IoT systems
845 Many IoT systems do not collect or interchange PII. However, any IoT system which does collect, 846 receive and/or interchange personal information needs to ensure that such IoT systems and their 847 interactions with other IoT systems (or IT systems in general) are in full compliance with privacy 848 protection requirements of applicable jurisdictional domains.
849 One aspect of IoT systems is that the nature of the data handled by the system can be unclear. For 850 example, a home automation IoT system may appear to be dealing in data that is not PII, but if (say) the 851 electrical usage data of a house is present in the system, if the data can be connected with a specific 852 house, it is likely that the data is connected with specific people and can be regarded as PII.
853 IoT systems need careful analysis to understand if any of the data they handle is or is potentially PII. If 854 PII is present, then the IoT system must be designed to meet appropriate data protection regulations 855 and laws in the relevant jurisdiction(s).
856 6.9.3 Examples
857 Many IoT applications involve end-users and the collection of specific data relating to them. For 858 example, traffic speed cameras record a number plate and often an image of the driver’s face. This 859 information is correlated with licensing records to allow fines to be levied. However, such data cannot 860 be retained beyond a pre-defined time and should not be made available for other purposes. Mobile 861 phone location can be tracked and while this can be useful for a user to receive information about 862 facilities in the area, access to such information should be controlled; it may be required for police 863 investigations but users may not want to receive adverts for local venues.
864 In particular, with healthcare monitoring and other such monitoring of specific individuals there is a 865 need for the data to be provided only for the agreed purpose for example to update a GP or personal 866 healthcare record and not for use by other institutions such as insurance companies.
867 Driver may be providing data for traffic monitoring systems (location and speed) allowing traffic 868 congestion to be reported but would not necessarily expect this data to be linked to an employer’s 869 system. Similarly, tracking people movement in offices may be possible with a building surveillance and

22

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)

870 access system but noting times of rest breaks etc., may not have been part of the purpose of the data 871 collection.
872 Smart metering applications are another example where an individual may grant access to data for a 873 particular purpose. The smart meter is collecting real-time information about electricity usage in the 874 home and transmitting it to the electricity utility, who may use the data for a variety of purposes, 875 including demand management and differential pricing. It is clear that the data relates to the people 876 living in that home and may reveal significant details about their lives. It is necessary for the electricity 877 utility organization to inform the householder about the PII they are gathering and to be clear about its 878 use. The electricity utility also needs to apply appropriate protection to the data (e.g. encrypt data 879 streams flowing from the smart meter), and apply privacy principles to the processing of the data, 880 including minimising the data, anonymizing the data and deleting the data as soon as possible.
881 Several governments and group of states has issues laws based on the European directive 2016/680 on 882 Privacy, especially to protect citizens from the increasing exposures of their PII in the daily digital life 883 on the net. A set of laws to be implemented to provide rules for the business how to handle PII and 884 make it certain that PII is not exposed more than the business relation requires.
885 6.10 Other characteristics
886 6.10.1 Data– Volume, Velocity, Veracity, Variability and Variety
887 6.10.1.1 Description
888 The "Data 5Vs" of volume, velocity, veracity, variability and variety often apply to IoT systems. The Data 889 5Vs derive from Big Data systems – but it is often the case that IoT systems are the source of data which 890 is large in volume, delivered at speed across network links, whose veracity needs to be validated (e.g. 891 due to malfunctioning sensors), which can vary over time and can contain a wide variety of different 892 data types from different IoT components.
893 6.10.1.2 Relevance to IoT systems
894 IoT Systems are also expected to generate large amounts of data from diverse locations. The data may 895 be aggregated into centralized locations or it may be stored in distributed locations (depending on the 896 nature of the data, the processing required on the data and the communication link characteristics), 897 which generates a need to appropriately index, store and process the data.

898 6.10.1.3 Examples
899 A logistics company uses big data analytics for an On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation 900 service. The system uses numerous address data points, plus other data collected during deliveries, to 901 optimize delivery routes.
902 6.10.2 Heterogeneity
903 6.10.2.1 Description
904 An IoT system typically is composed of a diverse set of components and physical entities that interact in 905 various ways.

906 6.10.2.2 Relevance to IoT systems
907 IoT is typically cross-system, cross-product, and cross-domain. Realizing the full potential of IoT 908 requires interoperability between heterogeneous components and systems. This heterogeneity creates 909 numerous challenges for the resulting IoT systems.

910 6.10.2.3 Examples
911 A smart container using RFID tags for identity and related RFID sensors needs interworking of RFID 912 systems and sensor network systems.

913 6.10.3 Regulation compliance

914 6.10.3.1 Description
915 IoT systems, services, components and applications can be deployed in circumstances which require 916 adherence to a variety of laws, policies or regulations. Such support might be inherent in the IoT device 917 or system, or might require specific configuration, programming, modification or extension to ensure 918 compliance.
919 Additionally, there might be a range of different granularity or levels of abstraction at which the 920 regulations are applied or enforced.

921 6.10.3.2 Relevance to IoT systems
922 Regulations of relevance to IoT systems might take many forms, including regulations to assure 923 interoperability, to mandate or constrain functionality or capability, to assess the ability of the IoT 924 device or system to function in a certain usage context without causing damage, and to impose at least 925 minimal balance between contribution to the collective good and self-interest on the part of system 926 owners or operators.

927 6.10.3.3 Examples

928 Regulations which might apply to an IoT context include one or more of the following categories:

929

1) Safety regulations – These might include flight safety standards for IoT devices operating in

930

aircraft, or regulations covering the manufacture and sale of devices intended for consumer use

931

in the home, regulations for automotive systems, or regulations for devices or systems used in a

932

medical context.

933

2) RF related regulations – This category might include national or international regulations

934

governing RF emanations, adherence to frequency band restrictions, signal strength, spurious

935

signals (such as side channels, noise, or harmonics produced outside of the device’s nominal

936

frequency allocation), etc.

937

3) Consumer protection regulations– These might include national and international regulations

938

invoked whenever an IoT system involves a consumer anywhere in its operation.

939 In some IoT contexts, such as home automation, HVAC, etc. another layer of regulations might be 940 imposed in the form of building codes in various jurisdictions.

941 While the area is still developing, it is quite possible that at some point, there will be regulations 942 imposed or referenced by insurance companies as part of their risk models for pricing coverage of 943 structures, vehicles, systems, or businesses incorporating IoT systems and devices.

944 6.10.4 Scalability

945 6.10.4.1 Description
946 Scalability is the characteristic of a system to continue to work effectively as the size of the system, its 947 complexity or the volume of work performed by the system is increased.

24

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)

948 6.10.4.2 Relevance to IoT systems
949 IoT systems involve various elements such as devices, networks, services, applications, users, stored 950 data, data traffic, event reports. The amount of each of these elements can change over time and it is 951 important that the IoT system continues to function effectively when the amounts increase.
952 6.10.4.3 Examples
953 One example of scalability is when the number of sensor devices attached to an IoT system is increased. 954 If a system changes from monitoring temperature sensors in a single building to monitoring 955 temperature sensors on all buildings in a city there will be a significant increase in the volume of sensor 956 data flowing in the system, in the volume of data being stored in databases, in the number of devices 957 handled by the management system, and in the number of temperature readings processed by services 958 and applications.
959 6.10.5 Trustworthiness
960 6.10.5.1 Description
961 Trustworthiness is the degree to which a user or other stakeholder has confidence that a product or 962 system will behave as intended.
963 6.10.5.2 Relevance to IoT systems
964 Device, data and service trustworthiness is of utmost importance for IoT systems to ensure that only 965 trusted devices participate in the decision-making process of the system, resulting in the provision of 966 trustworthy applications. Device executable processes and data must be trusted to ensure that the 967 device/system operates as intended.
968 6.10.5.3 Examples
969 Where an IoT system that monitors the average measurement of a room taking the mean value reported 970 by x sensors, if y sensors report false values, due to a fault or malicious programming the resulting 971 mean measurement will be false. Detection, assessment and potential exclusion of anomalous readings 972 is necessary to ensure trustworthy data.

973 7 IoT CM

974 7.1 Main purpose

975 CM provides a common structure and definitions for describing the concepts of, and relationships 976 among, the entities within IoT systems. It must be generic, abstract and simple. In order to achieve this 977 goal, it is important to clarify the fundamentals of the IoT systems by asking the following questions:

978

1) What is the overall model of IoT entities and their relationships?

979

2) What are the key concepts in a typical IoT system?

980

3) What are the relationships between the entities, especially between digital entities and their

981

physical entities?

982

4) Who and where are the actors?

983

5) How the things and services collaborate via the network?

990 Figure 4 provides the overall model of all key IoT entities defined in this CM, their relationships and 991 their interactions. The IoT-User can be human (human user) or non-human (digital user) such as robots 992 or automation services, which act on behalf of human users. Digital user consumes services which are 993 interact through the communication network. A human user interacts using applications, which are a 994 specialized form of service. Some applications interact with other services via the network.

995 Physical entity here is the real-world thing which is controlled by an actuator or monitored by a sensor. 996 The physical entity may have an attached tag which is monitored by a sensor, rather than the physical 997 entity itself. A virtual entity represents a physical entity in the IT world. Both actuators and sensors are 998 kinds of IoT device. IoT devices interact through a network and can either communicate widely directly 999 or are connected with an IoT gateway which is capable of communicating widely.

Figure 5 – Entity and domain concepts of the CM

1006 1007 1008 1009 1010

Figure 5 shows entity and domain concepts of the CM. A thing with distinct and independent existence is called an entity, for example, a person, an organization, a device, a subsystem, or a group of such items. Everything in an IoT system is a kind of entity. In order to have a simple concept about IoT entities and their relationship, four fundamental entities are defined here, the thing (Physical Entity), the user (IoT-User), IT systems (Digital Entity) and the communication networks (Network).

1011 1012 1013 1014 1015 1016 1017

A digital entity is one of the computational and data elements of an IoT system, which includes applications, services, virtual entities, data stores, IoT devices and IoT gateways. An IoT-User is an entity which can be human or non-human, while a physical entity is discrete, identifiable and observable. A network is another important entity in the IoT system, through which other entities communicate with each other. Entities have an identity with an associated identifier, and identifiers are one way for a digital entity to get into communication with other digital entities through the network. There are many forms of identifier, which can vary depending on the nature of the entity.

1018 1019 1020 1021 1022 1023

When considering IoT systems, there is a need to decompose the system into smaller parts and group the elements with similar or common characteristics into what is termed a specific Domain. Each domain has its own boundary. Showing interaction between domains instead of between all the entities in a system can provide a simpler high level view of how the complex system works. Figure 6 shows that one IoT domain A interacts with another IoT domain B. Of course, one IoT domain can also interact with multiple IoT domains.

Figure 8 shows the identity concept in relation to Entities. Most entities in IoT especially physical entity (“Thing”) have an identity. An identifier is a dedicated, publicly known attribute or name for an identity. Typically, identifiers are valid within a specific context. An entity can have more than one identifier, but it requires at least one unique identifier within any identity context through which it can be accessed. For example, the identity information from a tag can be used as an Identifier to identify the physical entity to which it is attached.

Figure 9 shows how services, IoT devices and IoT gateways are connected through network. Service is an abstract concept. A service is implemented by one or more components. There could be multiple alternative implementations of the same service.

1071 1072 1073 1074

Entities which interact via networks do so by exposing one or more endpoints on a network A network connects endpoints. A service exposes zero or more endpoints by which it can be invoked. An endpoint has one or more network interfaces. Services, which are located remotely, can be reached by endpoints through network interfaces across a communication network.

1075 Data associated with services, with IoT device and with IoT gateway can be held in a data store used by 1076 that entity.

1077 7.3.3.1 Endpoint

of human users, for example in machine to machine interactions. A digital user interacts with one or more services directly or indirectly through its endpoint. A human user interacts through one or more applications. An application is a specialized form of service and can interact with other services.

1105 7.3.4.1 Human user
1106 A human user is person who uses an IoT system. A human user is a specialization of an IoT-User. A 1107 human user interacts across the network via an application.

1108 7.3.4.2 Digital user
1109 A digital user is a digital entity which uses an IoT system. A digital user is a specialization of an IoT-User. 1110 A digital user interacts with one or more services offered by the IoT system across the network.

1111 7.3.4.3 Application
1112 An application is a software component that offers a collection of functions with which a user can 1113 perform a task. An application is a service.

1117 1118 1119 1120 1121

Figure 11 shows the relationship between virtual entity, physical entity and IoT device. Actuator and sensor are IoT devices which have direct or indirect contact with a physical entity. An actuator operates on received digital information to act on (change) some property of a physical entity. A sensor perceives certain characteristics of a physical entity and transforms them into a digital representation which can be communicated. A physical entity may have one or more Tags attached to it and sensors can monitor

32

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)

1122 the tag rather than the physical entity itself. Actuator and sensor are kinds of IoT device, which converts 1123 variations in one physical quantity, quantitatively into variations in another.

1124 1125 1126

A smartphone, for example, can have a sensor to detect temperature of its surroundings. Another example is where a Bluetooth app on a smartphone communicates with an air conditioner to control the room temperature; the air conditioner is an actuator in this case.

1127 1128 1129 1130

Another example is where a smartphone has a barcode reading application – the application may have a locally installed database (local data store) to lookup the barcode information of a scanned object, or it might communicate with a remote service hosting a catalogue via the mobile network. The barcode itself is one form of a tag attached to a physical object.

1131 7.3.5.1 Sensor

1132 1133 1134

A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment and outputs digital data that can be transmitted over a network. A sensor is a specialization of an IoT device. A sensor monitors a physical entity.

1135 For IoT Device, see Clause 7.3.3.3.

1136 7.3.5.2 Actuator

1137 1138 1139

An actuator is a device that accepts digital inputs and which acts on (changes) one or more properties of a physical entity on the basis of those inputs. An actuator is a specialization of an IoT device. An actuator acts on a physical entity.

1140 For IoT device, see Clause 7.3.3.3.

1141 7.3.5.3 Virtual Entity
1142 A virtual entity is a digital representation of a physical entity, contained within a service. A virtual entity 1143 interacts through an endpoint. A virtual entity represents a physical entity.

1144 8 IoT RM and RA views

1145 8.1 Relation between CM, RMs and RAs

1146 1147 1148 1149 1150 1151 1152

A RM is an abstract framework for understanding significant relationships among the entities of an environment, and for the development of consistent standards or specifications supporting that environment. A RM is based on a small number of unifying concepts and can be used as a basis for education and explaining standards to a non-specialist. A RM is not directly tied to any standards, technologies or other concrete implementation details, but it does provide common semantics that can be used unambiguously across and between different implementations [SOURCE: OASIS SOA RM technical committee [1]].

1153 There are a number of concepts rolled up into that of a RM. The RM is abstract, and it provides 1154 information about environments of a certain kind.

1155 1156 1157 1158

A RM describes the type or kind of entities that may occur in such an environment, not the particular entities that actually do occur in a specific environment. A RM describes both types of entities or domains and their relationships. A list of entities, by itself, doesn't provide enough information to serve as a RM. A RM does not describe all entities in the framework; it can be used to clarify a specific instance.

33

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)

1159 1160 1161 1162 1163 1164

To be useful, a RM includes a clear description of the problem that it solves, and the concerns of the stakeholders who need the problem to be solved. A RM typically is intended and is technology agnostic; A RM does not make assumptions about the technology or platforms in place in a particular computing environment. A RM, typically, is intended to promote understanding of a class of problems, not to provide specific solutions for those problems. With respect to this, a RM aids the process of inventing and evaluating a variety of potential solutions in order to assist the practitioner.

1165 1166 1167

A RM is useful to: create standards for both the objects that inhabit the model and their relationships to one another; educate stakeholders; improve communication between people; create clear roles and responsibilities; and allow the comparison of different entities.

1168 1169 1170 1171 1172 1173 1174 1175 1176 1177 1178

The RA can be understood as contexts provided with common features, vocabulary, and requirements, together with supporting artefacts to enable their use. The artefacts are the description of the major foundational architecture components, which provide guidelines and constraints for instantiating solution architectures. The solution architectures can be defined not only from different viewpoints but also at many different levels of detail and abstraction; they consist of a list of entities and functions and some indication of the connections, interrelations and interactions with each other and with functions located outside of predefined architecture patterns representing the entities and functions. Figure 12 shows the architecture continuum from the CM through the entity-based RM and domain-based RM to a number of different views of the RA. The consistent architecture continuum should be maintained not only in this hierarchy (e.g., CM  RM  RA) but also in evolutionary updates over time; the architecture descriptions should be clearly documented.

Figure 13 – Entity-based IoT RM

1191 Starting the description of the IoT entity-based RM from the entities at the bottom of the diagram:

1192

1) Physical entities are the real-world things that are the essential part of an IoT system

1193 1194

2) Tags of various types can be attached to physical entities to aid in their monitoring and identification

1195

3) IoT devices connect the physical entities to the IoT system. IoT devices consist of:

1196 1197

a) sensors, which monitor or scan the physical entities to retrieve some information about them

1198 1199

b) actuators, which act on or change some properties of the physical entities based on digital instructions

1200 1201 1202 1203

4) IoT devices communicate via a network. It is common for IoT devices to communicate using a relatively short range and specialized proximity network, due to power and processing limitations. However, some devices are able to communicate at internet scale using an access network of some kind.

1204 1205 1206 1207 1208 1209 1210 1211 1212 1213

5) IoT Gateways are commonly used in IoT systems. They form a connection between the local proximity network(s) and the wide area access network. IoT Gateways can contain other entities and provide a wider range of capabilities. An IoT Gateway often contains a management agent, providing remote management capabilities. The IoT Gateway can contain a device data store, storing data from the associated IoT devices – this can either support local ("edge" or "fog") processing capabilities or be a means of dealing with intermittent communications networks. One or more analytics services can be supported by the IoT Gateway, typically operating on data streaming from the IoT devices or from the device data store. The IoT Gateway can also contain applications – these can be control applications, where rapid local processing is required to direct actuators based on input from sensors.

1214 1215 1216 1217

6) Applications & Services of various kinds exist in most IoT systems, with associated data stores. There is often a device data store, containing data derived from the IoT devices. There can be an analytics data store containing results from analytics services operating on device data and data from other sources. Analytics services of various types are usually present, processing device

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)

1218 1219 1220 1221 1222 1223

data and other data to derive insights. Process management is usually present, controlling processes associated with the IoT system. There are applications that reflect the capabilities of the IoT system itself. Finally, there are business services which provide capabilities related to the commercial use of the system, either by end users or by other external peer systems. The applications and services communicate with IoT Gateways and IoT devices using the access network, while they communicate with each other using the services network.

1224 1225 1226 1227 1228 1229 1230

7) Other applications, services and data stores are devoted to the operation and management of the IoT system itself. These include the device registry data store and an associated device identity service, which provides lookup capabilities for applications and services. There is a device management application, which provides monitoring and administration capabilities for the IoT devices in the system. There is an operational support system that provides various capabilities relating to the monitoring and management of the overall IoT system, including the offering of administration capabilities to users.

1231 1232 1233 1234 1235

8) Access to the capabilities of the IoT system for users is provided by the access & interchange entities, which provide controlled interfaces for service capabilities, for administration capabilities and for business capabilities. Which capabilities are provided depends on access control capabilities that vary depending on the user, requiring authentication and authorization before the capabilities can be used.

1236 1237 1238 1239 1240

9) Users of the IoT system can include both human users and digital users. Human users typically interact with the IoT system using some kind of user device. The user device can take many forms – including smart phones, personal computer, tablet or a more specialized device. In all cases, some form of application interface is offered to the human user, where the capabilities are supplied by an underlying application that interacts with the rest of the IoT system.

1241 1242 1243 1244 1245 1246

10) Digital systems can use IoT systems – providing for autonomic use of the system. Both user devices and digital users communicate with the rest of the IoT system via the user network, which can be the internet or can be other more specialized forms of network. For some IoT systems the user devices can interact directly with IoT devices or IoT Gateways. One of the common examples of such a system occurs with a smartphone or a wearable device, where the IoT devices and the user device are both part of a single device.

1247 1248

11) Peer systems, which can be other IoT systems or can be non-IoT systems, can be users of an IoT system and/or offer services to the IoT system.

1249 Peer systems interact with the IoT system through the user network – typically the internet.

1250 1251 1252

Security & privacy elements apply across the complete IoT system. These can include authentication, authorization, certificates, encryption, key management, logging and auditing, data protection such as anonymization and pseudonymization.

1253 1254 1255

Based on a study of the decomposition of various IoT systems in different application scenarios, Figure 14 shows the most common IoT entities found in IoT systems. Additionally, this figure provides a very high level relationship between Domain and Entity.

1260
1261 1262 1263 1264

8.2.2.1 Introduction
Figure 15 shows the domain representation of the IoT RM. The domain-based RM is composed of User Domain (UD), Operations & Management Domain (OMD), Application Service Domain (ASD), Resource & Interchange Domain (RID), Sensing & Controlling Domain (SCD), and Physical Entity Domain (PED). Each identified domain is mutually exclusive from all other domains.

The IoT system’s environment is mainly formed by the PED, but in certain situations, part of the SCD entities can be allotted as a part of the environment. Hardware (i.e. physical entities) and software (i.e. virtual entities) which appear in the domains other than the PED and the SCD support functions and capabilities of the domain to which they belong and they do not interact (e.g., sense and actuate) with an environment for which an IoT system is responsible and monitoring. The IoT system’s environment is mainly formed by the PED, but in certain situations, part of the SCD entities can be considered as a part of the environment. Hardware (i.e. physical entities) and software (i.e. virtual entities) which appear in domains other than the PED and the SCD support functions and capabilities of the domain to which they belong and they do not interact (e.g., sense and actuate) with the environment for which an IoT system is responsible and monitoring.

The IoT domain-based RM supports planning and organization of the diverse, expanding collection of interconnected networks. Interconnected networks provide communication connectivity, including data links. These can be point-to-point links in or between IoT systems, both inter- and intra-domain, and with other systems and organizations. The connected networks should maintain interoperability from one network to another. The network mainly provides pathways for communication and data exchange. Thus, the key role of the networks is to support and provide communication and data exchange activities and interactions. The types of the activities and interactions between two entities, between two domains, or between two IoT systems determine their relationships between the entities, domains, and IoT systems, respectively. Although the inter-domain communication networks are not specifically designated as part of one of the six domains, these networks play a critical role in an IoT system. Depending on the infrastructure of IoT systems, the inter-domain communication networks can be local area network, Internet, Intranet, enterprise backbone network, or wide area network, etc. Business-to-business (B2B) networks are also considered as inter-domain communication networks.

1290 8.2.2.1.1 The user domain (UD)
1291 Users are the stakeholders and actors of the UD. A user can be an individual person, a group of persons 1292 such as a household, a society, an organization or a government department.

1293
1294 1295 1296 1297

8.2.2.1.2 The physical entity domain (PED)
The PED consists of the physical and virtual entities in an IoT system. Therefore, the PED is the primary environment within which an IoT system is responsible for tasks or functions such as monitoring, sensing, and controlling. People can be one of the entities in the PED but while the owner of the PED is a stakeholder he may not be an entity in the PED.

1298 8.2.2.1.3 The sensing & controlling domain (SCD)

1299 1300 1301

The SCD is an essential domain in an IoT system because the SCD provides critical information about an environment (i.e. PED) to all the other domains of an IoT system. In addition, the SCD can manipulate the state of Physical Entities in the IoT system environment through actuation.

1302
1303 1304 1305 1306

8.2.2.1.4 The operations & management domain (OMD)
System operators and managers are the actors of the OMD. The operators and managers maintain the overall health of IoT systems. The OMD represents the collection of functions responsible for provisioning, managing, monitoring and optimization of the systems’ operational performance in realtime.

1307 8.2.2.1.5 The resource & interchange domain (RID)

1308 Organizations that participate in an IoT system are the stakeholders of the RID. These organizations can 1309 range from a coffee shop to utility companies or governmental organizations.

1310 1311 1312

The RID interacts with the external entities, applications, services, and systems in terms of resources. The resource can be physical, monetary, or digital depending on the transactions executed through the RID.

1313 1314 1315 1316 1317 1318 1319

From the perspective of the digital resources, the domain-based RM has an underlying data layer covering all six domains because the data is generated and consumed in a distributed fashion by all domains in the RM. In order to play its role, the RID needs access to the digital resources by permission of other domains (the UD, OMD, ASD, and SCD). Thus, this particular RID role can be viewed as the RID having a pseudo-information database domain. The actual data processing such as data “analytics” are performed typically in the ASD and the data after processing are stored in the service providers’ database. In the RID, additional data processing may be performed, if required, to accommodate the

38

© ISO/IEC CD 30141 – All rights reserved

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)

1320 external organizations. This additional processing may include data quality assurance, data 1321 transformation, distribution and storage.

1322 8.2.2.1.6 The application service domain (ASD)

1323 Application service providers are the actors of the ASD. Application service providers offer services to 1324 the IoT-User in the UD.

1325 1326 1327 1328 1329 1330

The ASD contains all types of service providers involved in an IoT system. Thus, the service providers interact not only with the users in the UD to fulfil their requests but also with entities in the SCD (i.e. sensors and actuators) to gain data from entities in the PED. Additionally, the ASD interacts with the OMD if an OMD stakeholder becomes a client of a service provider in the ASD. The service providers in the ASD are likely to interact with external organizations, such as other IoT systems and platforms, law enforcement, utilities, financial institutions, and governments, via the RID.

1331 The application service providers form a business domain within the ASD; the business domain 1332 functions enable end-to-end service operations of the IoT systems.

1333 8.2.3 Relation between entity-based RM and domain-based RM
1334 Taking the entity-based RM in Figure 13 and the domain-based RM in Figure 15, a mapping relation 1335 between the two RMs is shown in Figure 16, where these two RMs are consistent with each other.

IoT devices and IoT gateway are entities in sensing and controlling domain. Physical entity exists in physical entity domain.

1344 8.3 IoT RA views

1345 1346

8.3.1 General description The IoT RA is described by the following five RA views:

1347

1) IoT RA functional view

1348

2) IoT RA system view

1349

3) IoT RA communications view

1350

4) IoT RA information view

1351

5) IoT RA usage view

1352 1353 1354

The IoT RA becomes an application- or service-specific system architecture or a target system architecture when the RA is tailored to a specific set of requirements. Examples of specific systems are: agricultural system, environmental system, smart grid system, smart home/building, smart city, etc.

1355
1356 1357 1358

8.3.2 IoT RA functional view
The functional view is a technology-agnostic view of the functions necessary to form an IoT system. The functional view describes the distribution of and dependencies among functions for support of activities described in the user view, and addresses the following concepts:

1359

1) Intra-domain functions

1360

2) Cross-domain functions

1361 1362 1363 1364 1365

Each functional component is realized by one or more implementations of actual system components, which may be deployed to form a working system. Figure 20 shows the decomposition of the IoT RA functional components. In this figure, there are two parts: intra-domain functions and cross-domain functions. The functional components are not necessary for some specific applications and therefore, in their corresponding IoT system, may not exist.

1366 8.3.2.1 Intra-domain functions

1367 As shown at left side of the figure, the intra-domain and cross domain functions are depicted as follows:

Figure17 – IoT RA functional view –decomposition of IoT RA functional components

1370 8.3.2.1.1 The sensing & controlling domain (SCD)

1371 The SCD is comprised of a set of common functional components whose implementation complexity 1372 depends on the infrastructure of IoT systems.

1373 1374 1375

1) Sensing is the function that reads sensor data from sensors. Its implementation spans hardware, firmware, device drivers, and software elements. Recursive sensing requires control and actuation, and thus has tighter requirements than the rest of the control system.

1376 1377 1378

2) Actuation is the functional component that writes data and control signals to an actuator to effect the actuation. Its implementation may span hardware, firmware, device drivers and software elements.

1379 1380

3) Execution is the function that executes logic which controls states, conditions, and behaviour of the system and its environment, in accordance with control objectives.

1381 1382

4) Identification is an essential function in a system which enables the entities to be identifiable and traceable, so that the system can distinguish an entity from others.

1383 1384 1385 1386 1387 1388

5) Network Access mechanisms are functions that enable connection between sensors, actuators, controllers, gateways, and other edge systems. Networks take different forms, such as a bus (local to an underlying system platform or remote), or networked architecture (hierarchical, hubs and spokes, meshed, point-to-point), some statically configured, and others dynamically. QoS characteristics such as latency, bandwidth, jitter, reliability, and resilience must be taken into account.

1389 1390 1391

6) Local Modelling functions support understanding the states, conditions and behaviours of the systems under control and those of peer systems by interpreting and correlating data gathered from sensors and peer systems.

1392 1393 1394

7) Asset Management functions enables operations management of the control systems including system configuration, policy, system, software/firmware updates and other lifecycle management operations. Note that it is subservient to the executor so as to ensure that policies

41

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)

1395 1396

(such as safety and security) are always under the responsibility and authority of the edge entity.

1397 1398 1399 1400

A stakeholder is an owner or owners of the SCD, yet, this stakeholder may not show up as an entity in the SCD. The SCD could have data/processing platform and various kinds of virtual objects supporting the entities in the SCD. Thus, actors in the SCD can be physical entities (e.g., sensors, controllers, actuators, computers, etc.) or virtual entities (e.g., software).

1401
1402 1403 1404

8.3.2.1.2 The application service domain (ASD)
The ASD domain represents the collection of functions implementing application logic that realizes specific business functionalities for the service providers in the ASD. The application service domain has components such as logic and rules, functional components, APIs and portal functional component.

1405 8.3.2.1.3 The operation & management domain (OMD)

1406 1407 1408 1409 1410 1411

The OMD represents the collection of functions responsible for life cycle management, business support, security and safety management, and regulation management. The management functions enable management centres to issue a suite of management commands to the control systems or the corresponding devices. The life cycle management provides several types of functional components for the IoT system operations: provisioning, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, prognostics, diagnostics, optimization, billing, etc.

1412 1413 1414

1) Provisioning and deployment functions include of a set of functions required to configure, onboard, register, and track assets, and to deploy and retire assets from operations. These functions must be able to provision and bring assets online remotely, securely and at scale.

1415

2) Monitoring and diagnostics functions enable detection and identification of problems.

1416 1417 1418
1419 1420 1421

3) Prognostics functional component consists of a set of functions that serve as a predictive analytics engine of the IoT system. The main goal is to identify potential issues before they occur and provide recommendations on their mitigation.
4) Optimization functional component consists of a set of functions that improve asset reliability and performance, reduce energy consumption, and increase availability and output in correspondence to how the assets are used.

8.3.2.1.4 The resource & interchange domain (RID)
The main functional components are resource management, analytics, resource interchange, access control, and so on. The IoT resource, which can be shared within an IoT system or with other IoT systems, could be intelligence, knowledge, information, data, etc. The IoT resource & interchange domain performs interchange of the IoT resource for the whole IoT system with other systems. Moreover, stakeholders in the RID need to provide, and be provided with, data regarding the IoT system, analyse the resource data and receive analyses, and store data in the cloud.

1430 1431 1432

8.3.2.1.5 The user domain (UD)
The main function of the UD is to provide access to IoT services and information on how to use them. Here the functional components are users and HMIs which provides the interface for user to access, subscribe and receive the services provided by the application service domain.

8.3.2.1.6 The physical entity domain (PED)
PED has sensed physical objects and controlled physical objects which are the subject of functions in other domains.

1436 8.3.2.2 Cross-Domain functions

1437 1438 1439 1440 1441

Figure shows cross-domain functions which are functions exist all six domains as described in the domain-based IoT RM. These functions include security, safety, resilience, trust and privacy, connectivity, interoperability, dynamic composition and automated interoperability, etc. Each function can include functional components in different domains and be expanded in the functional domain decomposition as illustrated below.

1442 1443

1) The privacy function is realized through the data privacy protection in the sensing and transmission, API & portals, monitoring, information resource interchange and HMI etc.

1444 1445 1446 1447 1448 1449 1450

2) The security function refers to the ability of IoT system to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and confirmation of the exchanged information. The IoT RA integrates security policies for IoT components as key part of system design. For example, asset management in the SCD enables operations management including system configuration, policy, software and firmware updates and other lifecycle management operations. In the RID, access control and the resource management are responsible for data security, data access control and data rights management.

1451 1452 1453 1454

3) The safety and resilience function is a superset of fault tolerance and closely related to autonomic computing capabilities of self- healing, self-configuring, self-organizing and selfprotecting, e.g., the IoT component can take advantage of the hierarchical network to do selfoptimization.

1455 1456 1457 1458 1459 1460

4) The trust & privacy function is to distinguish different levels of trust for a party (e.g., application, system, network, etc.) during data transmission or exchange in order to protect the confidentiality of data. Usually, validation is required before the trust is established and trust can be enhanced by reputation-based approaches. Privacy may be achieved mostly via authentication. To prevent leaking of confidential data, additional data access rules may be used to meet necessary requirements for data requisition, removal, encryption, etc.

1461 1462 1463

5) The connectivity function provides the capability of heterogeneous integration for IoT components, which may belong to different networks or using different technologies, to achieve seamless connection of each entity.

1464 1465 1466 1467 1468

6) The interoperability function provides the capability to exchange information of an IoT system with a common interpretation of information. Basically, two levels of data interoperability are considered. Syntactic interoperability is to exchange information in a common data format with a common protocol to structure the data. Semantics interoperability is to interpret the meaning of the symbols in the messages correctly.

1469 1470 1471 1472

7) The dynamic composition & automated interoperability function provides a flexible method of composing services so that the IoT components can be dynamically integrated at run-time to enable adaptable services. Semantic interoperability is required to support the dynamic composition.

1473 1474

8) Privacy is achieved mostly via confidentiality. To prevent data leakage and satisfy privacy requirements access rules may be used for data requisition, removal, encryption, etc.

In Figure 18, IoT RA system view is shown together with all the entities involved in each domain and the connections between them. The entities in each domain are very general and optional, depending on specific applications. There are four different kinds of networks to connect the physical components in the six domains of an IoT system: proximity network, access network, services network, and user network. More detailed description about these four networks will be introduced in 8.3.4 IoT RA communications view.

1494
1495 1496 1497 1498

8.3.3.1 Systems/sub-systems in physical entity domain (PED)
In the PED, there are no devices or sub-systems. Instead, it mainly consists of sensed physical objects and controlled physical objects, which are related to IoT applications and are of interested to users. A sensed physical object is a physical entity from which information is acquired by sensors, while a controlled physical object is a physical entity which is subject to actions of actuators.

ISO/IEC CD 30141:2016(E)

1499 8.3.3.2 Systems/sub-systems in sensing & controlling domain (SCD)

1500 1501 1502

In the SCD, the local entities consist primarily of sensors, actuators, and IoT gateways and endpoints. Sensors and actuators act upon physical entities, while IoT gateways connect the SCD to communications channels.

1503 1504 1505 1506

Sensors acquire information from the sensed physical object, e.g., physical, chemical, biological properties, etc. Actuators perform operations on controlled physical objects through controlling function units. Both sensors and actuators can act upon physical objects independently or collaboratively.

1507 1508 1509 1510

IoT gateways are devices which connect SCD with other domains. IoT Gateways provide functions such as protocol conversion, address mapping, data processing, information fusion, certification, and equipment management. IoT gateways can be either independent equipment or be integrated with other sensing and controlling devices.

1511 The SCD might also include some local control systems such as Asset Management, Executor, etc., 1512 depending on the complexity of the IoT system infrastructure.

1513 8.3.3.3 Systems/sub-systems in application service domain (ASD)

1514 In the ASD, there are basic service system and business service system.

1515 1516 1517

A basic service system provides fundamental data services, which include data access, data processing, data fusion, data storage, identity resolution, geographic information service, user management, and inventory management, etc.

1518 1519 1520 1521

A business service system is responsible for realization of traditional or new Internet specific types of business functions. The business functions include enterprise resource management (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), asset management, service lifecycle management, billing, payment processing, human resource activities, work planning and scheduling systems.

1522
1523 1524 1525 1526 1527

8.3.3.4 Systems/sub-systems in operation & management domain (OMD)
The OMD includes operation systems and regulation management systems. Operation systems are responsible for management of IoT devices and control of the operation of the IoT system, enabling the equipment and systems operate safely and reliably. Regulation management systems act to ensure that the IoT system complies with relevant laws and regulations. They provide monitoring, supervision and execution of relevant laws and regulations.

1528 8.3.3.5 Systems/sub-systems in user domain (UD)

1529 1530 1531

In the UD, users can be human or digital. Both of them interact with other domains via the user interface device, which has an added HMI for the human user. The devices in the UD are the HMI and the user interface device.

1532 8.3.3.6 Systems/sub-systems in IoT resource and interchange domain (RID)

1533 In the RID, there are three major sub-systems:

1534 1535 1536

1) Resource management system: This system stores and processes the resources. The resources can be divided into two types. The first is for interior usage, the second is to be shared to and from the external systems.

1537

2) Interchange system: This system executes the interchange of the resources.

© ISO/IEC CD 30141 – All rights reserved

45

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)

1538 1539 1540

3) Access management system: This system controls access to stored resources in RID and any other resources within an IoT system. The RID serves as a bridge between an IoT system and the outside world.

1541 The working procedure of the systems in the RID is described as follows.

1542
1543 1544 1545 1546 1547 1548 1549 1550 1551

Case 1:
When the external systems require resources from an IoT system, including data, financial transaction, etc., they first send request to the Interchange Systems in the RID. Then Interchange System forwards the request to the Access Management System, which decides whether to accept this request. If accepted, it authorizes the ASD, SCD or other domains to provide relevant resources, which are sent back to the resource management system for data format conversion, data fusion, etc. Then the data management system transmits those requested resources to the interchange system, which acts as an interface between the IoT system and external systems. If not accepted, the access management system directly sends a response of "No" to the interchange system, which says "No" to the request from the external systems.

1552
1553 1554 1555 1556 1557 1558 1559 1560

Case 2:
When the IoT system requires some resources from external systems, it first sends a request to the access management system in the RID for access authority. After that, the access is authorized and the AMS sends a resource interchange request to the interchange system in the RID, which forwards this request to the external systems. If the interchange system gets positive response, it delivers relevant resources and stores them in the data management system in the RID. Then the data management system further forwards the resources to the originator of the request in the interior IoT system, such as the ASD or SCD. If the Interchange System receives negative response, it delivers this message to the originator of the request.

1561 8.3.4 IoT RA communications view

1562 8.3.4.1 Communications networks

1563 1564 1565

The IoT RA communications view describes the principal communications networks which are involved in IoT systems and the entities with which they connect. The four principal communications networks are shown in Figure 19.

1566 1567

Figure 19 – IoT RA communications view

1568 8.3.4.1.1 Proximity network

1569 1570 1571 1572

This network exists within the Sensing and Controlling domain. Its main task is to connect the sensors and actuators to gateway. Proximity networks are typically local and limited in range, largely necessary because sensors and actuators are low power, or are in locations that make wide area connections (such as the internet) difficult or impossible to provide.

1573 Proximity networks may use specialized protocols and may not use IP.

1574 1575 1576

Proximity networks often uses low power limited range wireless and wired technologies. Current examples include IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, NarrowBand IoT.

1577 1578 1579

Individual sensors and actuators may have limited power and limited hardware capabilities, which means that simple, local, and low-power networks are needed to connect them to gateways. These are more powerful and can in turn connect to access networks.

1580 Proximity networks may involve the use of an address translation capability to translate between their 1581 local addressing schemes and addressing schemes used on access networks.

1582
1583 1584 1585 1586 1587 1588

8.3.4.1.2 Access network
Access networks are typically wide area networks connecting devices in the SCD to the other domains – the ASD and the OMD. Access Network typically connects to gateways, but When Sensors and Actuators are more capable, they may connect directly to Access Networks (dashed lines in Figure 22). A range of technologies can be used in access networks including wired connections (Broadband / ADSL / Fiber) and wireless connections including Wireless LANs (Wi-Fi), Mobile (cellular) networks and Satellite links (particularly for remote locations). Access Networks typically use IP. Access networks may involve the

47

ISO/IEC 30141:2016(E)

1589 use of a device registry that holds data about the IoT devices associated with the IoT system and how to 1590 communicate with them.

1591 8.3.4.1.3 Services network

1592 1593 1594 1595

This network connects elements within and between the ASD, the RID, and the OMD. This network can include both Internet elements and also (private) intranet elements. It is typical for intranet networks to be used where the elements of the other domains exist within a single data center. Services networks typically use IP.

1596 1597 1598 1599

Service Networks connect the applications and services in the ASD, the RID and the OMD, which are typically wired networks within data centers, running IP-based protocols. Where communication spans multiple data centers, a variety of network technologies may be used, including both dedicated connections and Internet connections.

1600 8.3.4.1.4 User network

1601 This network connects the User domain with the ASD and OMD. It also connects Peer IoT Systems and 1602 non-IoT systems with the RID. This network is typically based on public Internet elements and uses IP.

1603 1604 1605

User Networks connect to user devices, to peer IoT systems and to other non-IoT systems, which can be internet-based. Such networks can use any of the technologies commonly used to carry internet traffic, including both wired and wireless systems.

1606 8.3.4.2 Communication networks implementation

1607 1608 1609 1610

Each of the principal communications networks can be implemented by means of a range of different network technologies, which are used depending on the particular characteristics and requirements of the IoT system. IoT system implementations may use multiple instances of each of these networks to create complete solutions.

1611 1612 1613

In Figure , the user domain is shown spanning both the user network and the access network. This describes those cases where user devices and their applications connect directly to the SCD, for example when the user device is a smart phone which contains sensors.

1614 8.3.5 IoT RA information view

1615 8.3.5.1 General description

1616 The information is generated by using, monitoring, controlling and analysing connected entities.

1617 1618 1619

Some information is static, e.g. identifier of an entity, while other information may be variable, e.g. location of an entity. Some static information is also key for associating variable information to an entity. Some information may also be static as information but variable in its usage.

1620 1621 1622 1623

Both raw and processed information is used by application (service), operator, manager, administrator, customers, users, etc. to fulfil intended task for a given activity in an IoT system. The information can stay within a “domain” or be exchanged between “domains”. Figure 20 illustrates some examples of data which are stored in relevant domains.

Figure 32 shows an example of using an IoT service across vertical sectors. This example is related to consumers and the product manufacturing industry (vehicle manufacturing). End user A represents the customer who is the owner of a new car. End user B represents an engineer or designer in the vehicle industry.

1762

1) Sensors installed in the car can provide the vehicle run time status data.

1763 1764

2) IoT services perform analytics and inform the driver of defects (e.g. low coolant levels) or a need for inspection.

1765 1766

3) Such customer car usage data together with millions of other customer’s car usage data can be sent to a centralised manufacturers’ database through a resource interchange interface.

1767 1768 1769 1770 1771 1772

Based on the data collected from the customer end user B can get real-time information of car usage, and identify which mechanical or electrical part needs maintenance, replacement or is not working reliable. End user B can aggregate the real-time information with other data and further analyse potential reasons for the problem. Such information may also improve the design of components or help in the design of better quality new cars. Roles and activities during the IoT product life cycle (can be moved into Annex later)

1773 1774 1775 1776

IoT services can be used by all vertical sectors to support and transform every part of the business. Generally, they can be considered as a kind of enablement platform, which improves operations, or lowers the cost, or creates new products and business models, or drives engagement and customer experiences.

1777 Figure 33 shows roles and activities involved when existing systems create, develop, operate and finally 1778 decommission IoT services.

Interpreting model diagram

1785 In this document, UML Class diagrams have the following restrictions:

1786

1) Concepts are represented as UML Classes with no attributes.

1787

2) The documentation for each concept is the definition of the concept.

1788 Only two kinds of associations are used:

1789 1790

1) Generalization (an “is-a” relationship): For example, a sensor is an IoT device. This generalization relationship can be expressed as shown in Figure A.1:

Sensor

IoT Dev ice is a

1791
1792
1793 1794 1795

Figure A.1 – Generalization
2) Directed association expresses relationship between concepts. These association names are verbs. Figure A.2 expresses the association relationship that the Sensor monitors the Physical Entity (the thing).

1798 Cardinality constrains on association ends are not shown. They vary from one kind of association to 1799 another, but can be inferred from the descriptions in the following clauses.

1800 1801 1802

If a concept, which is a generalization of a concept on the diagram, is not itself shown on the diagram, the name of that generalized concept appears in italics at the top right corner of the box as shown in Figure A.2 (“Entity” and “IoT device”).

Figure A.3 shows how one IoT system can be combined with another. The arrows in the figure represent the communication and data exchange between the IoT systems, which is enabled by the RID in each IoT system. This is illustrated by one IoT System connecting to another, e.g., IoT Systems A, B and C in Figure A.3.

Figure A.3 – Integration of an IoT system with others In Figure A.4, an overall IoT infrastructure is presented from a system point of view. It illustrates how various types of IoT systems in vertical ASDs can be integrated for interoperability through IoT platforms at different organizational levels (e.g. national, provincial, corporation, enterprise or global.).

1861 1862 1863

Additionally, one IoT system can directly interact with other IoT systems when both mutually benefit from the direct interaction. Furthermore, an IoT system can access services implemented on external, third party, systems such as banking and financial services, medical services, billing services, etc.

1864 The lines in Figure A.4 represent network connectivity, and the grey circles represent interoperable 1865 access points (e.g., IoT gateways).
