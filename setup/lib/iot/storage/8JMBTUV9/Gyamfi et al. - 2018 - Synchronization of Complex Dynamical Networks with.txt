Abstract—This paper investigates the synchronization problem of complex dynamical networks (CDNs) with randomly occurring coupling and time-varying delay. A suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is formulated. Utilizing the well known extended Jensen’s integral inequality and the properties of Bernoulli random variables, uncertainties in exchange of information within the networks is modeled. Sufﬁcient delay dependent synchronization conditions are derived and nonfragile controllers proposed in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, an example is provided to indicate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.
Index Terms—Complex dynamical networks (CDNs), extended Jensen’s integral inequality, nonfragile controllers, synchronization.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the last few years, the spearheading works of Watts and Strogatz in [1], which investigated complex networks have gained much attention as a results of its theoretical relevance and potential applications in most signiﬁcant real world networks such as transportation networks, communication networks, social networks, biological networks, electric power grids and others [2]–[4]. A signiﬁcant number of these networks display complexities in their entire topological and dynamic properties. One of the noteworthy and intriguing phenomena in complex dynamical systems is synchronization, which means the network nodes converge to a common state of behavior. The implementation of synchronization of chaotic system for communications are mainly dependent on robustness of the synchronization prevailing between the transmitters and receivers [5] . A great deal of useful and effective methodologies for CDNs synchronization have been proposed [6]–[10]. Control inputs are to ensure the robustness and stability with regards to network parameters hence, the numerous designed control strategies which require precise controllers. Accordingly, the designed control strategy requires precision of system parameters, which may not be generally conceivable in practical sense because of limited processing of information speed and round - off errors in numerical computation by computers. Based on these, it is important to ensure the outlined controllers do have the capacity to endure some ﬂuctuations in their parameters for synchronization

problems of CDNs. Controller fragility must be considered while implementing the designed controllers in practical applications, which inspired the nonfragile control problems been researched in [11], [12]. Furthermore, time delay is inevitable in numerous CDNs as a result of ﬁnite speed of information transmission which can eventually degrades the network’s performance or destroys the perceived synchronization and stability [7], [13], [14]. Motivated by the above exposition, a nonfragile control scheme is designed for a delay dependent CDNs with randomly occurring coupling for synchronization problem in this paper. Also, an appropriate Lyapunov Krasovskii functional is constructed and applying the extended Jensen’s integral inequality guaranteed less conservativeness from the derived delay dependent conditions. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notations: The notations considered in this paper are standard. I and 0 represent identity and zero matrices with appropriate dimensions, Rn implies the n-dimensional Euclidean space, Rm×n represents the set of all m × n real matrices. , respectively. P > 0 means P is a real symmetric and positive deﬁnite matrix. The superscript ”T” indicates matrix transposition. ∗ represent the symmetric elements beneath the main diagonal of a symmetric matrix and diag{....} representing a blockdiagonal matrix. When a matrix dimension is not stated, it is assumed to have a compatible dimension. A ⊗ B indicate the Kronecker product of matrices A and B.

Note: g(ei(t)) ≡ f (xi(t)) − f (sˆ(t)) and g(ei(t − γ(t))) ≡ f (xi(t − γ(t))) − f (sˆ(t − γ(t))).
Consider the designed nonfragile feedback control to ensure synchronization in the following form:

ui(t) = (ki+σ(t) ki(t))e(t)+kτie(t−γ(t)), i = 1, 2, . . . , N.
(6) ki, kτi ∈ Rn×n are the control feedback gain matrices to be estimated with ki been the controller gain ﬂuctuation. The

ki(t) ≡ HiΥ˜ i(t)Wi

where Υ˜ i(t) ∈ Rk×l, i = 1, 2, . . . , N as an unknown time-varying matrix satisfying the following: Υ˜ i(t)T Υ˜ i(t) ≤ I, Hi and Wi are known constant matrices. σ(t) is a stochastic variable describing the randomly occurring controller gain ﬂuctuations. This satisﬁes the Bernoulli distribution and is deﬁned as:

σ(t) = 1 Occurrence of control gain ﬂuctuations, (8) 0 No control gain ﬂuctuations

with stochastic probability variable of σ(t) being given as:

P r{σ(t) = 1} = σ, P r{σ(t) = 0} = 1 − σ; σ ∈ [0, 1]

The control input is substituted into the error dynamics (5)

Theorem III.2. For given scalars δ, σ ∈ [0, 1], γ1, γ2, and µ < 1, the CDNs synchronization can be realized,
with the existence of symmetric positive deﬁnite matrices P = diag{P¯1, P¯2, . . . , P¯N }, Sˆ = diag{Sˆ1, Sˆ2, . . . , SˆN } and matrices Y1 = diag{Y11, Y21, . . . , YN1 } ∈ RnN×nN and Y2 = diag{Y12, Y22, . . . , YN2 } ∈ RnN×nN with a scalar ε > 0, hence Ω¯ < 0, where

IV. NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATION

We consider an isolated standard Chua’s circuit as an unforced node of CDNs been described by the following state equations as a special case of (1) when, A= B2 = 0, B1 = I3 and δ= 0.5. The standard Chua’s circuit is normalized and transformed to:

x˙ 1 =a(x2 − m1x1 + ϕ¯)

x˙ 2 =x1 − x2 + x3

(24)

x˙ 3 = − ˜bx2

Let a =10, ¯b =14.87 and ϕ¯(x1) = σ˜1x1 + 0.5(σ˜2 − σ˜1)ψ¯(x1)

where σ˜1= -0.68, σ˜2= -1.27, and ψ¯(x1) = (|x1 + 1| − |x1 − 1|).

The coupled Chua’s circuits is used modeled the

case of transmitter and receivers employed in secure

communication [5]. The initial conditions of CDNs are

chosen as x1(0) = [1, −2, 8]T , x2(0) = [4, −6, 4]T , x3(0) = [1, −1, 7]T ,and s(0) = [0, −1, 1]T .The state error trajectories

without control input is depicted in Fig.(1). Applying the

controller gain matrices, the state error trajectories of

(9) converges to zero which indicate the synchronization

of the transmitter and receivers when considering secure

communication for signal transmission as shown in Fig. (2).

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the nonfragile synchronization control problem for a CDNs with randomly occurring coupling and timevarying delay is investigated. Nonfragile controllers have been designed and introduced to the CDNs which ensured the desired synchronization. The extended Jensen’s inequality is used
