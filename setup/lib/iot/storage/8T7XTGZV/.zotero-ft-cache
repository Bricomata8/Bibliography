Abstract: The Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) is an important metric of wireless communication link quality. SINR estimates have several important applications. These include optimizing the transmit power level for a target quality of service, assisting with handoff decisions and dynamically adapting the data rate for wireless Internet applications. Accurate SINR estimation provides for both a more efﬁcient system and a higher user-perceived quality of service. In this paper, we develop new SINR estimators and compare their mean squared error (MSE) performance. We show that our new estimators dominate estimators that have previously appeared in the literature with respect to MSE. The sequence of transmitted bits in wireless communication systems consists of both pilot bits (which are known both to the transmitter and receiver) and user bits (which are known only by the transmitter). The SINR estimators we consider alternatively depend exclusively on pilot bits, exclusively on user bits, or simultaneously use both pilot and user bits. In addition, we consider estimators that utilize smoothing and feedback mechanisms. Smoothed estimators are motivated by the fact that the interference component of the SINR changes relatively slowly with time, typically with the addition or departure of a user to the system. Feedback estimators are motivated by the fact that receivers typically decode bits correctly with a very high probability, and therefore user bits can be thought of as quasipilot bits. For each estimator discussed, we derive an exact or approximate formula for its MSE. Satterthwaite approximations, noncentral F distributions (singly and doubly) and distribution theory of quadratic forms are the key statistical tools used in developing the MSE formulas. In the case of approximate MSE formulas, we validate their accuracy using simulation techniques. The approximate MSE formulas, of interest in their own right for comparing the quality of the estimators, are also used for optimally combining estimators. In particular, we derive optimal weights for linearly combining an estimator based on pilot bits with an estimator based on user bits. The optimal weights depend on the MSE of the two estimators being combined, and thus the accurate approximate MSE formulas can conveniently be used. The optimal weights also depend on the unknown SINR, and therefore need to be estimated in order to construct a useable combined estimator. The impact on the MSE of the combined estimator due to estimating the weights is examined. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 51: 720 –740, 2004.

1. INTRODUCTION

In all communication systems, noise generated by circuit components in the receiver is a source of signal corruption. The ratio of the signal power to noise power, called the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR), is an important indicator of communication link quality. In wireless communications systems (particularly in mobile cellular communication systems) interference from other users in the system is a more signiﬁcant source of signal corruption than the noise from circuitry. An adjusted indicator of link quality is the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Traditionally, a target link quality is characterized by a tolerable bit error rate that, in turn, maps to a required SINR. The SINR is then used to determine the transmitter power, which will deliver the target link quality. The SINR is also utilized by various control actions in wireless communication systems including handoff decisions and data rate adaptation algorithms (see, for example, Furuskar, Mazur, Muller, and Olofsson [4] and Viterbi [19]). We set the context for SINR estimation by ﬁrst outlining the essential elements of a generic wireless communication system depicted in Figure 1.
An information source outputs an analog (e.g., voice) or digital signal (e.g., data) to a source encoder. The source encoder digitizes the signal, if needed, and typically performs bit compression. The resultant bits are passed to a channel encoder that introduces controlled redundancy (e.g., parity bits) to protect against channel errors. The modulator then maps ﬁxed-size subsets of the bits into one of a ﬁnite number of amplitude and/or phase combinations that get impressed on a carrier waveform. The resultant carrier waveform is transmitted through the atmosphere (i.e., through a channel) that randomly attenuates the strength of the signal and shifts its phase. At the receiver, the demodulator is a matched ﬁlter that tries to recover the amplitude and/or the phase of the transmitted carrier waveform by “matching” the received signal to the known combinations of amplitude and/or phase that are being used by the modulator at the transmitter. The goal of the demodulator is to undo the random effects of the channel and predict the transmitted bits. It is at the output of the demodulator that SINR estimation is undertaken.
Generally, wireless transmission is organized by time slots wherein some pilot bits (i.e., overhead bits that are known a priori to both the transmitter and the receiver) are sent followed by user bits (i.e., information bits that are known to the transmitter only). Pilot bits allow the receiver to learn the channel attenuation/phase shift and then undo their effect from the user bits, and are also used in maintaining synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver. As the pilot bits are pure overhead, their number relative to the number of user bits in a time slot is small. With an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) model for the noise and interference (Proakis [10]), the output of the demodulator (measured in volts) corresponding to the jth bit of the ith time slot is
Yij ϭ aij␮i ϩ ⑀ij, i Ն 1, j ϭ 1, . . . , N,
where aij is Ϫ1 or ϩ1 depending on whether the bit sent was 0 or 1, respectively (assuming Binary Phase Shift Keying), ␮i is an unknown constant during the ith time slot that is a function of the channel attenuation, ⑀ij are independent and identically distributed Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance ␴i2, and N is the number of bits in a time slot. In cases

of very fast fading, N may need to be small in order for the assumption that ␮i is constant during the time slot to hold. The ⑀ij in the AWGN model represent the effect of noise introduced by
the receiver as well as interference from other radio transmissions in the area. The Gaussian

assumption for ⑀ij will hold in CDMA systems provided the processing gain is sufﬁcient.

and

that

to estimate. For certain applications, such as handoff decisions and slow rate adaptation (e.g.,

GSM GPRS), SINR is alternatively deﬁned using an average value of ␮i over several adjacent time slots. Estimation methods discussed in Brandao [1], Turkboylari and Stuber [18], and

Ramakrishna et al. [11] are more suitable in those contexts than the methods that are discussed

here. Applications where our estimation methods apply include power control and fast rate

adaptation [e.g., systems such as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), Third

Generation Evolution Data Only (3G1x-EVDO), and Third Generation Evolution Data and

Voice (3G1x-EVDV)], where it is desired to track the short-term fading as much as possible.

The aij values in AWGN model are determined by the bit stream, and as such are known by
the transmitter. The receiver uses the demodulator output value for each bit to predict aij and then map that value (Ϫ1 or ϩ1) to a predicted bit value (0 or 1). The receiver knows the position

of pilot bits within a time slot and it also knows that for pilot bits aij ϵ 1. Let n denote the number of pilot bits in a time slot (implying m ϭ N Ϫ n user bits), and let Pij and Uij denote the demodulator output values for pilot and user bits, respectively. It follows that, for i Ն 1 and

Moreover,

the

are mutually independent. The distribution of Uij is a mixture of two Gaussian distributions that each have variance ␴i2 but have respective means of Ϫ␮i and ␮i, respectively, since aij in this

case is a random variable taking on each of the values Ϫ1 and ϩ1 with probability 0.5.

It is clear that the pilot bits provide an opportunity to estimate ␪i. In particular, letting P៮ i ϭ

estimator, its drawback is that n is typically small with the consequence being that the mean

squared error (MSE) of ␪ˆ iPI is too large for most applications. In Section 2 we consider

estimation of ␪i based exclusively on pilot bits and show that ␪ˆ iPI is dominated in terms of MSE by its bias-corrected version. In Section 3 we consider estimation of ␪i based on user bits. We ﬁrst review an ad hoc approach for using user bits that exists in the literature and then develop a novel estimator that uses the aˆ ij predictions as part of a feedback loop to improve upon ␪ˆ iPI. In Section 4 we develop further improvements by combining estimators of ␪i that are based on pilot and user bits, respectively. In particular, we derive weights to use in the context of forming
a weighted average of the two estimators. In Section 5 we discuss the use of variance-smoothing
techniques as an alternative to effectively increase the number of bits available for estimating
the SINR. Utilizing both variance-smoothing and combining, we present a very precise SINR
estimator. We use MSE as the criteria for evaluating the alternative estimators and derive
approximate expressions for the MSE for nearly all of the estimators proposed in this paper.
Simulations are used to validate the assumptions underlying the approximation arguments. An
overview of the simulation study is provided in an Appendix.

2. ESTIMATORS USING PILOT BITS

We ﬁrst consider the MSE properties of ␪ˆ iPI, some of which have been detailed in Thomas

[16].

First,

note

that

has

a

distribution

(see,

for

example,

Searle

[15],

Section 2.4i) with numerator and denominator degrees of freedom equal to 1 and n Ϫ 1

respectively, and a noncentrality parameter equal to ␭i ϭ n␪i/ 2. Using the formulas in Searle

[15] for the mean and variance of the noncentral F distribution, it follows that

The estimator ␪ˆ iPI is a scaled version of the maximum likelihood estimator of SINR derived by Thomas [16]. A bias-corrected (BC) estimator of ␪i can be formed by linearly transforming ␪ˆ iPI. Indeed,

The Lehman-Scheffe theorem (see, for example, Graybill [6], Theorem 2.7.7) implies that ␪ˆ iBC is the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of ␪i when inference is restricted to using pilot bits from the ith time slot. The UMVUE property of ␪ˆ iBC was noted in
Rukhin [13] in a different application context. Figure 2 shows the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of ␪ˆ iPI and ␪ˆ iBC for ␪i in the range Ϫ2
dB to 10 dB [SINR is generally expressed in decibels (dB), deﬁned as 10 log10(␪i)] labeled as PI (A) and BC (A), respectively, for the case n ϭ 8. The range Ϫ2 dB to 10 dB is a practical

The

improvement

offered

by

␪ˆ

to

␪ˆ

is

quite

evident.

Also

shown

in

Figure

are

the RMSE values for ␪ˆ iPI and ␪ˆ iBC obtained by simulating 50,000 values of each estimator. These

values are labeled as PI (S) and BC (S), respectively. Although the simulated RMSE values in

Figure 2 are not necessary, since the formulas in (2) and (3) are exact, the good match between

the simulated and exact RMSE values suggests that 50,000 will be a sufﬁcient sample size to

validate the approximate RMSE formulas in what follows.

3. ESTIMATORS USING USER BITS

3.1. Absolute Value Estimators

Typically there are far fewer pilot bits than there are user bits. As we have previously

mentioned, the difﬁculty with using user bits is that the expected value of Uij is zero instead of

␮i. Hence, it is not possible to estimate ␪i using the Uij values directly. An ad-hoc approach for

using

user

bits,

ﬁrst

proposed

by

Gilchriest

[5],

is

to

estimate

␪i

by

computing

either

␪ˆ

PI i

or

␪ˆ iBC

using Zij ϭ ͉Uij͉ in place of Pij.

The ad hoc approach for using the user bits can be heuristically motivated as follows. Suppose

␪i is large, implying ␮i is large relative to ␴i. Given that aij ϭ Ϫ1, Uij Ͻ 0 with a high

probability. It follows that Zij Ϸ ϪUij. Since the distribution of Uij, given aij ϭ Ϫ1, is Gaussian with mean Ϫ␮i and variance ␴i2, it follows that the conditional distribution of Zij, given aij ϭ Ϫ1, is approximately Gaussian with mean ␮i and variance ␴i2. Similarly, given that

aij ϭ 1, Uij Ͼ 0 with a high probability and thus Zij Ϸ Uij. Since the distribution of Uij, given aij ϭ 1, is Gaussian with mean ␮i and variance ␴i2, the conditional distribution of Zij, given aij ϭ 1, is approximately Gaussian with mean ␮i and variance ␴i2. Since the conditional

distributions of Zij, given aij ϭ 1 and given aij ϭ Ϫ1, are the same and there are no other

possible values for aij, it follows the unconditional distribution for Zij is approximately Gaussian with mean ␮i and variance ␴i2. The ad hoc approach for estimating ␪i relies on the fact

that the Zij values are roughly stochastically equivalent to Pij values. Clearly, for small or even

intermediate values of ␪i the Zij values will have a substantially different distribution than Pij

values, and the ad-hoc approach estimators will not have good MSE properties.

bution with mean ͌m␪Z,i and variance 1, where ␪Z,i ϭ ␮Z2,i/␴Z2,i. It follows that ViZ ϭ

mZ៮ i2/␴Z2,i has an approximate noncentral chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom and

follow

that

mZ៮ i2/Ti2

has an approximate noncentral F distribution with numerator and denominator degrees of

freedom equal to 1 and ␩i, respectively, and noncentrality parameter equal to ␭iZ. In general, the asymmetry of the distribution of Zij prevents Z៮ i and Ti2 from being uncorrelated (see, for

example, Randles and Wolfe [12], p. 24, Corollary 1.3.33), and therefore they will not be

independent. We do note that for large ␪i, Z៮ i, and Ti2 will be approximately independent since the distribution of Zij is then approximately Gaussian. We absorb the error in assuming Z៮ i and Ti2 are independent as part of the approximate noncentral F distribution we use for mZ៮ i2/Ti2. It

the curves in Figure 3 over the interval Ϫ2 dB to 6 dB is explained by the fact that initially the

decreasing squared bias component of MSE offsets the increasing variance component, but

eventually the bias becomes near zero and the MSE becomes essentially equal to the variance.

3.2. Feedback Estimators
In this approach, we take advantage of the fact that the receivers (in typical operation) make correct predictions of the aij values with a high probability. Let aˆ ij denote the receiver’s

predicted value of aij. Using a likelihood ratio test, the value of aˆ ij is ϩ1 and Ϫ1 when Uij is greater and less than zero, respectively. Deﬁne Dij ϭ aˆ ijUij ϭ a*ij␮i ϩ ⑀*ij, where a*ij ϭ aˆ ijaij and ⑀*ij ϭ aˆ ij⑀ij. Since both aˆ ij and aij are {Ϫ1, ϩ1} random variables, a*ij is also a {Ϫ1, ϩ1} random variable and is equal to ϩ1 if and only if aˆ ij ϭ aij. It is straightforward to show that Pr(a*ij ϭ 1) ϵ p(␪i) ϭ ⌽(͌␪i).
We now derive the conditional distribution of ⑀*ij, given a*ij. First note that Dij is nonnegative. Thus, conditional on a*ij we must have ⑀*ij Ͼ Ϫa*ij␮i. Consider ﬁrst the case where a*ij ϭ 1.

Since a*ij is a {Ϫ1, ϩ1} random variable, it is easy to verify that ␭1i and ␭2i can equivalently be expressed as ␭1i ϭ ␪i(2Ni Ϫ m)2/(2m) and ␭2i ϭ 2␪iNi(m Ϫ Ni)/m, where Ni is the number of {a*ij}jmϭ1 values that are equal to ϩ1.

An approximate bias correction for ␪ˆ iPIϪF can be motivated from the special case where p(␪i)

Also shown in Figure 4 is the previously discussed analytic approximation for the RMSE of

both

␪ˆ

and

␪ˆ

have

smaller

than

␪ˆ iBCϪZ,

of

the

fact

that

exists

in

␪ˆ

when

For

greater

the

absolute value estimator is (slightly) better than both of the feedback estimators, reﬂecting the

that

following lemma shows how to linearly combine two estimators, based on pilot bits and user bits respectively, to yield a new estimator that has smaller MSE.
LEMMA 1: Suppose T1 and T2 are independent estimators of a parameter ␦ with biases B1 and B2, respectively, and variances ␴12 and ␴22, respectively. Consider the class C of estimators of ␦ which have the form T(␣1, ␣2) ϭ ␣1T1 ϩ ␣2T2, where the weights ␣1 and ␣2 are arbitrary real numbers. The weights of the estimator in C that has the smallest MSE are

It

follows

that

Ѩ{MSE(T)}/Ѩ␣i ϭ 2␣i␴i2 ϩ 2[␣1(␦ ϩ B1) ϩ ␣2(␦ ϩ B2) Ϫ ␦](␦ ϩ Bi), for i ϭ 1, 2.

Setting the two partial derivative equations equal to zero and solving for ␣1 and ␣2 gives the

optimal weights and substituting them into the expression for MSE(T) gives the minimum MSE

value.

The class of estimators deﬁned in Lemma 1 allow arbitrary weights on T1 and T2. If instead we impose the constraint that ␣1 ϩ ␣2 ϭ 1, the estimator T(␣1, ␣2) ϭ ␣1T1 ϩ (1 Ϫ ␣1)T2

730

Naval Research Logistics, Vol. 51 (2004)

becomes a weighted average of T1 and T2. If both T1 and T2 are unbiased then T(␣1, ␣2) will also be unbiased.

LEMMA 2: Suppose T1 and T2 are independent estimators of a parameter ␦ with biases B1 and B2, respectively, and variances ␴12 and ␴22, respectively. Consider the class C* of estimators of ␦ which has the form T(␣) ϭ ␣T1 ϩ (1 Ϫ ␣)T2, where 0 Յ ␣ Յ 1. The weight ␣ of the
estimator in C* that has the smallest MSE is

where

is

The proof of Lemma 2 is similar to the proof of Lemma 1 and is thus omitted.

Note that the optimal weight in Corollary 1 can equivalently be expressed as ␣opt ϭ ␴1Ϫ2/(␴1Ϫ2

and

both

estimators

are

is

a

well-known result (see, for example, Christensen [2], Theorem 2.7.1).

We

now

apply

Corollary

1

using

␪ˆ

and

␪ˆ iBCϪZ

as

T1

and

T2,

respectively.

with MSE(␪ˆ iBC) and MSE(␪ˆ iBCϪZ) given by (2) and (4), respectively. It follows from Corollary 1 that

Since both ␪ˆ iC1 and ␪ˆ iC2 depend on ␪i through the optimal weights, neither is directly useable. A practical approach is to estimate the optimal weights using an unbiased estimator such as ␪ˆ iBC, for example. We thus deﬁne

Analytic

for

and

are

largely

intractable,

but

not

particularly necessary since we will not be deﬁning other estimators that depend on these

expressions.

Figure 5 shows the optimal constrained (solid curves) and unconstrained weights (dashed

curves),

as

a

function

of

SINR,

for

the

combined

estimators

obtained

from

␪ˆ iBC

and

␪ˆ

BC i

ϪZ

for

the case of n ϭ 8 and m ϭ 20. In the case of constrained weights, Figure 5 shows that for small

SINR

(where

the

bias

in

␪ˆ

BCϪZ i

is

signiﬁcant)

most

of

the

weight

is

given

to

␪ˆ iBC.

On

the

other

hand,

for

intermediate

to

large

values

of

SINR,

where

the

bias

in

␪ˆ

BCϪZ i

has

become

small,

most

of

the

weight

is

given

to

␪ˆ

BCϪZ i

since

it

is

based

on

a

larger

sample

size.

In

the

case

of

unconstrained weights, there is no crossover point. For small SINR values, both unconstrained

weights are small which makes the combined estimator relatively small. As the SINR increases, the weight on ␪ˆ iBCϪZ increases more rapidly than the weight on ␪ˆ iBC.

the analytic RMSE approximations labeled as C1 (A) and C2 (A), respectively. The approximate

the

␪ˆ

of

which

are

labeled as EC1 (S) and EC2 (S), respectively. It is evident from Figure 7 that the cost of

estimating the unconstrained weights is appreciably more than the cost of estimating the

constrained

weights.

In

fact,

although

the

Once

again,

comparing

5. SMOOTHED VARIANCE ESTIMATORS

5.1. Pilot-Based Estimator

The AWGN model for the demodulator output discussed in Section 1 shows that the variance

of

the

noise

factor,

␴i2,

varies

from

time

slot

to

time

slot.

It

has

been

recognized

that

␴

2 i

is

a

slowly varying function of i (see Viterbi [19]). The average noise plus interference component,

for example, would only change with the addition/departure of a call in a CDMA system, or

when a discernible “rearrangement” of users has taken place due to mobility. The slowly varying

nature of ␴i2 suggests using exponential weighting of the within time slot estimates of the noise

variance.

In

particular,

we

could

consider

an

estimator

of

␴

2 i

of

the

form

Higuchi

estimates

calculated

using

both pilot and user bits. Analogous to ␪ˆ iPI, we could consider an estimator of ␪i of the form ␪ˆ iSV

ϭ

P៮ i2/␴ˆ i2,

which,

of

course,

reduces

to

␪ˆ

PI i

when

r

ϭ

1.

Furthermore,

we

could

consider

scaled

versions of ␪ˆ iSV to reduce bias.

The MSE properties of ␪ˆ iSV depend on the nature of the {␴k2} sequence. An interesting class

of models for the {␴k2} sequence would be an appropriate family of stationary stochastic

processes (e.g., ARMA models). The random nature of {␴k2} implies the {␪k} sequence is also

random. The inference problem shifts from estimating the parameter ␪i to predicting the realized

value

of

the

random

variable

␪i.

The

MSE

of

␪ˆ iSV

would

then

be

evaluated

as

E

where the expectation is with respect to the joint distribution of ␪ˆ iSV and ␪i. We defer the

distributed chi-square random variables with n Ϫ 1 degrees of freedom, it follows that the mean

and variance of W are ␮W ϭ n Ϫ 1 and ␴W2 ϭ 2(n Ϫ 1)r/(2 Ϫ r), respectively, where for

We shall approximate the distribution of W using a Satterthwaite approximation and write

W ϳ h␹␯2, where h ϭ ␴W2 /(2␮W) and ␯ ϭ 2␮W2 /␴W2 . Making the appropriate substitutions, we ﬁnd ␯ ϭ (n Ϫ 1)(2 Ϫ r)/r and h ϭ r/(2 Ϫ r). Next let Vi ϭ nP៮ i2/␴2. It follows that Vi has

a noncentral chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom and noncentrality parameter ␭i. It is well known that P៮ i (and hence Vi) is independently distributed of Si2, and it is clearly independent of S12, . . . , Si2Ϫ1. Thus, Vi and W are distributed independently and consequently

The approximate MSE formula for ␪ˆ iSVϪZ is similar to the MSE formula for ␪ˆ iSV, the two

differences being that m is used in place of n and ␪Z,i is used in place of ␪i. The squared bias

6. SUMMARY
Several important control actions in wireless communication systems (e.g., transmit power level determination, handoff decisions, data rate adaptation algorithms) depend on an accurate SINR estimator. In this paper, we have developed SINR estimators using some new approaches that yield estimators with signiﬁcantly smaller RMSE than traditional estimators. Estimators based on pilot bits only or user bits only were considered ﬁrst and then estimators that are linear combinations of these two types of estimators were discussed. It was discussed that for estimating the interference variance (the denominator of the SINR), long-term averaging via exponential smoothing is viable and dramatically reduces the RMSE of SINR estimators.
Approximate analytic expressions for the RMSE of the estimators were derived and their accuracy was validated using simulation methods. The analytic expressions serve two purposes. First, improved estimators based on bias correction and/or variance reduction become apparent

from the expressions and, second, optimal weights for combining pilot bit and user bit based estimators can be evaluated. Table 1 provides a summary and review of all the different estimators considered in this paper. A brief comment about the RMSE performance of each estimator is also provided. In general, our results show that the best estimators are obtained through optimal combining. Using estimated weights in place of the unknown optimal weights predictably increases the RMSE, but not to the extent of diminishing the value of combining.

where p ϭ Pr(aij ϭ 1). Let R be a random variable with a Gaussian distribution having mean ␮i and variance ␴i2. It follows from (16) that

It is easy to verify that the ratios ␮Z,i/␴Z,i, ␮i/␴Z,i, and ␴i/␴Z,i all depend on ␮i and ␴i through the ratio ␪i. Thus, the

ratio

is

a

It

therefore

from

(13)

that

and,

consequently,

gi and ␩i are as well.

APPENDIX B: SIMULATION DETAILS
Simulations were run to obtain RMSE estimates that could be compared to the analytic RMSE approximations. An overview of the simulation details is provided in this appendix. For each ␪i in the set {Ϫ2, Ϫ1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, each estimator was computed for 50,000 datasets of demodulator outputs and the simulation estimate of the RMSE was obtained from sample RMSE. The sample size of 50,000 was deemed sufﬁcient based on observed accuracy of the simulation results in cases where exact analytic RMSE formulas are available (e.g., ␪ˆ PI and ␪ˆ BC).
For the estimators based on pilot bits (Section 2), each dataset of demodulator outputs consisted of n ϭ 8 Pij observations that were simulated from a Gaussian distribution with mean ͌␪i and variance 1. In the case of the smoothed pilot bit-based estimators (Section 5.1), a warm-up period of 2000 datasets was used to allow the initial value associated with the exponential smoothing of the variance term to dissipate.
For the absolute value estimators based on user bits (Section 3.1), each dataset of demodulator outputs consisted of m ϭ 20 Uij observations that were simulated from a symmetric mixture of two Gaussian distributions that have respective means Ϯ͌␪i and variance 1. Again, a warm-up period of 2000 datasets was used when computing the smoothed user bit-based absolute value estimator (Section 5.2).
The datasets used for the feedback estimator (Section 3.2) were the same as those used for the absolute value estimator, but in this case the Uij observations were used to obtain user bit predictions (aˆ ij) rather than the Zij observations. The user bit predictions were then used to obtain the Dij observations from which the feedback estimator was computed.
For the combined estimators in Section 4, each dataset consist of both n ϭ 8 Pij observations (used to compute the estimator based on pilot bits) and m ϭ 20 Uij observations (used to compute the estimator based on user bits). For the combined smoothed estimators in Section 5.3, each dataset similarly consisted of both Pij observations and Uij observations, but in addition 2000 preliminary datasets were used as a warm-up period.
