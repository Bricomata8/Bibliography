Abstract—This paper theoretically analyzes the throughput of the dynamic multi-hop networks under high trafﬁc load condition. In order to reduce the number of hops and improve the throughput performance, the shortcut path between the non-neighboring nodes is established. However, the preceding packet hinders the establishment of the shortcut path when the trafﬁc load is high. To eliminate the interference from the preceding packet, we introduce intra-ﬂow interference canceller (IFIC). We derive the theoretical packet delivery rate (PDR) expression by taking into account the existence of preceding packets. Theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation elucidate the effectiveness of IFIC to improve the throughput performance in dynamic multi-hop networks even under high trafﬁc load condition.

I. INTRODUCTION
Multiple relay nodes forward the packet from a source node to a destination node in wireless multi-hop networks. They can extend communication range of ad hoc networks without any communication infrastructures [1], [2]. The applications of ad hoc networks include video monitoring of natural environments to predict disasters and public space monitoring for safety. These applications exhibit higher trafﬁc load and require higher packet delivery rate (PDR) than normal sensor applications. In order to achieve high PDR, opportunistic routing [3] and dynamic multi-hop techniques [4], [5] have been proposed. These schemes try to improve the PDR by choosing a better path for packet forwarding other than using a ﬁxed forwarding path. In dynamic multi-hop shortcut (DMHS) [4], if a node overhears the packet transmission from a node other than its immediate preceding node, a shortcut path is established. The use of the shortcut path reduces the number of required hops compared to the network with ﬁxed packet forwarding1. Since the relay node forwards the packet via either the path originally set up or the shortcut path, we obtain the path diversity gain. DMHS has been shown to be effective when the trafﬁc load is low.
In the high trafﬁc load applications, the packet generation interval at the source node becomes shorter. It means that the number of the relay nodes which try to forward the packet to the next relay node becomes larger. If the relay nodes

are in the relationship of hidden terminal (HT) from each other, packet collision may happen. We call this collision intra-ﬂow interference (IFI). The preceding packet hinders the establishment of the shortcut path. However, the preceding packet that causes IFI is not unknown at the node as the node has previously transmitted it. Focusing on this fact, an IFI canceller (IFIC) has been proposed in [7]. In IFIC, two packet frame formats are prepared and different formats are assigned to the nodes in the relation of HT. Each packet frame format has blank period during which the other packet frame format transmits the training sequence. This enables the node to estimate the channel coefﬁcient of the IFI. Thus, the node is able to remove IFI. It has been shown that IFIC achieves high PDR even if packet generation interval is short [7].
To the best of authors’ knowledge, the impact of IFIC in the high trafﬁc load condition where the packet forwarding path is dynamically changed has not yet been analyzed. Since the original IFIC does not take into account the establishment of the shortcut path, we need to slightly modify its operation. We ﬁrstly derive the theoretical expression of PDR by taking into account the existence of the preceding packet in the network. Then, based on the derived PDR expression, we obtain the throughput performance. Numerical simulation will conﬁrm its validity. Both theoretical analysis and computer simulation show the throughput improvement brought by the combination of DMHS and IFIC even under high trafﬁc condition. Throughput performance improves about 14% when the number of hops is 8.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system model considered in this paper is introduced and the concept of IFIC and DMHS are introduced. We provide PDR analysis in Section III. Section IV provides the numerical evaluation of the proposed DMHS+IFIC and its PDR perforamnce. Section V concludes the paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a half-duplex single frequency multi-hop network with N nodes, which is indexed by i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N }. A source node 0 constantly generates a packet v ∈ {0, 1, · · · }, with a ﬁxed packet generation interval Tint (sec). Let Tcom denote the time slot length required for one-hop transmission. The normalized trafﬁc load is deﬁned as G ≜ Tcom/Tint ∈ {1/2, 1/3, 1/4, · · · }. By convention, high trafﬁc condition

means G ≥ 1/3. Packet v is generated at time slot tv = t0 + (v/G) where t0 denotes the time slot at which packet 0 is generated. The routing path is set up as (0, 1, · · · , N ) so that the packet is forwarded from node i − 1 to node i, and then to node i + 1.
A. Intra-Flow Interference Canceller (IFIC)
Suppose that node i and node i+2 cannot carrier sense each other and they have packet v and packet v−1 to be transmitted, respectively. If both nodes transmit packets in the same time slot, the packet collision happens at intermediate node i+1. In this way, IFI is caused by a preceding packet, i.e., packet v−1. In order to enable IFI cancellation, two packet frame formats (PF1 and PF2) are prepared. Both formats have blank period at different location within a packet during which a training sequence of the other format is transmitted [7]. Suppose that nodes i and i+1 are assigned PF1, whereas nodes i+2 and i+3 are assigned PF2. Every two nodes that are in the relationship of HT, e.g., nodes i and i + 2, use different packet frame formats. Thus, even if packet collision happens at node i + 1, the training sequences of packet v − 1 can be received without interference. Then, the interference is cancelled because packet v − 1 is known interference by node i + 1 [7].
B. Introduction of IFIC into DMHS
When a packet is transmitted from node j, j < i − 1, node i may overhear it and correctly decode it. We call such a temporary path a shortcut path. However, with the conventional packet forwarding protocol, node i discards the received packet because its media access control (MAC) header does not contain the address of node i. In order to overcome this problem, DMHS employs multiple addressing which allows MAC header and routing tables to contain not only the MAC address of the next hop node but also those of several hopahead nodes so that the overheard packets via shortcut path is not discarded. If node i successfully overhear packet v from node j via the shortcut path, it is preferable to stop forwarding packet v from node k, j < k < i. Thus, node i broadcasts a stop transmitting packet (STP) to notify node k, j < k < i, of the packet reception at node i.
When the trafﬁc load increases, i.e., G ≥ 1/3, a packet collision may happen frequently due to the shorter packet generation interval Tint. In such a case, the opportunity for shortcut path establishment might decrease due to the transmission of preceding packet as shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, node i + 2 transmits packet v − 1 in the same time slot as node i − 1 transmits packet v. In such a case, even if the channel quality between node i − 1 and node i + 1 is good, the shortcut path cannot be created due to the packet collision. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce IFIC in order for DMHS to work in high trafﬁc load. However, the original IFIC does not consider the shortcut path. Following the assignment procedure of packet frame format [7], nodes i − 1 and i + 2 are assigned the same packet frame format, i.e., PF2. Therefore, the IFI cannot be canceled at node i + 1. In order to let the IFIC to work under the dynamically changing packet forwarding paths, an

additional packet frame format (PF3) is introduced in this paper. Neighboring two nodes are grouped and then assigned to one of the three packet frame formats so that neighboring node groups are assigned different packet frame formats.

III. PDR ANALYSIS

In this section, we derive the theoretical expression of PDR

for the dynamic multi-hop network. Without loss of generality,

the original route is denoted as (0, 1, · · · , i, · · · , N ). The inter-

ference is assumed to be perfectly cancelled if it is transmitted

in a different packet format from the desired packet. Let p(i,j)

denote the to node j,

pwrhoibcahbiilsitydeoﬁfnseudccaessspf(uil,j)tra=ns1m−iss∫io0∞n

from node i Pγ Pe (γ )dγ ,

where Pγ is the probability of the exponentially distributed

channel gain, i.e., γ ∼ exp(1) and Pe(γ) is the packet error

rate. We assume that Pe(γ) = 0 if γ is larger than the

sensitivity level Γ and Pe(γ) = 1 otherwise. For notational

simplicity we assume p(i,i+1) = po and p(i,i+2) = ps. However, the following analysis can be easily extended to the

case that the channel qualities are different.

A. Low Trafﬁc Load Condition

In the low trafﬁc load condition, the transmission of packet
v is not affected by packet v − 1. The PDR expressions for N = 1 and N = 2 are given by P1L = po and P2L = ps + (1 − ps)p2o, respectively. Let us next consider N = 3. If the shortcut path is created from node 0 to node 2, the remaining
hop is one hop from node 2 to node 3. If the shortcut path
is not created, the remaining hops are two hops from node 1
to node 3. Thus, the PDR expression for N = 3 is given by P3L = psP1L + (1 − ps)poP2L. Similarly, the PDR expression for any N > 3 can be recursively obtained as

PNL = psPNL −2 + (1 − ps)poPNL −1.

(1)

B. High Trafﬁc Load Condition

We consider the scenario with G = 1/2 but this analysis
can be easily extended to G < 1/2. Without loss of generality,
we set t0 = 0. Since G = 1/2, a new packet is generated at the source node at every two time slots. Let lvt denote the location of packet v at time slot t. Let QN [lvt = i] denote the probability that packet v is located at node i in time slot t. Let QN [lvt+1 = j | lvt = i] denote the probability that packet v is transferred from node i to node j after time slot t. Furthermore, let QN [lvt −1 = j | lvt = i] denote the probability that packet v − 1 is located at node j when packet v is located at node i

at time slot t. As long as it is clear from the context, we use
Q[.] instead of QN [.]. 1) N = 1 and 2: Since no packet collision happens for
N < 3, the PDR expressions are the same as those of the low trafﬁc environment. Thus, we have P1H = P1L and P2H = P2L.
2) N = 3: If packet v − 1 is located at node 2 when
packet v is generated at node 0, packet v can not reach node 2
due to the half-duplex constraint even if the channel condition
between node 0 and 2 is good. Thus, it is necessary to obtain the probability Pr[lvt2−v1 = 2 | |lvt2v = 0]. Since the location of packet v − 1 is not affected by packet v, we have Pr[lvt2−v1 = 2 | |lvt2v = 0] = Pr[lvt2−v1 = 2].
We derive the PDR expression by induction. Packet 0 is
located at node 2 at time slot t2 if and only if it has not been transmitted via the shortcut path in time slot t0 and t1. Thus, we have Pr[l0t2 = 2] = (1 − ps)2p2o.
Similarly, the probability that packet 1 is located at node 2
when packet 2 is generated is obtained as

Q[l1t4 = 2] = Q[l0t2 = 2] × p2o(1 − ps)

+ (1 − Q[l0t2 = 2]) × (1 − ps)2p2o.

(2)

The probability for other packets can be obtained in the recursive manner and it converges to

Q[lvt2−v1

=

2]

=

p2o(1 − ps)2 − p2ops(1 − ps)

.

(3)

Due to the half-duplex constraint, node 2 cannot receive packet q from node 0 if packet q−1 is located at node 2, i.e., lvt2−v1 = 2. Thus, the PDR expression for N = 3 becomes

P3H = Q[lvt2−v1 = 2] × poP2H + (1 − Q3[lqt2−v1 = 2]) × P3L.(4)

3) N = 4: The PDR expression for N = 4 can be obtained

in the similar manner as for N = 3. However, the impact of

packet v − 1 on the transmission of packet v becomes more signiﬁcant. We have Q[l0t2 = 2] = (1 − ps)2p2o, which is the same as that for N = 3. To calculate the probability that

packet 1 is located at node 2 when packet 2 is generated, we

need to take into account both l0t2 and l0t3 . Q[l1t4 = 2] can be

obtained as

Q[l1t4

Q[l0t2 = 2] × po × {Q[l0t3 +(1 − Q[l0t3 = 3|l0t2 =

+(1 − Q[l0t2 = 2]) × (1 − ps)2p2o

(5)

with Q[l0t3 = 3|l0t2 = 2] = (1 − ps)po, which is the probability that packet 0 is successfully transmitted from node 2 to node

3 when it is located at node 2 in time slot t2. For large v, since Q[lvt2−v1 = 2] = Q[lvt2−v− 2 2 = 2], we have

Finally, the PDR expression for N = 4 can be obtained as

4) N ≥ 5: For N = 5, it is necessary to consider the
case that packet v − 1 is located at either node 2 or node 3
at time slot t2v. Thus, in the following, we ﬁrst derive the probabilities Q[lvt2−v1 = 2] and Q[lvt2−v1 = 3]. Again we have Q[l0t2 = 2] = (1 − ps)2p2o. The probability that packet 1 is located at node 2 at time slot t4 is given by (5). The probability that packet v − 1 is located at node 2 at time t2v is given as

Q[lvt2−v1 = 2] = Q[lvt2−v− 2 2 = 2] × +(1 − Q[lvt2−v− 2 1 =

Since Q[lqt2−q1 = 2] = Q[lqt2−q− 2 2 = 2] after convergence, we have

Q[lqt2−q1

=

(9)

Next, we derive the probability that packet v − 1 is located at node 3 at time t2v. The probability that packet 0 is located at node 3 at time t2 is equivalent to the probability that packet 0 arrives at node 3 via the original path and the shortcut path, thus we have Q[l0t2 = 3] = 2(1 − ps)pops.
Similarly, the probability that packet 1 is located at node 3 at time t4 is given as

Q[l1t4 = 3] = Q[l0t2 = 2] × pops + (1 − Q[l0t2 = 2]) × 2(1 − ps)pops. (10)

Since Q[lvt2−v1 = 2] = Q[lvt2−v− 2 2 = 2], we have

Q[lvt2−v1 = 3] = Q[lvt2−v1 = 2] × pops + (1 − Q[lvt2−v1 = 2]) × 2(1 − ps)pops. (11)

To derive the PDR expression for N = 5, we need to consider the following three cases,
1) packet v − 1 is located at node 2 at time t2v, 2) packet v − 1 is located at node 3 at time t2v, and 3) packet v − 1 is located at some node other than 2 and
3.
In the case of i), packet v needs to be transferred from node 0 to node 1. If packet v − 1 is transferred from node 2 to node 3 at time slot t2v, packet v needs to be transferred from node 1 to 2 in time slot t2v+1. In the case of ii), packet v can be transferred from node 0 to node 2. However, if packet v − 1 is transferred from node 3 to node 4 at time slot t2v, packet v should be transferred from node 2 to node 3 in time slot t2v+1. In the case of iii), the transmission of packet v is not affected by packet v − 1, thus it can be considered as the transmission under low trafﬁc condition. Finally, we have the PDR expression for N ≥ 5, which is shown at the top of the next page and

For N > 6, the number of the scenarios we need to take into account increases, we use the same expression as for N = 5. Although the expression is approximate for N > 6, we validate its accuracy via computer simulation in Sect. IV.

Tciom, i ∈ {CSMA/CA, DMHS, IFIC, DMHS/IFIC}, is the

average required time for one-hop transmission of each scheme

which will be derived in the following. The explanation of each

variable is given in Table I.

1) CSMA/CA: For the ﬁxed routing scheme, we have

TcCoSmMA/CA

TDATA + TACK +

WCNT ×Tslot 2

+ TDIFS

+ TSIFS.

2) DMHS: When a shortcut path is created, STP trans-

mission time is necessary in addition to the average path

packet delivery time of ﬁxed routing scheme. STP transmission

time can be the same length of ACK packet. However, since

shortcut does not always occur, the average one-hop packet

transmission time for DMHS is approximated to that of the ﬁxed packet forwarding, i.e., TcDoM mHS = TcCoSmMA/CA.

3) IFIC: Since multiple nodes can concurrently transmit

packets, MAC protocol other than CSMA/CA can be adopted.

In this paper, we adopt the MAC protocol in [7]. The average

transmission time for one-hop transmission of IFIC is obtained

as TcIoFmIC = TTS + TPL + TA′ CK + TBLANK + TSIFS.

4) DMHS + IFIC: Since one more packet frame format is

introduced, the additional blank time is required, thus we have TcDoM mHS/IFIC = TcIoFmIC + TBLANK + TSTP + TSIFS.

B. Performance Evaluation
The radio parameters follow IEEE 802.11g and ITU-R P.1411-7 UHF Model-median [8] is adopted for propagation model. We set G = 1/2. The average required time for onehop transmission of each scheme with the parameters in Table I is given in Table II. The node layout is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 shows the PDR of four schemes. The proposed DMHS-IFIC and IFIC w/ ﬁxed routing were evaluated by both theoretical calculations developed in Sec. III and computer simulations, whereas DMHS and the ﬁxed routing were evaluated only by computer simulations. Theoretical calculation results are shown by solid lines and simulated results are shown by plots. The ﬁgure shows that PDR of CSMA/CA signiﬁcantly degrades due to IFI [7]. Comparing with the ﬁxed path forwarding scheme, DMHS signiﬁcantly improves the PDR performance for small N . This is because shortcut paths reduce the hop count and hence the opportunity that IFI occurs is reduced. However, PDR drops rapidly when N is larger than four. Since IFI can be effectively suppressed by IFIC, higher PDR is obtained by IFIC with ﬁxed path forwarding compared to ﬁxed path forwarding and DMHS. However, since no shortcut path is created, the required hop count is always N . The propposed DMHS-IFIC can achieve the PDR performance more than 90% irrespective of the number of hops N . Furthermore, Fig. 3 shows the theoretical value obtained from the analytical expression derivation in Sect. III quite well

agrees with that obtained by computer simulation up to N = 8, which is sufﬁcient for general multihop applications.
The throughput performance of each scheme is shown in Fig. 4, where lines show the numerical results and the plots show the theoretical results obtained in Sec. III. Fig. 4 clearly shows the theoretical results and the numerical results well agree with each other even for large N , i.e., N > 5. This conﬁrms the validity of the theoretical expression. Fig. 4 shows that as the number of hops N increases, the throughput performances of CSMA/CA and DMHS w/ CSMA/CA signiﬁcantly degrade due to the IFI. By introducing DMHS and IFIC into the system, the throughput signiﬁcantly increases. This is due to the path diversity obtained by DMHS and the effective cancellation of IFI. Although TcDoM mHS/IFIC > TcIoFmIC, the throughput performance of DMHS/IFIC is higher than that of IFIC only, e.g., about 14% improvement when N = 8. This result indicates that the combination of DMHS and IFIC is quite effective to increase the throughput performance when the number of hops is large.

analysis have conﬁrmed the throughput improvement brought
by the introduction of DMHS and IFIC into the system. It has
been shown that the throughput performance improves about 14% when the number of hops is 8.
Interesting future works include the analysis of the estab-
lishment of the shortcut path and the optimization of the
number of packet frame formats in the general node layout.
