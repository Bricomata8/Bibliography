Abstract – Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a way to communicate directly between devices without going through the base station or other infrastructure. In many D2D communication systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is used in order to maintain the similarity with the mobile communication systems and to secure a sufficient transmission distance. In OFDMA systems, sub-channels, consisting of multiple subcarriers, are used to concurrently support multiple users. Although sub-channels in OFDMA systems are theoretically orthogonal, there is non-negligible interference from other sub-channels due to in-band emission. This paper considers a D2D group-casting system with a relay focusing on the effect of the interference from other subchannels, and calculates the outage probabilities according to the relay position.

I. INTRODUCTION
Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a method to exchange direct traffic between devices without going through the infrastructure such as a base station or an access point [13]. Compared to the traditional communication methods through the infrastructure, D2D communication technology has the advantage of increasing the resource efficiency, improving the system capacity, decreasing the delay and power consumption due to the proximity. In many D2D communication systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is used in order to maintain the similarity with mobile communication systems and to secure a sufficient communication distance. In OFDMA systems, subchannels, consisting of a group of subcarriers, are used to concurrently support multiple users. In theory, if time and frequency synchronization is perfect, different sub-channels in OFDMA systems are orthogonal and not interfered with each other. However, in real systems, even with perfect time and frequency synchronization, there can be non-negligible interference from other sub-channels due to in-band emission [4-8].
One of popular transmission configurations of D2D communication systems is group-casting with multiple receivers. In group-casting, especially when the transmitter is located near or at the edge of the group, a single transmission from the transmitter may not achieve the required success rate at the receivers. In this case, a relay can be used to reduce the outage probability for the receivers. The use of a relay in a D2D communication system has also some other advantages

[9-10]. For example, the transmission power of the D2D transmitter can be reduced due to the short transmission distance. Although there are many studies to consider relays in D2D group-casting systems, most of them do not consider the interference from other sub-channels.
This paper focuses on the interference from other subchannels with ignoring other effects such as fading or cochannel interference, and considers relay positions in a group to minimize the outage probability due to interference from other sub-channels. When a transmitter sends data to multiple receivers in a group, the error probabilities may not be small for some receivers, especially those far away from the transmitter or close to other sub-channel interferers. To overcome these problems, we consider a repetitive transmission through a relay in addition to the direct transmission between the transmitter and the receivers. In this paper, we calculate outage probabilities considering the interference from other sub-channels and find the position of a relay producing the lowest outage probability. This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we address the system model considered in this paper and calculate the outage probability. In Section III, we show the performance according to relay positions through simulation results and conclusions are presented in Section IV.
II. OPTIMAL RELAY POSITION FOR GROUP-CASTING
A. System Model
In this paper, we consider a D2D group-casting system with focusing on the interference from other sub-channels ignoring other effects such as fading, insufficient signal power, cochannel interference, and intra-group collisions. We assume that there is sufficient diversity and the power of received signal is sufficiently larger than noise. We also assume that the collisions in the same group and the interference between groups in the same channel can be carefully handled by smart resource management techniques. Hence, we only consider interference from other sub-channels for the cause of reception failures. Although the interference from other sub-channels is very weak and thus only receivers nearby interferers are affected, the interference from other sub-channels cannot be ignored, especially when the number of sub-channels is large. In order to reduce the outage probability due to the interference, a relay can be used. Fig. 1 shows the system model used in this paper. The transmitter (source) sends data to the receivers (destinations) in the group and the relay repeatedly transmits

B. Outage Probability

Suppose that there are M sub-channels in a circular cell with radius R , and there is one D2D group per sub-channel. If

we consider the transmission on the nth sub-channel, the other M 1 sub-channels produce other-channel interference. Let

the interference effect from the mth sub-channel to the nth sub-channel be m,n , where m,n  1 if m  n and

0  m,n  1 otherwise. We consider a source, a destination,

and a relay in the nth sub-channel and an interferer in the mth

sub-channel, as shown in Fig. 1. dSD represents the distance between the source and the destination, dSR represents the distance between the source and the relay, dRD is the distance between the relay and the destination, dOR,m represents the

distance between the mth -channel interferer and the relay, and

dOD,m is the distance between the mth -channel interferer and

the destination. PSTX is the transmitting power of the source,

POTX is the transmitting power of the interferer, and PRTX is the

transmitting power of the relay. The received signal power at

the destination can be expressed as K1PSTX d SD , where  is

the path-loss exponent parameter between two devices and K1

is a constant. The received interference power at the

Therefore, The signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the destination, denoted as SIRSD , can be defined as follows.

The outage probability can be reduced by repeated transmission through the relay. In this case, we need to consider two transmissions: from the source to the relay and from the relay to the destination. Let R be the required SIR
at the relay. Similar to Eq. (4), the outage probabilities of the transmission from the source to the relay and from the relay to the destination can be expressed as follows.

The reception process at the destination is successful if the direct transmission from the source is successful or the transmission through the relay is successful. Hence, the outage probability at the receiver can be written as follows.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS
In order to verify the equations, the outage performance is measured with simulation. In the simulation, there are 25 subchannels. In each sub-channel, there is one D2D group having

a circular area of radius 30m, and 30 receivers are uniformly distributed in each group. The central position of the considered group is (0,0). The source is located from -30m to 0m, and the relay is placed from -30m to 30m on the X axis. We also assume that the transmission powers of the source, relay, and interferers are all same. The detailed simulation parameters are shown in Table 1.

Fig. 2 shows the outage probability according to the relay position with various source positions in the group. The solid lines represent the simulation results and the dotted lines show the analytical results. While the analysis considers only the nearest interferer, receivers are affected by the interference from all interferers in the simulation. Hence, an outage probability produced from the simulation is always larger than the corresponding outage probability using the analysis. Fig. 3 shows the optimal relay positions according to the source positions. Note that that the optimal relay position is not the center of a group especially when the source is in the edge of the group since the link between the source and the relay needs to be also reliable.

IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have discussed D2D relays for OFDMAbased D2D group-casting systems considering the interference from other sub-channels. We obtained the outage probability according to the relay position through the analysis and simulation. The analytical and simulation results show that the optimal relay position can be determined according to the source position. In this paper, we focused on the interference from other sub-channels and could not consider other causes for the outage such as fading, co-channel interference and intra-group collisions. Further analysis and accurate simulations are required with assumptions that are more practical.
