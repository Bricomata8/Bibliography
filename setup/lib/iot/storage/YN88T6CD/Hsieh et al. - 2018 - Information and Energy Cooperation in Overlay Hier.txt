Abstract—In overlay hierarchical cognitive radio (HCR) networks, the primary system (PS) and the secondary system (SS) can cooperate to exploit the spectrum resource more efficiently. In this paper, we propose a new HCR, in which an energy harvesting (EH) device is additionally deployed at the primary receiver (PR) such that the PS can not only share the spectrum resources with the SS, but also harvest energy from the SS, achieving a new simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) paradigm. In the considered structure, the secondary base station (SB) can help relay the PS’s signal via an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol, and a power splitting EH device is adopted at the PR. A cooperative strategy is proposed for maximizing the efficiency of the information and power transfer. We optimize two precoders at the SB (for the PS and SS, respectively) and the power splitting factor for the PR. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, it is a real challenge. To facilitate the optimization process, a precoding structure is first proposed to reduce the number of parameters. The resultant optimization problem can then be equivalently solved using a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach. Numerical results show that the proposed strategy provides a promising improvement for information and energy cooperation, as compared with existing methods.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless power transfer (WPT) has been a promising technology to offer stable and sustainable power to low-power wireless systems [1]. Applying WPT in hierarchical cognitive radio (HCR) networks is invented to further improve the spectrum utilization and prolong the battery lifetime [1]-[10].
The WPT technologies used in HCR are mainly divided into two categories, the wireless powered communication networks (WPCN) and the simultaneously wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. In WPCN-based HCR networks, the energy harvesting device is usually allocated at the secondary transmitter (ST) to perform the harvest-thentransmit protocol [2]-[4], in which the communication equipment is powered by WPT. In [2], an energy harvesting (EH) device is placed at the ST to store energy in rechargeable batteries with the finite capacity. The cognitive sensing and access policies are studied to maximize the SS’s transmission rate. The authors in [3] and [4] proposed strategies that the ST can opportunistically harvest RF energy from nearby primary transmitters (PTs) to maximize the total throughout.

An alternative design is based on SWIPT, where the information signal is involved in the radiated RF waveform [5], [6]. The authors in [5] deploy power splitting EH devices at the ST so that the PT conducts the SWIPT and the ST jointly transmits the signals of the SS and the PS with the additional harvested energy. In [6], the authors extend the design in [5] to the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based scenario, where the additional degree of subcarriers is utilized in the joint information and energy cooperation schemes.
The above-mentioned design deploys the EH devices at the transmitter. It is noted that the harvested energy at the EH device is generally much smaller than the transmit power. For instance, the maximum harvested power at a freespace distance of 40 meters is just 7µW and 1µW for 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz [7]. Hence, the transmitters with energy harvested devices are suitable for the sensor networks that do not frequently transmit the information signals. The alternative design is to deploy the EH device at the receiver to offer the additional power for information decoding (ID), effectively prolonging the lifetime of the receiver [8]-[10]. In [8], the designed SR can receive the RF radiation to perform either the EH or the ID. The authors in [9] studied the SRs which can be divided into two categories, the ID and EH receivers. The ST uses an artificial noise (AN)-aided precoding method to maximize the secrecy rate under the limited interference in the PR. In [10], the time-switching EH device is placed at the PR and it can harvest the energy from the transmitted information signals in the SS. The time-switching factor and the beamforming technology are jointly optimized to improve the amount of the harvested power at the PR and the SS’s transmission rate. However, in some situations, the PB-PR channel link may be poor, which seriously degrades the uplink/downlink performance of the PS. It motivates us to develop a new information and energy cooperation strategy to overcome the dilemma.
In this paper, we study a new information and energy cooperation strategy for an EH-based HCR network [10]. In the proposed scenario, the ST and PT are the secondary base station (SB) and the primary base station (PB), respectively. The SB can not only act as a relay node to help the PS convey its signals but also transmit its own signals to the SR; meanwhile, the SB offers wireless energy to the PR, achieving a new win-win situation. Specifically, the SB uses an amplify-

and-forward (AF) protocol to help relay the PS’s signal. The signal transmission in the considered system is then performed in two phases. In the first phase, the PB sends its signal to both the SB and PR. In the second phase, the SB helps the PB relay the PS’s signal, and the SB simultaneously transmits its signal to the SR. In addition, the PR divides the received signal into EH and ID portion accordance with a power splitting factor. We use two precoders at the SB (one for the PS and the other for the SS) to improve the information and energy transfer efficiency. A zero-forcing (ZF) precoder is then adopted at the SB to prevent the interference resulted from the SS in the PR. Hence, the PR can use the maximum ratio combining (MRC) scheme to optimally combine the received two-phase signals. Consequently, the cooperation strategy is commenced to jointly optimize the two precoders and power splitting factor such that the SS’s transmission rate is maximized, and the information rate of the PS is guaranteed. Owing to the inclusion of relaying capability, the formulated optimization problem cannot be easily solved in its original form. To find a tractable solution, we then formulate the problem as semidefinite programming (SDP). The objective function, however, is not convex due to its fractional form. Hence, the Charnes-Cooper transformation is used to transfer the problem into a series of equivalent optimizations which are finally conducted with semidefinite relaxation (SDR) [11]. We further rigorously prove that the solution of the SDR approach is a rank-one solution which means the proposed SDR approach is equivalent to the original problem. Finally, some simulations are carried out to show the performance of the proposed cooperation strategy, and it indicates that the proposed information and energy cooperation outperforms the design in [10], especially when the channel quality of the PBSB-PR link is getting better.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the signal model of the proposed HCR and the corresponding information and energy cooperation strategy are presented. The optimization process is detailed in Section III. Simulation results are given in Section IV. Finally, we draw conclusions in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We study a novel information and energy cooperation strategy for EH-based HCR network proposed in [10]. In the considered design, the SB can further help the PS to convey its signals; meanwhile, the SB transmits its own signals to the SR. Hence, this structure is benefit when the PB-PR link is poor and PB-SB-PR is well, compared with the design in [10]. Specifically, the PS’s signals are transmitted into two phases. In the first phase, the PB transmits its signals to the PR and SB, respectively. In the second phase, the SB helps the PS conduct SWIPT, where the SB is treated not only as an AF relay node but also a WPT, as shown in Fig. 1. Herein, the SB and PR are equipped with NSB and NPR antennas, respectively, to enhance the transmission rate and harvested energy with beamforming technology. The associated received signals models are detailed as follows.

Assume the PB broadcast its signal xp with power qp to

both the PR and the SB. Without loss of generality, we assume

III. PROPOSED EH-BASED HCR NETWORKS

A. Problem Formulation

The energy and information strategy is conducted by jointly

designing power splitting factor ρ and the two precoders WP and wS for maximizing the achievable rate of the SS,
providing that the information rate and harvested energy as the

PR must exceed present threshold values of γPS and ΓPS , respectively. The optimization problem is thus formulated as

follows

Here, (16d) indicates that the SB does not interfere with the PR,
and (16e) represents the power constraint at the SB. Herein, Rs , Rp , and PEH are represented in (15), (14), and (8), respectively.

B. Optimum Solution

As shown in (16), the optimization problem is not jointly
convex in ( ρ, WP , wS ) . To make the problem tractable, a
series of equivalent optimization problems are cast to facilitate the finding of the optimum solution. First, define hɶ PB,SB =

(18)

where USB,PR ∈ ℂNPR×NPR , ΣSB,PR ∈ ℝNPR ×NSB and VSB,PR ∈ ℂNSB×NSB are the left-singular eigenvectors, singular matrix, and right-singular vectors corresponding to H SB,PR . The following precoding structure is proposed for WP to simplify the optimization problem.

Even though the objective function now becomes linear fractional form of the designed parameters, the transferred optimization problem can not be easily solved in its current form. Resorting to the Charnes-Cooper transformation [11], we can equivalently transfer the linear fractional programming into a linear programming problem. Accordingly, by setting uQS = DS and uλp = g p , the problem (20) can be transformed to an optimization problem shown as follows

Herein, λp is replaced by gp and the additional variable u is involved in the optimization. It is noted that (21) is not jointly
( ) convex in u, ρ, g p , DS , whereas it is a standard SDP
problem if ρ is foxed and rank relaxation is adopted for DS . Then, ρ can be solved numerically via one-dimensional
search [12]. Accordingly, the SDP can be solved by using
interior-point method. Generally, the SDR approach does not
guarantee the rank-one solution. However, it is shown that the
optimum solution for DS is indeed rank-one, and thereby, the obtained solution is also optimum for the problem (21). The
detailed derivation can be referred to Appendix.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

The performance of the proposed information and energy

cooperation strategy (marked as power splitting) is compared

with that derived in [10] (marked as time switching). In the

simulation, the channel links are assumed to be Rayleigh flat

fading, and NSB = 4 and NPR = 3. The power value of the

noise

are

all

normalized

to

unity,

i.e.,

The simulations are commenced by evaluating the

performance of the two information and energy cooperation

strategies with different values of the energy transfer

efficiency. For both schemes, the system parameters are set as

Fig. 2 shows the SS’s

information rate for various SB transmission power value. As

shown in this figure, the SS’s information rate increases with

an increasing value of QSB in both strategies. This result is reasonable since the QoS requirement of the PS is easily

satisfied, given a higher SB transmission power value, and

hence, more power resource can be allocated to the SS. For the

same reason, the SS’s information rate also increases as the

277

energy-transfer efficiency is increased for any fixed SB

transmission power value. The results also reveal that the

design in [10] outperforms the proposed strategy in low

transmission power region of QSB , whereas the reverse is true in high transmission power region. This result arises since (i)

the AF protocol is essentially non-beneficial in low

transmission power region, yielding poor SNR values in the

considered system; (ii) in [10], the PB can adaptively adjust

the time switching factor governing the periods for ID and EH,

respectively, whereas the time periods for which the relay

receives or transmits the signals are fixed in the considered

system. In contrasts, in high transmission power region, where

the SB has sufficient power to meet the QoS requirements, the

SB of the proposed design can use two different precoders

with different directions and power values, leading to a better

performance. The SB in [10], however, can only use a

beamforming to maintain the EH QoS at the PR and to

enhance the SS’S information rate.

Fig. 3 indicates the effect of the channel quality on the SS’s

information rate. Herein, qp = 20 dB, γ PS = 3 bps/Hz, ΓPS =

10

and (1,1,1,0.5). It is seen that channel qualities of (1,1,1,2) and

(1,1,1,0.5) yield the best and worst performance, respectively.

This is due to the fact two cases differ only in the variance of

the SB-PR link, and the SS’s information rate is improved

with an increasing SB-SR channel quality, and vice versa.

Also, we can observe that in the low-to-medium SB

transmission power region, the proposed strategy achieves the

best performance given the channel quality of (1,1,2,1). The

reason follows from the fact that a larger value of QSB can dramatically improve the SNR at the PR and facilitate the QoS

satisfaction in the low SNR region.

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, an information and energy cooperation strategy is proposed for an EH-based HCR network. The basic premise of the proposed strategy is that the SS provides energy to the PS, while the PS offers an opportunity to access the spectrum to the SS in return. Owing to the overlay protocol, the EH device operates in a power splitting mode, and the information and energy transfer are optimized through the joint design of the two precoders at the SB and the power splitting factor at the PR. The optimum precoder is determined by means of an SDR approach. The numerical results have shown that the proposed cooperation strategy can improve both the information rate and energy transfer efficiency, especially for a better PB-SB-PR link.

From the complementary slackness condition of (22), we have

Λ5DS = 0 .

If the optimum dual variables λ2 and λ3 , denoted as λ2* and λ3* , respectively, are λ2* = λ3* = 0, then µ1 = λ1 = 0 by (26) and (27). Therefore, λ2* and λ3* cannot be zero

simultaneously, and Φ is a full-rank matrix consequently.

Since A1 is a rank-one matrix, the rank of Λ5 is either NSB

or NSB - 1. If the rank of Λ5 is NSB , then DS = 0 which

violates the constraint g2 or does not reach to the optimum

value of the primal problem. Therefore, the rank of Λ5 must

be NSB - 1. Thus, DS have to lies in the null space of Λ5

whose dimension is one.
