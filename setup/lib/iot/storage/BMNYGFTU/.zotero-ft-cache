Abstract— Accurate tracking of the sinkholes that are appearing frequently now is an important method of protecting human and property damage. Although many sinkhole detection systems have been proposed, it is still far from completely solved especially indepth area. Furthermore, detection of sinkhole algorithms experienced the problem of unstable result that makes the system difﬁcult to ﬁre a warning in real-time. In this paper, we proposed a method of sinkhole tracking that takes advantage of the recent development of CNN transfer learning. Our system consists of three main parts which are binary segmentation, sinkhole classiﬁcation, and sinkhole tracking. The experiment results show that the sinkhole can be tracked in real-time on the dataset. These achievements have proven that the proposed system is able to apply to the practical application.

I. INTRODUCTION
A sinkhole is deﬁned as a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of the collapse of the surface layer. The human-induced sinkhole has been increasing rapidly with the high number of construction activity in urban areas. This kind of sinkhole is the main source of many disasters which need to be detected to protect loss of human life and infrastructure. Therefore, early warning of the sinkhole is an emergent problem for the government and social organization to improve the quality of human life where sinkhole occurs frequently, especially in the resident area.
Recently, thanks to the availability of large-scale training data and the advance of high-performance GPUs, various deep learning-based methods have been proposed to signiﬁcantly improve the state-of-the-art of category-speciﬁc object detection which is similar to the problem of sinkhole detection. Faster RCNN proposed by S. Ren [2] can achieve high accuracy. However the processing time is not fast enough to be implemented in real-time system. In order to obtain real-time performance, YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework [3] formulates the region proposal as a regression problem. A unique feature of YOLO is that it uniﬁes the separate components of object detection into single convolutional network that simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes (regions) and class probabilities for those boxes. The accuracy of YOLO framework is still affected by small object which

appear in the processed image. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to apply Faster RCNN and YOLO to the sinkhole detection problem. The ﬁrst requirement of sinkhole detection problem is real-time performance. In addition, the sinkhole images are captured at different distances, therefore, some sinkholes may appear in small shape.
Unlike other mentioned methods of detecting potential sinkholes, thermal imagery uses the fact that the surface temperature of inside sinkhole area is far different from that of the surrounding area. The paper [4] use a drone mounted with Far-Infrared (FIR) camera to monitor a large area. They observed the optimal time for recording the sinkhole videos by observing the temperature difference over time. From the recorded videos, candidate of sinkhole areas are segmented using adaptive binarization method. Then a convolutional neural network (CNN) [5] and a Boosted Random Forest (BRF) are stacked to classify potential sinkhole into real one. Although the method of detecting sinkhole by FIR camera can give early warning message about the appearing of sinkhole, the result is not stable due to the noise which may be contained in the output image from FIR camera. In addition, the position of sinkhole cannot be tracked to ﬁre correct alarm. In this paper, we introduce automatic sinkhole tracking system to support an early detection and warning of sinkhole using dataset of [4].
The dataset is collected by using FIR camera mounted on drone. Our system consists of three main parts. Firstly, candidate sinkhole areas are extracted from the binary image, then CNN transfer learning is applied to classify sinkhole candidate into real sinkhole. Finally, a data association method is implemented to do sinkhole tracking job. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed system. Section 3 shows some experimental results. Future work and discussion are given in Section 4.
II. PROPOSED METHOD
Our proposed method consists of three main components: candidate sinkhole segmentation, sinkhole classiﬁcation, and sinkhole tracking, which is described in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst component in our system is sinkhole segmentation which is a binary segmentation based on the temperature characteristic of sinkhole. This component receives an infrared image and outputs candidate sinkhole location in given video frame. The

binary segmentation has been done by the fact that the temperature of sinkhole is much lower than the temperature of surrounding areas. The second component is a sinkhole classiﬁer which uses transfer learning technique to classify the candidate sinkhole into the real sinkhole. In order to deal with the data association problem in real-time sinkhole tracking, we use Hungarian Algorithm [6]. The collected data from the sinkhole classiﬁer are assigned to the tracklets online based on data distribution in the current frame and previous frames. In addition, the problem that the classiﬁcation stage may output unstable result can be ﬁxed by our developed direction voting technique.

The heuristic ﬁlter is implemented to remove noises that appear in the binary image. The final result of sinkhole candidate segmentation is given in Fig. 2.

A. Sinkhole Candidate Segmentation
The gray scale image from the infrared camera is the input of this ﬁrst part. The segmentation algorithm detects the candidate sinkholes by looking for the cold areas in the thermal images. In order to implement this, we apply the dualthresholding method because the surrounding things may have the grayscale that is much darker than the sinkholes. The process of dual thresholding method is described as follows. I is the input image, and (x, y) is the location of a speciﬁc pixel,  and are the thresholds.

B. Sinkhole Classiﬁcation by CNN Transfer Learning
Because of enormous number of parameters, the large dataset and high computation resource are required to train CNN models. That leads to the difﬁculty when training with lack of dataset. Instead, a pre-trained model can be transferred to work on the categories which not belong to the original dataset. In this paper, the transfer learning approach has been used to train CNN sinkhole classiﬁcation model.
The ResNet [9] model was trained on the Image Net Dataset [10], which contains millions of images and 1000 object types. In this paper we have chosen ResNet50, which contains 49 convolutional layers, 1 fully connected layer and 1 classiﬁcation layer that computes for each image its classiﬁcation score across the 1000 object types. For the purpose of classifying sinkhole regions, we replaced this ﬁnal layer with a new one which has only two object kinds, sinkhole and non-sinkhole. This layer will be trained from scratch by using back-propagation ﬁne-tune approach with our dataset.
In order to train the CNN for sinkhole image classiﬁcation in the video frame, we need to prepare one dataset for training and another dataset for evaluation. Our training dataset has 7000 sinkhole images and 7000 non-sinkhole images, while our evaluation dataset has 1000 images for each class. The non-sinkhole images could be regular object in the video frames which have similar surface temperature with real sinkhole like vehicles, humans, or trees; they can also simply be background images. The resulting accuracy of the trained CNN classiﬁer was more than 99%.
C. Sinkhole Tracking by HA Algorithm
After having sinkhole detected and recognized from the CNN classiﬁer, the problem of tracking is to assign sinkhole to respective tracklets which are the trajectory of objects in consecutive frames. In order to solve this problem, we have implemented Hungarian Algorithm (HA) for data association. Suppose that we have N detected sinkhole in a video frame, the problem is how to identify the tracklet that each detected sinkhole belongs to. The detected sinkhole is assigned bases on

the score that calculated by using correlation between image of detected sinkhole and image of sinkhole in the tracklet. It is obvious that the correlation score is high, then the probability the sinkhole belongs to the respective tracklet is high. The HA method works only on the correlation score matrix which includes all distances between detected sinkholes and tracklets. There are several steps in HA method, which include matrix subtraction, matrix addition and zero element finding. The HA method is implemented to find optimal assignment solution in this paper because of its speed and simplicity to apply to the real time application.
The dataset that we collected is the video captured from drone. Therefore, the sinkhole and other objects are stationary, only the camera was moving, thus the video was not stable. Sometimes, the segmentation and classiﬁcation step are failed to detect the real sinkhole in the image. In that case, we will use the previous sinkhole location in the previous frame with a small translating distance to place into the current frame. The translating distance will be calculated based on the optical ﬂow algorithm. This translation correction has been done by assuming that all sinkholes in the video frame should be moving in the same direction. This approach will help the system to overcome the problem of missing sinkhole in the detection and recognition process. If in the video frame no sinkhole is detected, then the tracklet will reset, and when waiting for the sinkhole to appear again.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In order to evaluate the proposed sinkhole tracking system, we have been used the collected videos captured from the drone. The input videos are segmented into training set and testing set. To evaluate the performance, we estimated the average detection precision (AP) and average recall (AR) by following the equation (6), (7).

Where TP is the number of true positives, FN is the number of false negatives, and FP is the number of false positives in the dataset. Based on the overlapping threshold we can ﬁnd when a detected sinkhole is FP or TP. a FP is achieved by testing all detected sinkholes of the test data that overlapping by less than the overlapping threshold with a ground-truth sinkhole, and a TP is achieved by testing all detected sinkhole in the test data that overlapping by more than the overlapping threshold with a ground-truth sinkhole.

TABLE I. ACCURACY EVALUATION

overlapping threshold 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6

AR 93.2% 92.0% 88.7% 86.6%

AP 94.1% 92.4% 89.0% 87.4%

The AR and AP of proposed method is given in the table 1. It is obvious that when the overlapping threshold is increased, the AP and AR score of proposed method are decreased. In

general, the overlapping threshold = 0.5 is commonly used in the literature to evaluate performance of tracking method.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed an approach, which is the combination of CNN object classiﬁer and HA data association to efﬁciently do real-time sinkhole tracking with the hardware conﬁguration. Experimental results show that the proposed method is achieved 89% and 88.7% for AP and AR respectively at overlapping threshold of 0.5. Our proposed method has experienced some weaknesses that when the input video is not stable, the segmentation step is failed to detect to potential sinkhole candidate. In addition, the classiﬁer performance is not good in some cases when the input potential candidates are missing from the training set. In spite of some weaknesses, our proposed method shows promising result which is suitable for practical applications such as surveillance system using infrared camera. Our future plan should overcome challenge of lacking dataset.
