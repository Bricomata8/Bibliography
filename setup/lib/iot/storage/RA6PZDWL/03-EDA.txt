Ask an interesting question.

What is the scientiﬁc goal? What would you do if you had all the data? What do you want to predict or estimate?

Get the data.

How were the data sampled? Which data are relevant? Are there privacy issues?

Explore the data.

Plot the data. Are there anomalies? Are there patterns?

Model the data.

Build a model. Fit the model. Validate the model.

Communicate and visualize the results.

What did we learn? Do the results make sense?
Can we tell a story?

Data Exploration
Not always sure what we are looking for (until we ﬁnd it)

Example: Antibiotics Will Burtin, 1951

What Questions?

How effective are the drugs?

Gram Positive
If bacteria is gram positive, Penicillin & Neomycin are
most effective

Gram Negative
If bacteria is gram negative, Neomycin is most effective
M. Bostock, Protovis after W. Burtin, 1951

How do the bacteria compare?
Not a streptococcus! (realized ~30 years later)
Really a streptococcus! (realized ~20 years later)
Wainer & Lysen, “That’s funny...” American Scientist, 2009

Exploratory Data Analysis
“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.”
John Tukey

Visualization
To convey information through   graphical representations of data

Visualization Goals
Communicate (Explanatory)
Present data and ideas Explain and inform Provide evidence and support Inﬂuence and persuade
Analyze (Exploratory)
Explore the data Assess a situation Determine how to proceed Decide what to do
