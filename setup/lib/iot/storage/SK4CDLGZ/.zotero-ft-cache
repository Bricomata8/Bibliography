Abstract— This paper delineates a new method of determining the coordinates of sensors with a single beacon for both the parallel and non-parallel state situations. CayleyMenger determinant is mostly used when the beacon and deployed sensors are in the state of parallel planes. We have, however, proposed a mathematical model to compute the coordinates of the submerged sensors even when these sensors and beacon are in non-parallel state configuration. As the knowledge of precise coordinates of the sensors is as important as the collected data in underwater wireless sensor networks, the measure of exact distance between the nodes becomes the prime factor for improved accuracy. The proposed mathematical model of coordinate-determination has better immunity from multipath fading and linearization process of non-linear equations, resulting in more precise location of the sensors. Moreover, a single beacon is used to determine the coordinates of the sensor nodes where none of them have a priori knowledge about their locations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Not long past since researchers have shown fervent interest to explore and fulfil the needs of a multitude of underwater applications, even though terrestrial wireless communication applications have established its prominence. Underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) is envisioned to enable application for oceanographic data collection and offshore exploration for the profusion of wealth underwater world has. It’s not only the wealth; marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet at a very fundamental level and for its sustenance. It, therefore, becomes crucial to obtain accurate environmental data using underwater sensors to provide and maintain sanctuary for the marine life. Besides, advanced robot navigation, autonomous underwater vehicle control and surveillance, finding lost objects, estuary monitoring and pollutant tracking also require accurate localization [1]. In addition to underwater sensors, UWSN may also comprise of surface stations and autonomous underwater vehicles. Regardless of the type of deployment and configuration, the location of sensors needs to be determined for meaningful interpretation of the sensed data [2].
Despite varieties of application of UWSN, idea of submerged wireless communication may still seem far-fetched and got attention of researchers since last decades. As

positions of submerged sensors play a vital role for the significance of validity of data, determining the coordinate precisely is very crucial. In UWSNs, acoustic channels are naturally exploited as range measurements using acoustic signals are much more accurate than using radio signals [1, 3]. However, impacts of multipath effects and accurate time synchronization have been the most challenging factors.
In [4], Duff and Muller proposed a method to solve the multilateration equations by means of nonlinear least square optimization when no positions are known. The algorithm is based on a degree-of-freedom analysis – which states enough measurement from different positions will provide enough equations to solve the problem. In [5], a technique is used incorporating extended Kalman filter. However, the degree-offreedom analysis does not guarantee a unique solution in a system of nonlinear equations, such as trilateration, when the only data available is the distance measured between the nodes [6]. In [7], Guevara et al. introduced a new closed-form solution where no position information of any nodes is required to determine the positions of multiple static beacon nodes, the only information they used is the distance measurement between static beacons and mobile node.
Having critically analyzed the various studies discussed above, in this paper we propose a closed-form solution to determine the coordinates of the submerged sensors having only one beacon node at the surface using both radio and acoustic signals. The precise conditions for obtaining initial subsets of nodes were justified using rigidity theory in [6]. Section II explains the proposed mathematical model to determine the coordinates of sensors for both parallel and nonparallel state situation. Section III covers the simulation and discussions, and finally conclusions are given in Section IV.
II. COORDINATES COMPUTATION
A. Coordinates with Respect to the Sensor (Parallel plane state)
The objective of localization algorithms is to obtain the exact positions of all the submerged sensors by measuring distances between beacon and nodes. Only measurement available here to compute is the distance and typically it is considered as optimization problem where objective functions to be minimized have residuals of the distance equations. The variables of any localization problem are the 3D coordinates of

the nodes, where in principle more number of distance equations is needed than number of variables to solve. However, this approach known as degree-of-freedom analysis may not guarantee the unique solution for a nonlinear system.
Trilateration or multilateration techniques are usually applied in nonlinear system to determine the locations or coordinates of the sensors in partial or full. According to Guevara et al. [7] the convergence of optimization algorithms and Bayesian methods depend heavily on initial conditions used and they circumvent the convergence problem by linearizing the trilateration equations.
Fig. 1 shows the initial subset composed of the beacon node S j , j  4,5....9 and three sensor nodes Si ,i  1,2,3 . Without
loss of generality, a coordinate system can be defined using
one of the sensor nodes Si as the origin 0,0,0of the coordinate
system. The following method of coordinates determination of submerged sensors with a single beacon have been devised in [8].

we need at least six measurements to solve this system of

linear equations, which could be done following the same

procedure steering the beacon node S j , j  4,5....9 to six

different locations and measuring the distances in the vicinity

of S4 as in Figure 1.

Then, the system of equations can be written as: AX=b,

The distances between beacon and sensors d14,d24,d34.... which are known (measured) data, and inter-sensor distances d12,d13,d23 and the volume of tetrahedron Vt (formed by the beacon and sensors) are unknown. Based on the local positioning system configuration of Fig. 1, we need to write equations that will include all known and unknown distances. For that matter, we express the volume of tetrahedron Vt using Cayley-Menger determinant as following [8]:

B. Coordinates with Respect to the Beacon (Parallel plane state)
Up to now we have been able to determine the coordinates of the sensor nodes with respect to S1 . In order to find the coordinate with respect to the beacon node we follow the following steps.

Plane created by 3 AUVs

Fig. 2. Parallel plane state scenario
We assume that with the use of appropriate sensors, the depth h in Fig. 2 can be measured as depicted in [9]. After measuring the vertical distance h in between the beacon node
S4 x4 , y4 , z4  and the XY plane, we can assume the projected coordinate of the beacon node S4 x4 , y4 , z4  on the plane XY
is P4 (x4 , y4 ,0) . To find x4 and y4 , we can apply trilateration in the following manner assuming the distances between S1, S2 , S3 and P4 are D14 , D24 and D34 respectively and device following relations.

D124  x42  y42

(3)

  D224  x42  y4  y2 2

(4)

D324  x4  x3 2  y4  y3 2

(5)

From (3), (4) and (5) we obtain the projected beacon’s coordinates P4 (x4 , y4 ,0) , where

  x4

As d14 , d 24 and d34 are the hypotenuse of the S1P4S4 ,

S2P4S4 and S3P4S4 respectively, so it is possible to obtain

D14 , D24 and D34 using Pythagorean theorem. So the
coordinate of the beacon node S4 x4 , y4 , z4  would be x4 , y4 ,h

where all the elements are known.

C. Mathematical Model for Non-Parallel Planes State
Previous section assumes the plane that is created by the three underwater sensors and the plane (water surface) on which the beacon surfs while taking distance measurements were assumed to be in parallel state. In case of non-parallel plane situation, aforesaid mathematical model will be followed with additional adjustment as depicted in this section. Fig. 3 shows the scenario when the two planes are in non-parallel state. Where the planes are defined by;
S1,S2 ,S3 : (a1x  b1 y  c1z  1  0)

527

which is created by the underwater deployed sensors S1 , S2

and S3 ; and the plane

: Beacon

(a2

x



b2 y



c2 z

 2



0)

which is where the beacon surfs around i.e., water surface.

The situation as in Fig. 3 would be more common in the

real world scenario, unless if AUV/UUVs are used to maintain

a specific depth as in Fig. 2 or if an artificial water container is

used where the bottom surface is always parallel with the

water surface. Regardless of the situation, if the depth of any

of the sensors is different than the others we could conclude

that both the planes are in non-parallel state.

The system of equations mentioned in previous sections is only valid if the planes are in parallel state; because the volume of multiple tetrahedrons created by three sensors and the multiple apexes (different beacon’s positions) are equal. The variation in vertical distance will depend on the dihedral angle α as in (6) and changes can be minimized if the beacon’s positions are in close proximity while measuring distances. As the proposed method requires six distance measurements from beacon to underwater sensors, the total process should be done in quicker fashion so that the mobility of the sensors will not contribute more errors in coordinates that are being determined.

As mentioned earlier, all the deployed sensors or nodes will be equipped with a pressure sensor, which will read pressure. Once the pressure reading is sent to beacon, it will be converted in to depth measurement. Once all the depth of the sensors is determined the following method could be applied to determine the coordinates as depicted in Fig. 4.

where nˆ1  (a1,b1,c1) and nˆ2  (a2,b2,c2 ) are normal vector to the planes.

Fig. 4. Determination of coordinates for non-parallel planes state

Let the depths of the deployed sensors are h1 , h2 and h3 for the
sensors S1 , S2 and S3 respectively, where assuming h3  h2  h1 ,
then S1 is the highest point among all the three sensors with depth h1 . So the plane Πs1,s2,s3 created by three points S1 , S2 and S3 would be in non-parallel state with the plane Πbeacon(water surface).
Let that highest point be S1 , where S1  S1 , we also imagine two more points S2 and S3 with depth same as h1 right above S2 and S3 respectively. Since S2 and S3 are right above S2 and
S3 , x and y component of its coordinates will be same as S2 and S3 respectively, only z component of the coordinates will be different. So the plane Πs1' s2' s3' and plane Πbeacon would be in parallel state. For S4S2 p2 , where p2 is the projection of
S2 , and d24 is the measured distance which would be taken
according to the process discussed in [10]; h2 is measured depth from built-in pressure sensor associated with deployed nodes. So l2 i.e. the distance between p2 and S4 , can be calculated as:

Same technique and procedure will be followed to find the

distance between S4 and imaginary point S3 . Once all distances

from beacon S4 to imaginary points S2 and S3 are calculated,

section II will be followed to determine coordinates of S1 , S2

and S3. Table II shows the determined coordinates of the

sensors for parallel state with respect to the beacon S4 . Table

III shows the computed coordinates of sensors S1 , S2 and S3

for non-parallel state.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In order to validate the mathematical model, the proposed method has been simulated using Matlab in [11]. A group of three sensors are placed at (0,0,0), (0,75,0), and (80,40,0) and the mobile beacon moved randomly in a plane, which is parallel to the bottom plane where the sensors are deployed. Simulation for coordinate determination is done for 100m water column with 30oC surface and 15oC bottom temperature having salinity variation of 0.5ppt. We have incorporated

Gaussian noise (μ=0, σ=1) to 15oC bottom temperature and to the flight time Tij(travel) as both of them have more

To get distance measurement from six different positions of the beacon, it has been moved around in six different coordinates randomly within close proximity. However, mobility of the sensors is not considered in the proposed mathematical model. Errors in coordinates for S2 and S3 are shown in Fig. 6 for 100 iterations. It should be noted that sensor S1 is placed at the reference coordinate (0,0,0); hence producing no error in coordinates determination for S1.

Table IV compares the positional error of sensor S2 and S3 when distances between the beacon and sensors are with and without Gaussian noise. Positional error with true Euclidean distance is almost negligible which validates the proposed mathematical model. This negligible error appeared even after considering true Euclidean distances are due to linearization process. It also shows that the mean distance errors for both the sensors are 0.62m and 0.75m with standard deviation of 0.478 and 0.603 respectively where Gaussian noise has been added to distance measurement only. In addition to that Fig. 7 shows positional error of sensors after incorporating Gaussian noise in distance measurements and bearings; it is conspicuous that positional errors are within acceptable range considering physical sizes of the sensors for a 100m deep water column. This result will surely improve if the outliers are not considered in simulations.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have presented a mathematical model to determine the coordinates of submerged sensors using a single beacon for both parallel state and non-parallel state scenarios. The method computes the coordinates with respect to one sensor node that alleviates a number of problems in the domain of localization. Results from simulation validate the proposed mathematical model that generates negligible error in coordinates determination of the sensors when distances between beacon and sensors are true Euclidean. The proposed method can also determine the coordinates of the deployed submerged sensors using a single surfaced beacon for a real life orientation. It further shows that coordinates are within acceptable error range when Gaussian noise is applied to distance determinations. In future study we plan to consider involuntary mobility of the sensors due to currents in the proposed model.
