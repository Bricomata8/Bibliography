Advanced systems to improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart cities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later use, to intelligent control systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously, the possible improvements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous sensing poses numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an overview of the state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical challenges associated with these technologies. In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies play a role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated with these applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies belong to different disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts to bridge these to provide a broad overview, which can be of help to researchers and developers in understanding how advanced sensing can play a role in smart cities.},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2012-12-27},\n  pages = {393-425},\n  author = {Hancke, Gerhard and Silva, Bruno and Hancke, Jr., Gerhard},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3XSTERPC/Hancke et al_2012_The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf},\n  note = {00318}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":16,"created":1563543411564,"version":0,"updated":1563545452986},"$loki":5732},{"itemID":3704,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bera_softwaredefined_2017,\n  title = {Software-{{Defined Networking}} for {{Internet}} of {{Things}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  volume = {4},\n  issn = {2327-4662},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017556/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JIOT.2017.2746186},\n  shorttitle = {Software-{{Defined Networking}} for {{Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Internet of Things Journal},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Internet Things J.},\n  urldate = {2019-03-22},\n  date = {2017-12},\n  pages = {1994-2008},\n  author = {Bera, Samaresh and Misra, Sudip and Vasilakos, Athanasios V.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/FLAE22VT/Bera et al_2017_Software-Defined Networking for Internet of Things.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":16,"created":1563543411602,"version":0,"updated":1563545453122},"$loki":5733},{"itemID":3884,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{pham_lowcost_f,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Low-Cost {{LoRa IoT}} Device: A Step-by-Step Tutorial},\n  pages = {45},\n  author = {Pham, Congduc},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/B8YCD9VI/Pham - Low-cost LoRa IoT device a step-by-step tutorial.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":16,"created":1563543411616,"version":0,"updated":1563545453230},"$loki":5734},{"itemID":4780,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{vijayakumar_adaptive_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Logic Based Jamming Detection System in {{WSN}}},\n  volume = {23},\n  issn = {1432-7643, 1433-7479},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00500-018-3636-5},\n  doi = {10.1007/s00500-018-3636-5},\n  number = {8},\n  journaltitle = {Soft Computing},\n  shortjournal = {Soft Comput},\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2019-04},\n  pages = {2655-2667},\n  keywords = {SIR},\n  author = {Vijayakumar, K.

First, we present a NS-3 module that simulates the behavior of LoRa in an accurate way. To validate the module, we compare its results with measurements on a real-world testbed and with measured values reported by other work. We also show that the module correctly represents the capture effect that lowers the packet drop rate due to collisions. Second, we want to improve the performance of LoRa devices while not impacting energy consumption, the aspect that usually is not taken into account in the literature. We use the simulator to evaluate CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), a simple enhancement to LoRaWAN that lowers the collision ratio. The simulation results show that CSMA considerably lowers the collision ratio while only slightly increasing energy consumption. We also observe that CSMA presents lower energy consumption than LoRa for a large number of devices. Another advantage of CSMA consists of increased throughput and larger network capacity because the ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle do not longer apply.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}} 2018)},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-13},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  pages = {1-7},\n  keywords = {PDR,Tx},\n  author = {To, Thanh-Hai and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SSLB3I38/To and Duda - 2018 - Simulation of LoRa in NS-3 Improving LoRa Perform.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":16,"created":1563543413010,"version":0,"updated":1563545453428},"$loki":5748},{"itemID":4694,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_project_,\n  title = {Project {{SMS}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/2YRAU2YB/Project SMS - sensors_app.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":16,"created":1563543413018,"version":0,"updated":1563545453662},"$loki":5749},{"itemID":5598,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{boufenneche_formal_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Formal {{Modeling}} of {{Greedy Behavior}} in {{Secure Internet}} of {{Things Networks}}},\n  abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, objects should communicate through secure wireless channels and would be able to connect to the Internet.

Traditional Kalman filter-based INS/GPS integration schemes have several inadequacies related to sensor error model and immunity to noise. Alternatively, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks with three layers have been implemented to improve the position accuracy of the integrated system. However, MLP neural networks show poor accuracy for low-cost INS because of the large inherent sensor errors. For the first time the paper demonstrates the use of knowledge-based source difference artificial neural network (SDANN) to improve navigation performance of low-cost sensor, with or without external aiding sources. Unlike the conventional MLP or artificial neural networks (ANN), the structure of SDANN consists of two MLP neural networks called the coarse model and the difference model. The coarse model learns the input\\textendash{}output data relationship whereas the difference model adds knowledge to the system and fine-tunes the coarse model output by learning the associated training or estimation error. Our proposed SDANN model illustrated a significant improvement in navigation accuracy of up to 81\\% over conventional MLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDANN method is effective for GPS/INS integration schemes using low-cost inertial sensors, with and without GPS.},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = {Measurement Science and Technology},\n  shortjournal = {Meas.

However, a flooding based routing protocol can address these challenges with its multipath characteristics. If the network uses a flooding based routing protocol, not only DATA but also ACK messages are transmitted through multiple paths. Although the messages are transmitted through multiple paths, we cannot avoid the packet loss completely. So, in order to provide high reliability of delivering messages, we need a retransmission mechanism. Though, if the network uses conventional transport layer protocol such as TCP, it will cause a spurious retransmission problem because it was not designed for the multipath environment. To overcome this problem, we suggest Path Similarity based Spurious Retransmission Minimization over Flooding based Routing in UWSN.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-01-18},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {17-24},\n  author = {Jones, Tyler and Dali, Aniket and Rao, Manoj Ramesh and Biradar, Neha and Madassery, Jean and Liu, Kaikai},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/LPZF5AGW/Jones et al_2018_Towards a Layered and Secure Internet-of-Things Testbed via Hybrid Mesh.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543416418,"version":0,"updated":1563545452998},"$loki":5788},{"itemID":3775,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{richardson_rpl_2018,\n  title = {{{RPL}}- {{Routing}} over {{Low Power}} and {{Lossy Networks}}},\n  url = {https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/94/slides/slides-94-rtgarea-2.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-02-18},\n  date = {2018},\n  author = {Richardson, Michael},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/KQXYV8J2/slides-94-rtgarea-2.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543416432,"version":0,"updated":1563545453160},"$loki":5789},{"itemID":4472,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{baccelli_powering_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Powering the {{Internet}} of {{Things}} with {{RIOT}}: {{Why}}? {{How}}? {{What}} Is {{RIOT}}?},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Baccelli, Emmanuel and Schleiser, Kaspar},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/PYP3R48U/Baccelli and Schleiser - Powering the Internet of Things with RIOT Why Ho.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543416446,"version":0,"updated":1563545453558},"$loki":5790},{"itemID":5846,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{khalid_sensing_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Sensing and {{Utilization}} of {{Spectrum}} with {{Cooperation Interference}} for {{Full}}-{{Duplex Cognitive Radio Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Full duplex (FD) radios in cognitive radio (CR) networks enable secondary users (SUs) to perform sensing and transmission simultaneously, and improve the utilization of spectrum.

We report on data gathered with four capture devices from nearly 50 experimental runs conducted with vehicles on a rural highway. Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\\% of overall throughput, 15\\% of the time. (2) We quantify the effects of ten problems caused by the mechanics of existing protocols that are responsible for this throughput loss; and (3) We recommend best practices for using vehicular opportunistic connections. Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be significantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP. The central message in this paper is that wireless conditions in the vicinity of a roadside access point are predictable, and by exploiting this information, vehicular opportunistic access can be greatly improved.},\n  eventtitle = {The 5th International Conference},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on {{Mobile}} Systems, Applications and Services  - {{MobiSys}} '07},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-30},\n  date = {2007},\n  pages = {206},\n  author = {Hadaller, David and Keshav, Srinivasan and Brecht, Tim and Agarwal, Shubham},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XNDIFU6Z/Hadaller et al. - 2007 - Vehicular opportunistic communication under the mi.pdf},\n  note = {00273}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543416998,"version":0,"updated":1563545453634},"$loki":5797},{"itemID":5106,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{yang_smart_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Smart Wireless Paging Sensor Network}} for {{Elderly Care Application Using LoRaWAN}}},\n  volume = {18},\n  issn = {1530-437X, 1558-1748, 2379-9153},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8466790/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JSEN.2018.2870674},\n  abstract = {Long range wide area network (LoRaWAN) is increasingly gained much attention due to its advantages in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) application. The message delivery between participated nodes and gateway in the WSNs affects the quality of service (QoS) such as energy consumption and the successful delivery rate (SDR). In this paper, we present a novel packet transmission model for a smart wireless paging sensor network (WPSN) based on LoRaWAN, which supports a real-time elderly care application. The model is used to investigate the performance of star topology communication on elderly care via Markov discrete-time M/M/1 queuing system. The proposed traffic model enables the performance evaluation of WPSN for elderly care. Moreover, an optimal cluster allocation policy is proposed by which maximizing SDR are obtained and QoS constraint requirements are met in terms of energy consumption. We conduct analytic analysis and simulation to exploit the QoS of LoRa based WSNs for elderly care application. The proposed WPSN is experimental studied and validated in a real elder care scenario.

In this context, characteristics of visual sensors and conditions of the monitored environment, as well as the status of other concurrent monitoring systems, may affect how visual sensors collect, encode and transmit information. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based approach to dynamically configure the way visual sensors will operate concerning sensing, coding and transmission patterns, exploiting different types of reference parameters.

In this paper we consider a scenario with a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas serving four users, clustered into two groups of two users each, equipped with a single antenna. This simple but relevant scenario allows to capture the main features of NOMA systems, where in each cluster the user having the best channel applies successive interference cancellation (SIC) to remove the signal intended for the other user in the same cluster, while the other user treats interference as noise. Moreover interference among the two clusters also is treated as additional noise. In this scenario we address the problem of beamformer design and power allocation for the four users with the aim of minimizing the total transmit power while satisfying a minimum rate constraint for each user. Starting from the zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) beamformers we propose five solutions based on suitable combinations of fixed beamformers to simplify the beamformer design and power allocation.

VCC brings the mobile cloud model to vehicular networks and thus changes the way of network service provisioning, whereas ICN changes the notion of data routing and dissemination. We envision a new vehicular networking system, Vehicular Cloud Networking, on top of them. This article scrutinizes its architecture and operations and discusses its design principles.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Magazine},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa.

On the physical layer, simulation results show that an ultra narrowband network has a larger coverage, while wideband spread spectrum networks are less sensitive to interference. When considering the contention between nodes and interference between different networks, simulations show that adaptation of frequency and modulation is imperative for efficiently dealing with varying contention and interference in long range unlicensed networks.

That is why, IoT is presently spanning over a diverse range of applications in the fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, military, industry, etc. The resources IoT requires in those applications are heterogeneous in nature, for example, storage, processor, network, sensor nodes, energy, etc. The obvious challenge is how to manage these limited resources efficiently. Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed.

However, routing in IP networks are relatively inflexible. Flows can follow only shortest paths toward their destinations. In contrast, Software Defined Networking (SDN) offers finegrained control over routing, at the expense of controller overhead, failover latency, and deployment challenges. The best choice is to combine both approaches to achieve ``central control over the distributed route computation'' paradigm. Recently a new idea called Fibbing is proposed to realize flexible fine-grained control in conventional IP networks. Fibbing as an alternative loop-free destination based solution brings the flexibility for traditional networks without changing router configurations and/or protocols. The Fibbing controller can steer a traffic flow to follow any specific route. However, how to achieve traffic engineering through dynamic traffic monitoring and route computation is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a framework to achieve an optimized load balancing solution for a Fibbing controlled network. In our system, there are a light weight traffic monitoring module, a demand estimation module, and an optimization engine for routing path computation. The system periodically determines a set of routing paths to the Fibbing controller for path provisioning. In order to evaluate the performance, we have implemented the whole system in a testbed. The experimental results show that the average time for file transfer is significantly reduced with the support of the proposed system.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {154-158},\n  author = {Zanjani, Saeed Barkabi and Li, Kuang-Yi and Lee, Steven S.

WiFi fingerprinting, which estimates the user's locations using precollecting WiFi signals as references, is of particular interest since these days, every user can easily access to WiFi networks. Among numerous methods, deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods have shown an attractive performance but their major drawback is the sensitivity to the fluctuation of received signals (caused by multipaths). To yield a satisfactory performance, thus, a sufficiently large number of possible cases should be trained, which costs a lot. In this paper, we address the above problem by presenting a convolutional neural network (CNN) based localization method. As success in image classifications, the proposed method can be robust to the small changes of received signals as it exploits the topology of a radio map as well as signal strengths.

In this paper, we propose a receiver-initiated consecutive packet transmission WuR (RI-CPT-WuR) medium access control (MAC) protocol, which eliminates multiple competitions to achieve higher energy efficiency. Furthermore, we develop two associated discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs) for evaluating the performance of RI-CPT-WuR and an existing RI-WuR MAC protocol.

The application of intelligence in IoT, known as Cognitive IoT (CIoT), will enable decision making based on historical data, and automatically train, learn and troubleshoot future issues. This project proposes a smart energy monitoring system for home appliances incorporating CIoT which consists of three parts. Firstly, a Raspberry Pi-based smart plug serving as the gateway, that is able to read current data from individual home appliances, load the trained model from training server and test the verified data using the model. Secondly, Google Colab as the training server will be used to store the training data set and building the Tensorflow-based Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model. This recurrent neural network model will forecast electricity bill and notify users if abnormal energy consumption of individual home appliances is detected. Thirdly, a dashboard using Matplotlib library where users may monitor the real-time energy consumption. The completed LSTM model demonstrates a high accuracy of more than 80\\%, where a low mean squared error with train score = 0.1798 and test score = 0.1229 is determined.

We mount the sensors on a specially designed hexagonal plate, while considering each camera-LIDAR combination as an independent multi-sensor unit. For each unit, we simultaneously capture chessboard images and their three-dimensional (3D) point data at a few different orientations. Twodimensional (2D) chess corners are reprojected into 3D space for plane fitting. RANSAC algorithm is applied on LIDAR points before they are used for plane fitting. The mutual rotation between the camera and LIDAR is calculated by aligning the normal vectors of plane fitting results. An arbitrary point from the camera plane is projected on to the LIDAR plane and the distance is minimized to estimate the mutual translation. The accuracy of this proposed method is evaluated through scene fusion experiments.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Kim, Eung-su and Park, Soon-Yong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6R988DU4/Kim and Park - Extrinsic calibration of a camera-LIDAR multi sens.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543422582,"version":0,"updated":1563545454366},"$loki":5855},{"itemID":5672,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{nam_ber_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {{{BER Analysis}} of {{Wavelength Division Multiplexing}}-{{Based Multiple Beam Scheduling Scheme Based}} on {{Gamma Approximation Channel}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436739/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436739},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we statistically analyze the BER performance of a threshold-based parallel multiple beam selection scheme for a free-space optical (FSO) based system with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in cases where a pointing error has occurred under Gamma turbulence conditions, which are a good approximation of Gamma-Gamma distribution.

A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security.

To achieve low power consumption, every node periodically schedules its radio transceiver into sleep or active state, which is usually called duty cycle mechanism in MAC protocol. In this paper, we design a novel Prediction-Based Asynchronous MAC protocol (PBA-MAC) for heavy traffic load in wireless sensor networks. PBA-MAC applies an efficient wakeup mechanism to save the energy of a sensor node as much as possible. It reduces communication cost by enabling a sender to predict the intended receiver's wakeup time, without introducing unnecessary idle listening or overhearing cost. In addition, it introduces an exponential advance mechanism to handle the prediction error caused by clock drift and hardware platform latency. More importantly, its backcast-based retransmission characteristic can efficiently resolve severe wireless collisions caused by concurrent traffic flows. The PBA-MAC is implemented in Contiki operating system. We compare PBA-MAC to some existing energy-efficient MAC protocols. The experimental results show that PBAMAC significantly improves network energy efficiency and reduces packet delivery latency even under heavy traffic load.},\n  journaltitle = {AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications},\n  shortjournal = {AEU - Int.

Although it is a common belief that this figure could shrink with the use of new sensor and communication technologies, unfortunately, none such systems have hit the road to date. Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we fill this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system specifically devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios. Our experiments confirm what has been observed before in theory and simulation, i.e., the use of such a system can reduce, by as much as 40\\%, the amount of vehicles involved in highway pileups.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

However, in the conventional method, the P-QRS-T wave must be accurately detected, and the feature value is extracted through the P-QRS-T wave. If an error occurs in the peak detection or feature extraction process, the accuracy becomes very low. Therefore, in this paper, we implement a system that can perform PVC (Premature Ventricular Contraction) and PAC (Premature Atrial Contraction) classification by using P-QRS-T peak value without feature extraction process using deep neural network.

Many Electronic Control Units (ECUs) have been installed in the vehicle to support ADAS, and massive data stream flows over the in-vehicle network. Therefore, the Ethernet backbone, which can guarantee the high bandwidth, has emerged as an in-vehicle communication technology. However, security on automotive Ethernet has not yet been proposed. The IEEE MACsec with IEEE 802.1X Authentication and Key Management (AKM) may be applied for the in-vehicle secure communication, but it has a constraint that its security scope is based on a point-to-point approach. Whenever a frame arrives at the switches in the transmission path, the decryption and reencryption of the frame are repeated. It may adversely affect the performance of ADAS related to the driver's safety by increasing the end-to-end latency. We therefore propose a new MACsec extension over the Software-Defined Networks (SDN) for an invehicle secure communication, which is based on IEEE 802.1X authentication mechanism. The proposed scheme extends the security scope of MACsec from point-to-point to end-to-end by delegating AKM process of ECUs and switches to SDN controller. It could minimize the cryptographic processes of the ECUs and switches without any modification of the existing MACsec standard, and could protect an automotive system from any manipulation by unauthorized third parties. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is applicable for an invehicle secure communication.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {180-185},\n  author = {Choi, Ju-Ho and Min, Sung-Gi and Han, Youn-Hee},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/BT95RT8N/Choi et al. - 2018 - MACsec Extension over Software-Defined Networks fo.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543424586,"version":0,"updated":1563545454694},"$loki":5878},{"itemID":5842,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kim_implement_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Implement of 100-{{Gbps}} Optical Transceiver firmware for Optical Communication Systems},\n  abstract = {In this paper, an efficient firmware design scheme is proposed for a 100-Gbps CFP(C form-factor pluggable) optical transceiver.

The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa configuration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the traffic intensity. The comparison shows the benefits of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its configuration according to its link budget.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-30},\n  date = {2018-10},\n  pages = {192-199},\n  author = {Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Suraty, Luiz and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/CN8P8U28/Ochoa et al. - 2018 - Large Scale LoRa Networks From Homogeneous to Het.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543424824,"version":0,"updated":1563545453296},"$loki":5881},{"itemID":4698,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_vehicular_b,\n  title = {Vehicular {{Networks C2X}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/YKYTDQ7S/Vehicular_Networks_C2X.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543424830,"version":0,"updated":1563545453668},"$loki":5882},{"itemID":4952,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{piyare_ultra_24,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Ultra {{Low Power Wake}}-{{Up Radios}}: {{A Hardware}} and {{Networking Survey}}},\n  volume = {19},\n  issn = {1553-877X},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7990121/},\n  doi = {10.1109/COMST.2017.2728092},\n  shorttitle = {Ultra {{Low Power Wake}}-{{Up Radios}}},\n  abstract = {In wireless environments, transmission and reception costs dominate system power consumption, motivating research effort on new technologies capable of reducing the footprint of the radio, paving the way for the Internet of Things. The most important challenge is to reduce power consumption when receivers are idle, the so called idle-listening cost. One approach proposes switching off the main receiver, then introduces new wake-up circuitry capable of detecting an incoming transmission, optionally discriminating the packet destination using addressing, then switching on the main radio only when required. This wake-up receiver technology represents the ultimate frontier in low power radio communication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review of the research progress in wake-up radio (WuR) hardware and relevant networking software. First, we present an overview of the WuR system architecture, including challenges to hardware design and a comparison of solutions presented throughout the last decade. Next, we present various medium access control and routing protocols as well as diverse ways to exploit WuRs, both as an extension of pre-existing systems and as a new concept to manage low-power networking.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area.

Edge Computing for mobile networks is a new technology which is currently under standardization providing an IT service environment and cloud-computing capabilities at the edge of the mobile network in close proximity to the mobile end users. The aim of this technology is to reduce latency, ensure highly efficient network operation and service delivery, providing improved user experience. All of these can be translated into value and can create opportunities for operators, application and content providers enabling them to better utilize the mobile broadband capabilities. Furthermore, edge computing enables a new value chain for end users but also for industries allowing to efficient deliver their applications over the mobile network providing fresh business opportunities and new use cases. FEC is a feedback free error recovery method where the sender introduces redundant data in advance with the source data enabling the recipient to recover from different arbitrary packet losses. Recently, the adoption of FEC error control method has been boosted by the introduction of the powerful RaptorQ Application Layer FEC (AL-FEC) codes. In this work we propose the integration of ALFEC error protection application at the edge layer.

The experimental results shows that using canny edge detector after enhancing the image by contourlet transform along with an enhancement function, the brain MRI image can be segmented very efficiently which can outperforms other conventional methods.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {798-800},\n  author = {Akter, Lata Ayesha and Kwon, Goo-Rak},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/I7JEXQZK/Akter and Kwon - 2018 - Integration of Contourlet Transform and Canny Edge.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543425640,"version":0,"updated":1563545455154},"$loki":5895},{"itemID":3304,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{alvear_validation_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Las Vegas, NV, USA}},\n  title = {Validation of a Vehicle Emulation Platform Supporting {{OBD}}-{{II}} Communications},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-6390-4},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7158092/},\n  doi = {10.1109/CCNC.2015.7158092},\n  abstract = {In the next few years, important developments are expected in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) area. One of the key issues enabling future solutions is achieving an effective integration between mobile apps and vehicles. Such integration can be efficiently achieved on all existing vehicles by relying on the On Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) interface. This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  pages = {880-885},\n  author = {Alvear, Oscar and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan-Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3Y6VC32N/Alvear et al_2015_Validation of a vehicle emulation platform supporting OBD-II communications.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543425846,"version":0,"updated":1563545452928},"$loki":5896},{"itemID":3978,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_contiki_c,\n  title = {Contiki: {{MQTT}}-and-{{CoAP}}},\n  url = {http://www.cea-iot.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Day-4-Contiki-MQTT-and-CoAP.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-04-19},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/R4E9RSXH/Day-4-Contiki-MQTT-and-CoAP.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543425854,"version":0,"updated":1563545453272},"$loki":5897},{"itemID":5653,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{datta_virtual_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Virtual {{Reality Mobile Application Testing}} in a {{5G Testbed}}},\n  abstract = {This paper describes an experiment for a Virtual Reality (VR) mobile application testing in a 5G testbed.

It can help or provide packet forwarding and other network functions. With the development of Internet and the emergence of software-defined networking (SDN), the methods designed for the traditional 5-dimensional rule set is not sufficient to process the current rule set that contains rules of 12 or more dimensions. The main problem is to process the rule sets of 12 or more dimensions in high throughput. To achieve high throughput, we study the implementations on GPU where some use a single hash table and others use Binary Range Tree to process the searching. In 12dimensional rule sets defined by OpenFlow 1.0, 8 fields are in the format of exact value or wildcard, and so using the single hash table or binary range tree is not efficient. Another problem to implement packet classification on GPU is that we must transfer the input data and results via the PCI-E bus that will incur long bus latency. In this paper, we propose a modified hash table to process the fields that contain only exact value or wildcard, and use the compressing method to reduce memory consumption. On the other hand, we implement the proposed method on APU that uses Heterogeneous System Architecture to skip the bus latency. According to the experimental results on AMD A107850 APU, our method can achieve the throughput of 1814 MPPS, and can support the rule sets of more than 12K 12-dimensional rules.

Although WuR exhibits its superiority for light traffic, it is inefficient to handle high traffic load in a network. This paper makes an effort towards improving the performance of WuR under diverse load conditions with a twofold contribution. We first propose three protocols that support variable traffic loads by enabling respectively clear channel assessment (CCA), backoff plus CCA, and adaptive WuC transmissions. These protocols provide various options for achieving reliable data transmission, low latency, and energy efficiency for ultra-low power consumption applications. Then, we develop an analytical framework based on an M/G/1/2 queue to evaluate the performance of these WuR protocols.

OpenFlow protocol is a solution of SDN. In OpenFlow version 1.3, there are 40 match fields. This makes the design of switch more complicated. Casado et al. describe a new network architecture, called fabric network [2]. They separate the network elements into edge switches and core switches. Edge switches tag a label onto packet header, and core switches use this label to perform lookup. In this paper, we propose a scheme called Path\\_label switching. In this scheme, core switch only uses one field to perform lookup. In order to reduce the number of rules in edge switches, we encode the output port number of the last hop into MPLS field. We also propose a scheme to minimize the number of rules in fat-tree topology. In our scheme, the number of rules in core and aggregation switches is the same as the number of ports. We use Mininet to construct the experiments. We will show that our proposed scheme needs much less number of rules than other methods in leaf-spine and fat-tree topologies.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {191-196},\n  author = {Chang, Yeim-Kuan and Huang, Yi-Tsung and Chen, Yu-To},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/CG9AE89A/Chang et al. - 2018 - An Efficient Label-Based Packet Forwarding Scheme .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543427102,"version":0,"updated":1563545454706},"$loki":5911},{"itemID":3204,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{ren_advanced_2012,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Advanced {{Map Matching Technologies}} and {{Techniques}} for {{Pedestrian}}/{{Wheelchair Navigation}}},\n  date = {2012},\n  pages = {202},\n  keywords = {Markov,GPS,MapMatching},\n  author = {Ren, Ming},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/VTCTMZMM/Ren_Advanced Map Matching Technologies and Techniques for Pedestrian-Wheelchair.pdf},\n  note = {00013}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543427298,"version":0,"updated":1563545452856},"$loki":5912},{"itemID":5585,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{takahashi_overloaded_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Overloaded {{Wireless MIMO Switching}} for {{Secure Wireless Communication Exchanging}} to {{Untrusted Relay}}},\n  abstract = {Wireless MIMO Switch makes the information exchange among terminals by two time steps.

In the proposed wireless MIMO switch, the stations whose number is the number of antennas plus one access the relay. As a result, the relay station hardly decodes each information owing to the overloaded access. In each station, firstly, one information signal is decoded by the interference cancellation of its own signal and the zero forcing of relay filter.

This aggravates the already over-congested unlicensed radio bands, calling for new mechanisms to improve spectrum management and energy efficiency, such as transmission power control. Existing protocols are based on simplistic heuristics that often approach interference problems (i.e., packet loss, delay and energy waste) by increasing power, leading to detrimental results. The scope of this work is to investigate how machine learning may be used to bring wireless nodes to the lowest possible transmission power level and, in turn, to respect the quality requirements of the overall network. Lowering transmission power has benefits in terms of both energy consumption and interference. We propose a protocol of transmission power control through a reinforcement learning process that we have set in a multi-agent system. The agents are independent learners using the same exploration strategy and reward structure, leading to an overall cooperative network. The simulation results show that the system converges to an equilibrium where each node transmits at the minimum power while respecting high packet reception ratio constraints. Consequently, the system benefits from low energy consumption and packet delay.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2018-01-27},\n  pages = {375},\n  author = {Chincoli, Michele and Liotta, Antonio},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/G6JTECZ2/Chincoli and Liotta - 2018 - Self-Learning Power Control in Wireless Sensor Net.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543427608,"version":0,"updated":1563545453394},"$loki":5917},{"itemID":5773,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{wang_session_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Session {{Key Agreement}} for {{End}}-to-{{End Security}} in {{Time}}-{{Synchronized Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436968/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436968},\n  abstract = {Time synchronization is important for many network applications.

This mechanism implements three (3) stages to successfully identify an unknown device. Initially, the discovery and the connection of both known and unknown devices take place so as to retrieve explicitly required specifications of these devices. Sequentially, the measurement of the syntactic similarity of all the devices' specifications and the comparison among the derived results occurs. Based on these results, the estimation of the overall syntactic similarity takes place, identifying finally the device type of the connected unknown devices.

Currently, Li-Fi is emerged as highly promising as it supports high data rate and security. But it suffers from some limitations, e.g., short communication distance, low signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) etc. OCC can overcome these limitations, but it only supports lower data rate. Therefore, to provide proper solution, we propose a hybrid OCC/Li-Fi system. We are not going to use both the technologies at the same time, rather access point is selected based on fuzzy logic, considering different application scenarios.

We have also defined an algorithm for accident prediction and alerting involving vehicles and pedestrians.

The existing OFDM scheme that maps symbols to subcarriers using an inverse fast Fourier transform (iFFT) operation uses a cyclic prefix (CP) to reduce inter-symbol interference in a multipath channel, which is a disadvantage of power and spectral efficiency respectively. Therefore, this paper aims to complement the existing shortcomings for next generation high-speed communication and to design more efficient MCM system. The proposed system uses IDWT (inverse discrete wavelet transform) operation instead of iFFT operation used in conventional OFDM. A wavelet transform is an operation that filters a signal using wavelet and scaling basis functions. Therefore, we compared the bit error rate (BER), spectral efficiency, and peak to average power ratio (PAPR) performance with the conventional OFDM system through the design of OFDM system based on wavelet transform. As a result, the conventional OFDM and wavelet-OFDM exhibited the same BER performance, and wavelet-OFDM using the Discrete Meyer wavelet had the same spectral efficiency as the conventional OFDM.

The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

Use of CCN in wireless environment can cause various issues such as re-transmissions, collisions, delay and link failure. One of the key issues that affects the performance of CCN is the management of Pending Interest Table (PIT). PIT stores each broadcasted Interest packet forwarded upstream towards the content provider and is purged either when the requested content is returned or the PIT Entry Lifetime (PEL) expires. The conventional method in CCN for PEL does not considering the network impairments such as channel error, and congestion. As a result, timeout occurs, and Interest packets are re-transmitted for the chunks that have been dropped or delayed. Due to limited size of storage in wireless CCN, all new incoming Interest packets (including retransmissions) affect the performance of network by bloating PIT. In this paper, therefore, we propose a scheme that purges the PIT entries quickly by prefetching the un-obtained content in advance.

Our experimental results demonstrate that our design improves I/O bandwidth over the existing QEMU.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {846-850},\n  author = {Kim, Taehoon and Choi, Seungho and No, Jaechun and Park, Sung-Soon},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/VSB8KR6E/Kim et al. - 2018 - hyperCache A Hypervisor-Level Virtualized IO Cac.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543432450,"version":0,"updated":1563545455184},"$loki":5971},{"itemID":3789,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{yuzehuang_timeaware_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Time-{{Aware Service Ranking Prediction}} in the {{Internet}} of {{Things Environment}}},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/5/974},\n  doi = {10.3390/s17050974},\n  number = {5},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-04-11},\n  date = {2017-04-27},\n  pages = {974},\n  keywords = {Markov},\n  author = {{Yuze Huang} and {Jiwei Huang} and {Bo Cheng} and {Shuqing He} and {Junliang Chen}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/F4J2KKN8/Yuze Huang et al_2017_Time-Aware Service Ranking Prediction in the Internet of Things Environment.pdf},\n  note = {00009}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543432652,"version":0,"updated":1563545453172},"$loki":5972},{"itemID":5777,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_low_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Low {{Complexity Polar Code Decoder}} for {{HARQ Application}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436599/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436599},\n  abstract = {In this work, an incremental decoding algorithm is proposed for the punctured polar codes.

To achieve the objective of ICN, different architectures were proposed and analyzed based on the criteria of ICN, however there are still remaining issues to be resolved. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based content management framework for ICN which enables content registration, distribution, retrieval, caching, routing, and security support.

This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance. Last, the application parameters required by the smart energy scenario influence LoRa performance, but their impacts have been scarcely reported. Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that considers performance issues when establishing a LoRa network on a real-world application testbed.},\n  number = {7},\n  journaltitle = Sustainability,\n  urldate = {2019-04-29},\n  date = {2019-03-30},\n  pages = {1917},\n  keywords = {Tx},\n  author = {Kim, Dong-Hoon and Lee, Eun-Kyu and Kim, Jibum},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6Z6NW5T7/Kim et al_2019_Experiencing LoRa Network Establishment on a Smart Energy Campus Testbed.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543434070,"version":0,"updated":1563545453282},"$loki":5992},{"itemID":4937,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{shah_energy_2002,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Orlando, FL, USA}},\n  title = {Energy Aware Routing for Low Energy Ad Hoc Sensor Networks},\n  volume = {1},\n  isbn = {978-0-7803-7376-1},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/993520/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WCNC.2002.993520},\n  abstract = {The recent interest in sensor networks has led to a number of routing schemes that use the limited resources available at sensor nodes more efficiently.

To optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40\\% over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing.

In order to improve transmission capacity in visible light communication, data must be transmitted from different LEDs at the same time and received. However, a system environment with multiple LEDs may cause interference between adjacent LEDs. Generally, since a visible light communication system generally uses a luminance modulation method, when a plurality of LEDs transmit data at the same time, it is difficult to accurately detect each LED due to light scattering interference of an adjacent LED. To solve this problem, we proposed a spatial filtering technique to group multiple LEDs and to reduce the interference of grouped LED matrix.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Petri Nets}} 1989},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {1990},\n  pages = {1-29},\n  author = {Marsan, M.

While U-Bus Air is a time asynchronous wireless sensor network, packet collisions cause degradation of communication quality as the number of terminals increases. A previous research has been proposed, an appropriate transmission cycle control algorithm based on the estimated collision probability by using collected topology information at a Fusion Center (FC). By using this algorithm, the communication performance is improved by feedback from FC to each terminal. However, its communication overhead becomes large due to topology information and feedback packets, and communication efficiency is degraded. In order to solve this problem, we propose a method to autonomously control receiver beacon transmission interval by leveraging decentralized Q-Learning. In this method, each terminal transmits information of a packet holding time at the same time as responding to the beacon. Finally, each terminal utilizes Q-Learning to derive an appropriate transmission interval.

To improve transmission capacity in optical camera communications via image sensors, different data must be transmitted simultaneously from each LED. However, multiple LED light source environments for high-speed transmission can cause interference between adjacent LEDs. In this case, since the visible light communication system generally uses intensity modulation, when a plurality of LEDs transmit data at the same time, it is difficult to accurately detect the respective LEDs due to the light scattering interference of the adjacent LEDs. In order to solve these problems, we propose spectral estimation technique and pixel image signal processing technique for each LED. A threshold value is generated based on the center value of the spectrum at the center of each LED, and only the LED which is sensed above the reference value is recognized independently by the ISP. If the spectral level is below the center value, that LED is recognized as off because it is affected by the light spread of adjacent LEDs. This technique accurately recognizes multiple LED pixels and improves the total average bit error rate and throughput of the MISOOCVLC (Optical Camera Visible Light Communication) system.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {765-767},\n  author = {Han, Doohee and Lee, Kyujin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/56YUL4N3/Han and Lee - 2018 - Optical Spectrum Estimation Technique for Optical .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543434986,"version":0,"updated":1563545455134},"$loki":6007},{"itemID":4816,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{hamza_what_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {1. {{What}} Is {{Purple IoT}} ? 2. {{Architecture}} 3. {{Exploring Purple IoT}} 4. {{Concepts}} 5. {{Used Technologies}}},\n  pages = {20},\n  author = {Hamza, Jeljeli},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/Y95ILZ3R/Hamza - 1.

A lot of recent works have proved that an approach of caching at edge devices is efficient to reduce latency and alleviate backhaul load so that the probability to meet users' Quality of Service (QoS) is much higher. However, due to the selfishness of mobile users, it is hard to convince users to store contents for other users. In this regard, we consider the social connection between users in order to induce users to store contents for the social community. So, to implement the socially aware Device to Device (D2D) caching, we construct two types of graphs: i) physical D2D graph which is constructed based on users communication over D2D links and ii) logical social graph which is consist of a group of people who share the common interest. Then, we formulate socially aware D2D caching problem into Markov Decision Process (MDP). Additionally, we consider the distance and the social ties between users, and mobile devices' capacity to optimally store contents under the constraint that energy consumption of cellular link is much higher than D2D link. Finally, we solve the D2D caching problem by using Q-learning where the goal is to minimize the total energy consumption over Macrocell Base Station (MBS) and mobile devices.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Im, Han Yeo Reum and Thar, Kyi and Hong, Choong Seon},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/5BND8GHA/Im et al. - Q-Learning Based Social Community-Aware Energy Eff.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543435846,"version":0,"updated":1563545454888},"$loki":6011},{"itemID":3512,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{al-kashoash_comparison_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Comparison of {{6LoWPAN}} and {{LPWAN}} for the {{Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  volume = {13},\n  issn = {1448-837X, 2205-362X},\n  url = {https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1448837X.2017.1409920},\n  doi = {10.1080/1448837X.2017.1409920},\n  abstract = {By 2020, 50 billion devices (things) are expected to be connected to the Internet to form the Internet of Things (IoT) world.

IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities.

However, traditional wireless networks are designed with network-centric approaches where different networks have different quality of service (QoS) strategies and cannot easily cooperate with each other to serve network users. Massive network infrastructures could not assure users perceived network and service quality, which is an indisputable fact. To address this issue, we design a new framework for heterogeneous wireless networks with the principle of user-centricity, refactoring the network from users' perspective to suffice their requirements and preferences. Different from network-centric approaches, the proposed framework takes advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and virtualization technology, which will bring better perceived services quality for wireless network users. In the proposed user-centric framework, control plane and data plane are decoupled to manage the HetNets in a flexible and coadjutant way, and resource virtualization technology is introduced to abstract physical resources of HetNets into unified virtualized resources. Hence, ubiquitous and undifferentiated network connectivity and QoE (quality of experience) driven fine-grained resource management could be achieved for wireless network users.},\n  journaltitle = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  keywords = {BW},\n  author = {Lu, Zhaoming and Lei, Tao and Wen, Xiangming and Wang, Luhan and Chen, Xin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6NQXK2A6/Lu et al_2016_SDN Based User-Centric Framework for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00004}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543436382,"version":0,"updated":1563545453518},"$loki":6017},{"itemID":4778,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{preeth_adaptive_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An Adaptive Fuzzy Rule Based Energy Efficient Clustering and Immune-Inspired Routing Protocol for {{WSN}}-Assisted {{IoT}} System},\n  issn = {1868-5137, 1868-5145},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12652-018-1154-z},\n  doi = {10.1007/s12652-018-1154-z},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing},\n  shortjournal = {J Ambient Intell Human Comput},\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2018-12-17},\n  keywords = {Tx},\n  author = {Preeth, S.

The unprecedented rise in mobile data traffic puts huge burden on existing cellular networks. To tackle aforementioned issue, various solutions have been proposed in recent years. One of such working solution is mobile data offloading, which refers to the process of offloading cellular network data either to a co-existing cellular network or a third party network. A third party network can be a community network managed by its users, a Wi-Fi mesh network or a licensed band femtocell. Recently, many studies have emerged related to mobile data offloading. Hence, there is a need to have a comparative study of these techniques to understand which technique might be useful for a particular scenario at hand. This paper discusses various data offloading schemes and comprises a detailed study that we conducted on data offloading using Wi-Fi Access Points, Device-to-Device, Wireless Mesh Network, and femtocells techniques.

It is quite complex problem to solve the spectrum fragmentation. Fuzzy logic system that resembles human inference has been used for decision making for complex problem. In this paper, we propose the dynamic spectrum assignment (SA) algorithm for minimizing the fragmentation based on the fuzzy logic in EONs. To design fuzzy logic control system for the SA algorithm, we define spectrum fragmentation ratio(SFR) and time fragmentation ratio(TFR) for input membership. We also define the weight values of available spectrum blocks as output membership. The spectrum block with the minimum crisp value is selected for the spectrum assignment of connection request.

In EC substantial compute and storage resources are placed at the edge of the network, in close proximity to end users. Similarly, NDN provides an alternative to traditional host centric IP architecture which seems a perfect candidate for distributed computation. Although NDN with EC seems a promising approach for enabling future Internet, it can cause various challenges such as expiry time of the Pending Interest Table (PIT) and non-trivial computation of the edge node. In this paper we discuss the expiry time and non-trivial computation in NDN based EC. We argue that if NDN is integrated in EC, then the PIT expiry time will be affected in relation with the processing time on the edge node.

The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm attains efficient performance compared with basic schemes.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {829-833},\n  author = {Ningombam, Devarani Devi and Hwang, Suk-Seung and Shin, Seokjoo},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/NX7FJZAP/Ningombam et al. - 2018 - A Novel Resource Sharing Mechanism for Device-to-D.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543437456,"version":0,"updated":1563545455174},"$loki":6035},{"itemID":3449,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lundell_routing_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Chania, Greece}},\n  title = {A {{Routing Protocol}} for {{LoRA Mesh Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4725-7},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449743/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WoWMoM.2018.8449743},\n  abstract = {A limitation of current LoRa networks is their single-hop nature.

To facilitate these applications, we present a new routing protocol to enable mesh networking with LoRa, allowing for multihop networking between gateways to extend coverage.

The cryptography is propagated throughout the Internet by using a broadcast mechanism. The broadcast message may incur a propagation delay and duplicate transmissions. The total propagation delay is assumed to be a combination of transmission time and computational time for data verification. A mathematical programming model is formulated to address the secure broadcast problem as a minimum spanning tree problem. The objective is to minimize the processing and transmission delay through reduced duplicate transmissions. Computational experiments demonstrate proof of concept to adopt blockchain techniques.

In this article, to handle the detection performance degradation in non-Gaussian impulsive noise environments, a robust spectrum sensing scheme namely hyperbolic tangent based energy detector (HT-ED) is proposed. The proposed HT-ED is a semi-blind method which does not require any a priori knowledge about the primary user's signals. Furthermore, the HT-ED can provide a superior detection performance compared with the conventional energy detector (ED) in a wide range of non-Gaussian noises.

Therefore, the adoption of DWDM(Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) scheme, which is most advantageous for increasing the data capacity among the various optical communication network technologies proposed to date, is rapidly increasing.[1] However, because DWDM is advantageous in capacity, but requires a large number of wavelengths, DWDM SFP optical module inventory per channel can accumulate, leading to an increase in inventory costs. In order to solve this problem, we applied wavelength tunable SFP(T-SFP) which can realize more than 16 channels with one SFP module and summarized the results of study on tunable SFP.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Kim, Jongsin and Lim, Jongyoung and Telecom, SK and Gim, Gwangyong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/FND37ILM/Kim et al. - The Study on Tunable-SFP for Optical Transport Net.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543439154,"version":0,"updated":1563545455054},"$loki":6051},{"itemID":3306,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{zhao_extended_2003,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An {{Extended Kalman Filter Algorithm}} for {{Integrating GPS}} and {{Low Cost Dead Reckoning System Data}} for {{Vehicle Performance}} and {{Emissions Monitoring}}},\n  volume = {56},\n  issn = {03734633, 14697785},\n  url = {http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0373463303002212},\n  doi = {10.1017/S0373463303002212},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Navigation},\n  shortjournal = {J.

In this paper, we investigate coverage area and `dead-zone' for the localization of an indoor flying receiver (e.g. drones). For accurate positioning, VLP requires a signal from more than two transmitters. However, the signal from the minimum number of transmitters may not always be available especially in the area close to the walls leading to inaccurate positioning (the deadzone). The simulation for a typical industrial environment shows that the loss of a signal due to a dead-zone is highly dependent on the divergence angle of transmitters and the field of view of the receiver.

In this paper, we propose a new HCR, in which an energy harvesting (EH) device is additionally deployed at the primary receiver (PR) such that the PS can not only share the spectrum resources with the SS, but also harvest energy from the SS, achieving a new simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) paradigm. In the considered structure, the secondary base station (SB) can help relay the PS's signal via an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol, and a power splitting EH device is adopted at the PR. A cooperative strategy is proposed for maximizing the efficiency of the information and power transfer. We optimize two precoders at the SB (for the PS and SS, respectively) and the power splitting factor for the PR. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, it is a real challenge. To facilitate the optimization process, a precoding structure is first proposed to reduce the number of parameters. The resultant optimization problem can then be equivalently solved using a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach.

The test system uses several single board computers (SBC) with an external Wi-Fi adapter (USB), 19 SBCs are sniffing nodes (SFN) and one SBC as sending node (SN). The sniffing SBCs are placed in a cycle around the sender so that every node has the same chance to receive the simulated packets from the SN. For the control of all 20 SBCs, a self-developed software is used, which connects from the host to the clients and is used for configuring the experiments. The configuration is sent to each client and will initiate their start, so that their times are also synchronized, for this all clients are synchronised using a time server.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {358-364},\n  author = {Friess, Kristof},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/DG3CNKCW/Friess - 2018 - Multichannel-Sniffing-System for Real-World Analys.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543441976,"version":0,"updated":1563545454788},"$loki":6077},{"itemID":5752,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_monitoring_2018a,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Monitoring of {{IoT Data}} for {{Reducing Network Traffic}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436601/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436601},\n  abstract = {As IoT systems spread, a huge amount of data is generated from devices in every second.

The IoT vision is to extend the Internet into our everyday lives, so the number of connected devices and innovative applications are growing very fast to bring intelligence into\nas many domains as possible. The QoS for IoT application not only depends on the Internet network and communication\ninfrastructure, it is also impacted by the operation and performance of IoT sensing infrastructure. Therefore, the new QoS parameters such as data accuracy, sampling rate, and\ndevice availability become important for the IoT applications compared to the Internet applications. The huge number of the Internet-connected IoT devices and application, and the spontaneous traffic flow among them make the management of the quality of service complex\nacross the Internet infrastructure. On the other hand, the non-IP devices and their limited capabilities in terms of energy and transmission create the dynamic environment and hinder the direct interaction between devices and applications. The quality of service is becoming one of the critical non-functional IoT element which needs research and studies. A flexible and scalable QoS management mechanism must be implemented in IoT system to keep up with the growth rate of the Internet-connected IoT devices and applications as well as their heterogeneity and diversity. The solution should address the IoT application requirements and user satisfaction while considering the system dynamism, limitations, and characteristics. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networking which separates the control plane and the data plane of the network elements. It makes the network\nelements programmable via the centralized control plane. This approach enables more agile management and control over the network behavior. In this thesis, we take advantage of SDN technology as the future of the Internet to offer a\nflexible and adaptive QoS support scheme for the IoT services. We present an SDN-based middleware to define a QoS management framework to manage the application specific QoS\nneeds across the IoT infrastructure including transport and sensing network. Also, we propose a new QoS model that takes into account the application QoS preferences and the network\nelements status to allocate effectively the resources for the applications across SDN network while maximizing network performance.},\n  institution = {{\\'Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\\'eal}},\n  type = {masters},\n  urldate = {2019-04-11},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  author = {Meshinchi, Atefeh},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/BNHZ9XGG/Meshinchi_2018_QOS-Aware and Status-Aware Adaptive Resource Allocation Framework in SDN-Based.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543442758,"version":0,"updated":1563545453178},"$loki":6084},{"itemID":4727,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{george_reunion_2019,\n  title = {R\\'eunion {{Lancement Atelier}}\\_5\\_{{E3S}}-15 Mai 2019},\n  date = {2019},\n  author = {George, Laurent},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/EQTASLKP/Réunion Lancement Atelier_5_E3S-15 mai 2019 .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543442770,"version":0,"updated":1563545453676},"$loki":6085},{"itemID":5648,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{han_physical_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Physical {{Layer Security Improvement Using Artificial Noise}}-{{Aided Tag Scheduling}} in {{Ambient Backscatter Communication Systems}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an artificial noise-aided tag scheduling (ANTS) scheme in order to enhance physical layer security in ambient backscatter communications (ABCs), which utilize existing radio frequency (RF) signals such as TV, FM radio, Wi-Fi, and so on. In more detail, we first select the best tag based on the channel gain between a tag and a reader and then select another tag for generating artificial noise affecting an eavesdropper. Consequently, we propose a scheduling criterion to choose both information and artificial noise tags. In addition, we apply a successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique at the reader in order to eliminate the interference from the artificial noise tag. The simulation results show that our proposed ANTS scheme can obtain a better secrecy rate as the channel gain between the tag and the receiver increases and the number of tags increases. Moreover, when the number of tags is sufficiently large, the proposed ANTS scheme significantly outperforms the conventional scheme in terms of average secrecy rate.},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Han, Ji Yoon and Kim, Junsu and Kim, Su Min},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/4JZT3WDR/Han et al. - Physical Layer Security Improvement Using Artiﬁcia.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543442812,"version":0,"updated":1563545454558},"$loki":6086},{"itemID":5689,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_vehicle_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Vehicle {{Color Recognition}} via {{Representative Color Region Extraction}} and {{Convolutional Neural Network}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436710/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436710},\n  abstract = {Vehicle color recognition is one of the important part in ITS (Intelligent Transportation System).

However, the increased connectivity of everyday objects can open manifold security vectors for cybercriminals to perform malicious attacks. These threats are even augmented by the resource constraints and heterogeneity of low-cost IoT devices, which make current host-based and static perimeter-oriented defense mechanisms unsuitable for dynamic IoT environments. Accounting for all these considerations, we reckon that the novel softwarization capabilities of Telco network can fully leverage its privileged position to provide the desired levels of security. To this aim, the emerging software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) paradigms can introduce new security enablers able to increase the level of IoT systems protection. In this paper, we design a novel policy-based framework aiming to exploit SDN/NFV-based security features, by efficiently coupling with existing IoT security approaches. A proof of concept test bed has been developed to assess the feasibility of the proposed architecture. The presented performance evaluation illustrates the benefits of adopting SDN security mechanisms in integrated IoT environments and provides interesting insights in the policy enforcement process to drive future research.},\n  number = {5},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Network Management},\n  shortjournal = {Int.

Applying the concept of multiaccess edge computing architecture, as well as choreography of the service oriented architecture, the system allows seamless coordination between multiple organizations in a distributed way through standard web services. A service choreography is designed to globally model the emergency management process from the time an accident occurs until the rescue is finished. The choreography can be synthesized to generate detailed specification on peer-to-peer interaction logic, and then the specification can be enacted and deployed on cloud infrastructures.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {1-13},\n  author = {Chen, Lei and Englund, Cristofer},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XUFTNMVT/Chen_Englund_2018_Every Second Counts.pdf},\n  note = {00007}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543443408,"version":0,"updated":1563545453464},"$loki":6093},{"itemID":4550,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{saravanan_smart_2017,\n  location = {{Geneva, Switzerland}},\n  title = {Smart Water Grid Management Using {{LPWAN IoT}} Technology},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-5873-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8016224/},\n  doi = {10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016224},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{Global Internet}} of {{Things Summit}} ({{GIoTS}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{Global Internet}} of {{Things Summit}} ({{GIoTS}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Saravanan, M and Das, Arindam and Iyer, Vishakh},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WVEPTR7C/Saravanan et al_2017_Smart water grid management using LPWAN IoT technology.pdf},\n  note = {00013}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543443428,"version":0,"updated":1563545453608},"$loki":6094},{"itemID":4790,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@incollection{song_improved_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Singapore}},\n  title = {Improved {{Energy Efficient Adaptive Clustering Routing Algorithm}} for {{WSN}}},\n  volume = {812},\n  isbn = {978-981-10-8122-4 978-981-10-8123-1},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-10-8123-1_8},\n  abstract = {Routing algorithm is the key to prolong the lifetime of the overall wireless sensor network.

Unlike other protocols, the WUR-MAC takes advantage of the WUR ultra-low power listening mode leaving it permanently active to wait for incoming requests. Due to the ultra low power nature of these radio receivers, energy consumption and latency can be optimized at the same time. Energy consumption of the combined physical and MAC layer of a WUR based design is compared to efficient schedule based low power MAC protocols using the same main underlying transceiver without a wakeup radio receiver. WUR-MAC is based on proven MAC concepts but avoids complicated algorithms that are needed to synchronize nodes in traditional WSNs. Simulation results show that with typically low traffic, the average power consumption of schedule-based MACs is significantly higher than by using WUR-MAC only in the case where very low power Wakeup Receivers ({$<$}40 {$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}W always on) are used. Delay is improved in any case due to the always on nature of the Wakeup Receiver.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {IFAC Proceedings Volumes},\n  shortjournal = {IFAC Proc.

However, the limited bandwidth available for physical layer modulation in LoRa makes it unsuitable for high bit rate data transfer from devices like image sensors. In this paper, we propose a new method for mangrove forest monitoring in Malaysia, wherein we transfer image sensor data over the LoRa physical layer (PHY) in a node-to-node network model. In implementing this method, we produce a novel scheme for overcoming the bandwidth limitation of LoRa. With this scheme the images, which requires high data rate to transfer, collected by the sensor are encrypted as hexadecimal data and then split into packets for transfer via the LoRa physical layer (PHY). To assess the quality of images transferred using this scheme, we measured the packet loss rate, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) index of each image. These measurements verify the proposed scheme for image transmission, and support the industrial and academic trend which promotes LoRa as the future solution for IoT infrastructure.},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-07-02},\n  date = {2018-09-27},\n  pages = {3257},\n  author = {Jebril, Akram and Sali, Aduwati and Ismail, Alyani and Rasid, Mohd},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/GTVNDLS8/Jebril et al_2018_Overcoming Limitations of LoRa Physical Layer in Image Transmission.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543444148,"version":0,"updated":1563545454216},"$loki":6103},{"itemID":3283,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{alvear_ecosensor_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Coimbra, Portugal}},\n  title = {{{EcoSensor}}: {{Monitoring}} Environmental Pollution Using Mobile Sensors},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-2185-7},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7523519/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WoWMoM.2016.7523519},\n  shorttitle = {{{EcoSensor}}},\n  abstract = {Air pollution monitoring has become an essential requirement for cities worldwide.

The conventional cloud applications are deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) according to the application requirements and data traffic situations, and the users are controlled with out-ofband C-plane to connect to the surrounding MEC applications. For the installation of MEC in the heterogeneous cellular networks, to the best of authors knowledge, there is no research conducted on whether a business model can be established when additional fees are paid for MEC.

Cars have no power constraints and they can be instrumented with high end computational units and graphic devices. The deployment at scale of urban vehicular systems, however, requires a careful design able to consider challenges across several domains. Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our field experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA). We designed and built the components for a pollution monitoring system able to support closed-loop optimization between pollution and traffic management. Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban traffic. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-field experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.},\n  number = {8},\n  journaltitle = {Signal Processing: Image Communication},\n  shortjournal = {Signal Process.

We also present a method of predicting the future health states based on the Markov dynamics or a set of state duration statistics derived from the model parameters and data clusters. In the proposed method we design a number of HMMs, each for a set of sequences with a particular disease history of interest. They are used to predict the future health states on the basis of corresponding diseases or health problems. Health state prediction as a service can be presented with a set of potential future states and over a number of years into the future. Experimental results have shown a baseline performance of 48\\textbackslash\\% for single year prediction with a model of sixteen states with single hypothesis for the apoplexy history data set. The performance quickly increases to 70\\textbackslash\\% with two hypotheses.

In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage).

The noise simulation and bridge's short-period GPS of the monitoring displacement component of one Hz sampling frequency are used to validate the four models and the previous method. The results show that the Adaptive neural networks filter is suggested for de-noising the observations, specifically for the GPS displacement components of structures. Also, this model is expected to have significant influence on the design of structures in the low frequency responses and measurements' contents.},\n  number = {9},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-09-22},\n  pages = {24428-24444},\n  keywords = {GPS,ML},\n  author = {Kaloop, Mosbeh and Hu, Jong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TKQW8UQ7/Kaloop_Hu_2015_Optimizing the De-Noise Neural Network Model for GPS Time-Series Monitoring of.pdf},\n  note = {00010}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543448664,"version":0,"updated":1563545452944},"$loki":6148},{"itemID":3746,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{_getting_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Getting Started with the {{Contiki OS}}/{{6LoWPAN}}  on {{STM32 Nucleo}} with {{SPIRIT1}} and Sensors Expansion Boards},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {24},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/RZ3BLYY3/Getting started with the Contiki OS-6LoWPAN on STM32 Nucleo with SPIRIT1 and.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543448676,"version":0,"updated":1563545453140},"$loki":6149},{"itemID":5574,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{nishio_optimal_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Optimal {{Channel Selection Rate}} of {{Slave Terminal}} for {{Rendezvous Channel Scheme}} Based on {{Channel Occupancy Rate}}},\n  abstract = {In dynamic spectrum access based on cognitive radio, two terminals (master and slave) cannot recognize the accessing channel.

Lately, face recognition has begun to be used for security applications at specific locations as well as for authentication. Face recognition for security purposes involves human and face detection based on the image created by a fixed camera. Consequently, the success rate for face recognition is low for lowresolution cameras. To address this problem, this study proposes a face recognition method in a multi-camera environment that includes both a fixed and a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera. The proposed method involves detecting humans within the fixed camera's field of view while tracking the detected person by adjusting the PTZ camera's pan and tilt to keep the person in view. By zooming simultaneously with tracking to obtain a high-resolution facial image, the proposed method outperformed conventional face recognition methods that use only a fixed camera.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Kim, Seong-Hoon and Choi, Jin-Woo},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/Y82NB9CG/Kim and Choi - Face Recognition Method Based on Fixed and PTZ Cam.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543448942,"version":0,"updated":1563545455246},"$loki":6155},{"itemID":3853,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{pham_lowcost_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Low-Cost {{LoRa}} Gateway: A Step-by-Step Tutorial},\n  pages = {92},\n  author = {Pham, Congduc},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/GSDRCMZ8/Pham - Low-cost LoRa gateway a step-by-step tutorial.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543449128,"version":0,"updated":1563545453212},"$loki":6156},{"itemID":5700,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{wang_cooperative_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Cooperative {{Spectrum Sensing Algorithm Based}} on {{Phase Compensation}} in {{Cognitive Cloud Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436733/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436733},\n  abstract = {Spectrum sensing is the key technology in cognitive radio networks.

In this paper, we propose an urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and hidden Markov models (HMM). Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac\\- curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth\\- ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip\\- tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework.

Although LPWANs attract the interest of industry and network operators, it faces certain constraints related to energy consumption, network coverage and quality of service. In this paper we demonstrate the possibility to optimize the performance of the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, one of the most widely used LPWAN technology. We suggest that nodes use light-weight learning methods, namely, multi-armed bandit algorithms, to select the communication parameters (spreading factor and emission power). Extensive simulations show that such learning methods allow to manage the trade-off between energy consumption and packet loss much better than an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm adapting spreading factors and transmission powers on the basis of Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) values.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-13},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {521-526},\n  author = {Kerkouche, Raouf and Alami, Reda and Feraud, Raphael and Varsier, Nadege and Maille, Patrick},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/IJREFCP4/Kerkouche et al. - 2018 - Node-based optimization of LoRa transmissions with.pdf},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543449720,"version":0,"updated":1563545453448},"$loki":6166},{"itemID":5698,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{thieu_new_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {New {{Waveforms}} for {{Selective}}-{{RoI}}-{{Signaling High}}-{{Rate Optical Camera Communication System}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436703/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436703},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we briefly discuss the potential of applying hybrid waveform into Optical Camera Communication, which can simultaneously transmit both low-rate and high-rate data streams for a challenging communication channel condition such as vehicular environment.

Accordingly, there are growing needs for UAS Traffic Management (UTM) systems. In this phenomenon, various communication protocols for UTM are emerging. In this paper, especially, the application of UTM system based on Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) protocol is introduced as one of most efficient and stable protocols in environments with high-speed mobility and dynamic changing topology. Furthermore, we design a network architecture that supports direct communication among UAVs as well as UAV and ground station within the UTM framework. By applying WAVE protocol in the UTM system, it is possible to transmit messages promptly and accurately to prevent collision in the event of an emergency, and to configure the UTM system to manage all UAVs by applying a WAVE-based ad-hoc network.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {8-10},\n  author = {Park, Jong-Hong and Choi, Sung-Chan and Kim, Jaeho and Won, Kwang-Ho},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/GNTQECGD/Park et al. - 2018 - Unmanned Aerial System Traffic Management with WAV.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543450834,"version":0,"updated":1563545454590},"$loki":6171},{"itemID":2958,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{simiscuka_relay_2018,\n  title = {A {{Relay}} and {{Mobility Scheme}} for {{QoS Improvement}} in {{IoT Communications}}},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403755},\n  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) networks inter-connect billions of devices of diverse data types such as multimedia and sensor data.

In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}} ({{IMIS}})},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-06},\n  pages = {450-455},\n  author = {Kim, Wooseong and Gerla, Mario},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/U28YNY9U/Kim_Gerla_2011_NAVOPT.pdf},\n  note = {00022}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543451626,"version":0,"updated":1563545452980},"$loki":6180},{"itemID":4304,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{feltrin_lorawan_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{LoRaWAN}}: {{Evaluation}} of {{Link}}- and {{System}}-{{Level Performance}}},\n  volume = {5},\n  issn = {2327-4662},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8344411/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JIOT.2018.2828867},\n  shorttitle = {{{LoRaWAN}}},\n  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) addresses a huge set of possible application domains, requiring both short- and long-range communication technologies.

A vehicle driving on the ramp generally attempts to enter the highway without predicting the traffic condition, and commonly causes traffic congestion on highways. Traffic congestion in the highway junction is defined as the traffic situation that the transport demand in the conjunction point exceeds the bottleneck capacity and the accumulated demand remains to the bottleneck. Under traffic congestion, vehicles driving on the ramp cannot efficiently enter the highway. As a result, the waiting time of the vehicle on the ramp becomes long, and fuel consumption and CO2 emission increase due to the frequent acceleration and deceleration. In this paper, we propose a vehicular speed acceleration advisory algorithm for the vehicle on the ramp at the junction point. By recognizing the traffic condition on highways using V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication, the proposed algorithm helps to reduce the frequent acceleration and deceleration by drivers. From the simulation results, compared to the conventional driving on the ramp, we show that the proposed algorithm can decrease fuel consumption, CO2 emission under various vehicle densities.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {85-88},\n  author = {Yun, Kwang-Wook and Kim, Hyeong-Geon and Kwon, Joonho and Jeong, Han-You and Choi, Yoon-Ho},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/VWPDMM55/Yun et al. - 2018 - Vehicular Acceleration Advisory Algorithm Using V2.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543452024,"version":0,"updated":1563545454640},"$loki":6186},{"itemID":5781,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{rahman_localization_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Localization of {{Submerged Sensors}} with a {{Single Beacon}} for {{Non}}-{{Parallel Planes State}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437041/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437041},\n  abstract = {This paper delineates a new method of determining the coordinates of sensors with a single beacon for both the parallel and non-parallel state situations.

The proposed mathematical model of coordinate-determination has better immunity from multipath fading and linearization process of non-linear equations, resulting in more precise location of the sensors.

The massive deployment of such devices may overwhelm the cellular network by imposing strong constraints on the Radio Access Network (RAN) because of the radio resources' scarcity. As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would efficiently help to overcome the risk of congestion. In this paper, we proposed a novel fluid model for M2M communications, which allows gaining an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of such systems. The provided analysis of the model was used to devise a new method to estimate accurately the number of M2M devices willing to connect as well as the number of random access attempts.We proposed, then, a novel implementation of the ACB process, which dynamically computes the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions while includes a corrective action adapting the controller action based on the mismatch existing between the computed and the targeted mean load. Compared to existing approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms allow improving considerably the estimation of the number of M2M devices' arrivals, while outperforming existing techniques in terms of the number of abandons, the success and the collision probabilities, and the average access delay.},\n  eventtitle = {The 19th {{ACM International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 19th {{ACM International Conference}} on {{Modeling}}, {{Analysis}} and {{Simulation}} of {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Systems}} - {{MSWiM}} '16},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {287-291},\n  author = {Bouzouita, Meriam and Hadjadj-Aoul, Yassine and Zangar Tunisia, Nawel and Rubino, Gerardo and Tabbane, Sami},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W7VBDTD4/Bouzouita et al_2016_Dynamic Adaptive Access Barring Scheme For Heavily Congested M2M Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543452632,"version":0,"updated":1563545453128},"$loki":6192},{"itemID":4067,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_evaluation_,\n  title = {\\'Evaluation et Am\\'elioration Des Plates-Formes Logicielles Pour R\\'eseaux de Capteurs sans-Fil, Pour Optimiser La Qualit\\'e de Service et l'\\'energie},\n  url = {http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2016_0051_ROUSSEL.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-04-17},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/N8LVHV5W/DDOC_T_2016_0051_ROUSSEL.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543452642,"version":0,"updated":1563545453356},"$loki":6193},{"itemID":4584,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{grassi_navigo_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Boston, MA, USA}},\n  title = {Navigo: {{Interest}} Forwarding by Geolocations in Vehicular {{Named Data Networking}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8461-9},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7158165/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WoWMoM.2015.7158165},\n  shorttitle = {Navigo},\n  eventtitle = {2015 {{IEEE}} 16th {{International Symposium}} on \"{{A World}} of {{Wireless}}, {{Mobile}} and {{Multimedia Networks}}\" ({{WoWMoM}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE}} 16th {{International Symposium}} on {{A World}} of {{Wireless}}, {{Mobile}} and {{Multimedia Networks}} ({{WoWMoM}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-30},\n  date = {2015-06},\n  pages = {1-10},\n  author = {Grassi, Giulio and Pesavento, Davide and Pau, Giovanni and Zhang, Lixia and Fdida, Serge},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MQF8J5RG/Grassi et al. - 2015 - Navigo Interest forwarding by geolocations in veh.pdf},\n  note = {00122}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543452672,"version":0,"updated":1563545453626},"$loki":6194},{"itemID":5819,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_low_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Low {{Complexity Beam Searching Algorithm Using Asymptotic Property}} of {{Massive MIMO Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436659/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436659},\n  abstract = {This paper considers a low complexity codebookbased beam searching algorithm for massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems in limited scattering environments.

Hence, to deal with random access channel (RACH) overload and to better control the access in LTE-A Networks, the 3GPP proposed the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor concept. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve this method based on adaptive multiple ACB factors, according to M2M traffic category with respect to their access delay budget and drop rate (QoS parameters). Simulations were done for testing the effectiveness of our MACB scheme and show that using multiples ACB factors and dynamically adjusting them to the congestion level in addition to traffic type category increases the access probability and reduces overload. The obtained results were then compared to the basic ACB method and show that the access probability increases especially for high priority traffic.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016-01},\n  pages = {693-698},\n  author = {Zangar, Nawel and Gharbi, Sami and Abdennebi, Marwen},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/QPWEPI5R/Zangar et al_2016_Service differentiation strategy based on MACB factor for M2M Communications in.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543453438,"version":0,"updated":1563545453134},"$loki":6204},{"itemID":4405,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{jiang_joint_2018,\n  title = {A {{Joint Multi}}-{{Criteria Utility}}-{{Based Network Selection Approach}} for {{Vehicle}}-to-{{Infrastructure Networking}}},\n  volume = {19},\n  issn = {1524-9050, 1558-0016},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8248667/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TITS.2017.2778939},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

The IoT gateways play an important role in the IoT applications to bridge between sensor networks and the external environment through the Internet. Typically, the IoT gateways collect and send the data collected from sensors and actuators to external platforms where they will be remotely analyzed. However, the users desire a more adapted IoT gateway that can improve the IoT data privacy preservation before sending them to these external platforms. Thus, an IoT gateway that enables a better control over the set of private IoT resources and protects the collected personal data and their privacy is required. For this purpose, we propose a Semantic IoT Gateway that helps implement a dynamic and flexible privacy-preserving solution for the IoT domain. First, it enables to match between the data consumer's terms of service and the data owner's privacy preferences by generating an adapted privacy policy. Second, it converts the privacy policy into a custom smart contract. Finally, it connects a set of private IoT resources to a distributed network using the blockchain technology to host the generated smart contracts. A smart contract is an executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. Our proposal, which is highlighted through an example and experimentation on a real-world use-case, has given the expected results.},\n  booktitle = {On the {{Move}} to {{Meaningful Internet Systems}}. {{OTM}} 2018 {{Conferences}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {207-225},\n  author = {Loukil, Faiza and Ghedira-Guegan, Chirine and Boukadi, Khouloud and Benharkat, A\\\"icha Nabila},\n  editor = {Panetto, Herv\\'e and Debruyne, Christophe and Proper, Henderik A. and Ardagna, Claudio Agostino and Roman, Dumitru and Meersman, Robert},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W3ZCMLKK/Loukil et al. - 2018 - Semantic IoT Gateway Towards Automated Generation.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543453510,"version":0,"updated":1563545453614},"$loki":6206},{"itemID":4833,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{tang_novel_2018,\n  title = {*{{On}} a {{Novel Deep}}-{{Learning}}-{{Based Intelligent Partially Overlapping Channel Assignment}} in {{SDN}}-{{IoT}}},\n  volume = {56},\n  issn = {0163-6804, 1558-1896},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8466360/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MCOM.2018.1701227},\n  number = {9},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Magazine},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion. One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances. Thus, we proposed, in this paper, a new method to estimate accurately the number of random access attempts in a way to measure efficiently the congestion level.

Duty cycle mechanism could preserve the node's energy by providing active and sleep period. However, the uncontrolled duty cycle may affect the delivery rate due to its inconsistency of relay participation in multi-hop packet forwarding. We have observed the effect of duty cycle mechanism to deliver data with a broadcast flooding; which we know that flooding is a fundamental network service for disseminating data. From our observation, controlling a contention window size based on node's density takes an important part in reducing packet collision that leads to a good packet delivery rate. However, in a congested traffic, controlling contention window size based on node's density is not enough because the incoming packet may be congested in packet buffer which is resulting to a packet dropping. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid-based packet forwarding to increase the reliability of transmission by controlling the number of contention window size based on the node's density and packet buffer information. To preserve the energy of the nodes, we also implemented the probability-based broadcast to suppress the number of unnecessary traffic. We compared our work with broadcast flooding, adaptive contention window size, and distance-based broadcast. From our experiment, Hybridbased packet forwarding achieved the best performance in packet reception rate and can control the unnecessary traffic better than others.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {432-435},\n  author = {Virdaus, Irvanda Kurniadi and Kang, Moonsoo and Lee, Chung Ghiu},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HTMKBXA2/Virdaus et al. - 2018 - Performance Analysis of Hybrid-Based Packet Forwar.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543453794,"version":0,"updated":1563545454820},"$loki":6211},{"itemID":4583,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{grassi_vanet_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Toronto, ON, Canada}},\n  title = {{{VANET}} via {{Named Data Networking}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-3088-3},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6849267/},\n  doi = {10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849267},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE INFOCOM}} 2014 - {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications Workshops}} ({{INFOCOM WKSHPS}})},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications Workshops}} ({{INFOCOM WKSHPS}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-30},\n  date = {2014-04},\n  pages = {410-415},\n  author = {Grassi, Giulio and Pesavento, Davide and Pau, Giovanni and Vuyyuru, Rama and Wakikawa, Ryuji and Zhang, Lixia},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/KPHDN3J5/Grassi et al. - 2014 - VANET via Named Data Networking.pdf},\n  note = {00208}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543454000,"version":0,"updated":1563545453624},"$loki":6212},{"itemID":4762,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{gherairi_adaptive_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Hammamet, Tunisia}},\n  title = {Adaptive {{TDMA}}-Based Clustering for Critical Event Detection in {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-3764-6 978-1-4799-3762-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6840912},\n  doi = {10.1109/ComNet.2014.6840912},\n  abstract = {In this paper, a novel adaptive TDMA-based clustering for critical event detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is proposed.

The lower bound for average system PSP is derived when many contending EDs are transmitting by stochastic geometry. And it is shown that the average system PSP can be maximized by properly allocating an SF to each traffic, which also maximizes connectivity of EDs. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the average system PSP to propose a sub-optimal SF allocation scheme to each traffic. Analysis on PSP is validated through simulations, and comparison with existing schemes reveals that our proposed scheme achieves the highest PSP and so the maximum connectivity.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Letters},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

Several work have explored sensor validation, mostly for the purpose of automatic fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD). However, recent studies show BAS vulnerable to adversarial attacks - an area that has lacked consideration in the early design of BAS. In this work, we propose a sensor correction model, based on deep learning framework, for mitigating against data integrity attacks in BAS.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive software-defined (SD) ONU energy-saving mechanism. We propose to enhance the standard PON devices with advanced SDN capabilities so that an SD-controller can practice its global network knowledge to orchestrate an independent energy-saving mechanism for ONU's receiver (Rx) and transmitter (Tx) via the assignment of Rx sleeping duration and Tx wake-up threshold, respectively. In low traffic condition, the proposed mechanism can reduce the ONU's transmitter active time up to 98\\% while still guaranteeing the QoS requirements.

First, we take the image of LED array and segment the LED image by using LED detection algorithm. After segmenting the LED image, the LED image is resized in 10 by 10 dimension that means 100 pixels. Each pixel is the input to the BNN model for each RGB color channel. For studying the behavior of each color LED image in low (565 lux) and strong (2450 lux) environmental light intensity, we train our BNN model for low and strong environmental light intensity. Finally, we compare the performance of our BNN model with the regression analysis model at low and strong environmental light intensity.

This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the offered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of e ciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for different multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of different parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study. In the first part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user's preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario. We also improve the latter solution by proposing a network selection algorithm that provides a load balancing technique based on matching game theory to overcome network overload conditions in high-speed scenarios. In the second part, the performance study has been evaluated for two scenario types: Cellular and Vehicular. The proposed algorithms were evaluated and validated in both mobile and vehicular environments using the NS3 simulator.},\n  institution = {{Universit\\'e Mohammed V - Rabat}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2017-10-21},\n  keywords = {Game},\n  author = {Drissi, M.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ZI97W7CU/Drissi_2017_A Multi Criteria Real Time Network Selection Framework in Heterogeneous.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543457594,"version":0,"updated":1563545453180},"$loki":6252},{"itemID":3988,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{min_approach_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An {{Approach}} to {{Resource}} and {{QoS}}-{{Aware Services Optimal Composition}} in the {{Big Service}} and {{Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  volume = {6},\n  issn = {2169-3536},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8410873/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2855807},\n  abstract = {Recently, various types of services belonging to different domains intertwine together and constitute the Big Service. In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users' complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufficient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great influences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper first defines the SFSD and describes the important influences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  urldate = {2019-04-27},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {39895-39906},\n  author = {Min, Xunyou and Xu, Xiaofei and Liu, Zhizhong and Chu, Dianhui and Wang, Zhongjie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/I8KMID9I/Min et al. - 2018 - An Approach to Resource and QoS-Aware Services Opt.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543457620,"version":0,"updated":1563545453274},"$loki":6253},{"itemID":4765,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{wannachai_adaptive_2015,\n  location = {{Singapore}},\n  title = {Adaptive {{Transmission Range Based}} on {{Event Detection}} for {{WSNs}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8055-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7106944/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ISSNIP.2015.7106944},\n  eventtitle = {2015 {{IEEE Tenth International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Sensors}}, {{Sensor Networks}} and {{Information Processing}} ({{ISSNIP}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE Tenth International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Sensors}}, {{Sensor Networks}} and {{Information Processing}} ({{ISSNIP}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2015-04},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  keywords = {Range},\n  author = {Wannachai, Autanan and Champrasert, Paskorn},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/59QLME7G/Wannachai_Champrasert_2015_Adaptive Transmission Range Based on Event Detection for WSNs.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543457642,"version":0,"updated":1563545453744},"$loki":6254},{"itemID":5606,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{katsumata_i2v_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{I2V Multi}}-{{Hop Broadcast Communication}} by {{TC}}-{{BF Method}}},\n  abstract = {A novel Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) multi-hop broadcast communication technique is proposed.

A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion.

A framework called the SPontaneous Information and Resource sharing InfrasTructure (SPIRIT) has been presented before to address the challenges of proximity-aware mobile sensor sharing. SPIRIT allows mobile applications to share sensors as services in an automatic fashion by enabling the service providers and clients to express a variety of QoS specifications. This paper presents a set of mobility-aware QoS mechanisms for enabling the implementation of QoS specifications along the multihop paths between service providers and clients in highly mobile environments. Simulations in small-scale Mobile Ad Hoc Networks show SPIRIT's ability to effectively control and manage traffic flows while maintaining desired QoS.

Existing schemes for iBGP routing include the full-mesh (FM) solution, route reflection (RR) solution and confederation. Optimal prefix routing and route diversity are the main strength of the FM solution. However, it is rarely employed in a large networks due to its poor scalability. The RR scheme solves the scalability challenge at the cost of FM optimality due to Route Reflector's partial view of the network. The concept of Software Defined Networking (SDN) entails decoupling of the control plane from the forwarding plane such that the control plane is logically centralized benefiting from an overall knowledge of the network for decision making. In this work, we propose a solution based on multicasting which employs relay nodes in the iBGP message dissemination. The relay nodes are elected and act as boundaries of multicast groups, relaying and filtering prefixes into other multicast groups. We evaluate the use of single and multiple relay nodes per multicast group. Our solution brings session management scalability and minimization of duplicate prefix announcement through elimination of peer sessions deemed unnecessary.

The proposed fuzzy logic controller accepts the input descriptors in routing metrics to optimize the network performance. The proposed algorithm adopts energy-efficient possibilistic routing by using fuzzy inference rules to merge energy aware metrics for choosing the optimal delivery path.

In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats).

In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches.

However, the number of the services that can be supplied through these devices on the Internet will increase more and more. In this context, performing the composition and selection of the best services according to quality-of-service (QoS) criteria become a complex task, especially when dealing with global service selection to satisfy global constraints of users in decentralized environments.

A proactive cache technology, which allocates cache data to MEC servers accessed by mobile terminals in advance, is one of technologies to provide the data in a low latency for the mobile terminals. The technology, however, less considers both of the cache placement in time for handover (HO) of mobile terminals and the increase in the traffic between MEC servers for cache distribution. The increase in the traffic is caused by duplicated routes of cache transfer from a location of content data to cache locations and by cache placements on more MEC servers to improve cache hit rate according to a mobile terminal transition. In this paper, we propose a novel proactive cache system which transfers cache data in time for HO of mobile terminals and reduces the traffic between MEC servers, using a route de-duplicating technique for cache transfer and selective data delivery utilizing the locations of mobile terminals predicted from cellular-radio information. We also propose the system architecture which enables services to utilize cellular-radio information by APIs, and evaluate the system by a simulation of the HO prediction and the estimation of the traffic between MEC servers for transferring caches.

Since radar technology is continuously evolving and diversifying, however, the library based method can not properly classify the signals for new threats which are not in the existing libraries, thus limiting the choice of appropriate jamming techniques. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the signals so that the optimal jamming technique can be selected by using only the parameter data of the radar signal.

While this ``low power listening'' approach is simple, asynchronous, and energy-efficient, the long preamble introduces excess latency at each hop, is suboptimal in terms of energy consumption, and suffers from excess energy consumption at nontarget receivers. X-MAC proposes solutions to each of these problems by employing a shortened preamble approach that retains the advantages of low power listening, namely low power communication, simplicity and a decoupling of transmitter and receiver sleep schedules. We demonstrate through implementation and evaluation in a wireless sensor testbed that X-MAC's shortened preamble approach significantly reduces energy usage at both the transmitter and receiver, reduces per-hop latency, and offers additional advantages such as flexible adaptation to both bursty and periodic sensor data sources.},\n  pages = {14},\n  author = {Buettner, Michael and Yee, Gary V and Anderson, Eric and Han, Richard},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/8AZQMW8U/Buettner et al. - X-MAC A Short PreambSleenMsAoCr NPertowtoocrkosl .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543463140,"version":0,"updated":1563545454200},"$loki":6307},{"itemID":4054,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{rafikzitouni_tpsdr_,\n  title = {{{TP}}-{{SDR}}.Pdf},\n  author = {{Rafik Zitouni}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/5K8KILEY/TP-SDR.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543463328,"version":0,"updated":1563545453328},"$loki":6308},{"itemID":5569,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kim_bidirectional_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Bidirectional {{Equalization}} for {{Long}}-{{Range Underwater Acoustic Communication}} in {{BLAC18}}},\n  abstract = {The bidirectional equalization is an effective method for demodulating communication signals with weak strength since it improves the signal-to-noise ratio by obtaining additional diversity as well as temporal and spatial diversity when used in combination with the time reversal technique.

In this work, we present an enhanced LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN MAC protocol is characterized by the restrictive use of the channel, limited by the regulatory authorities to a 1\\% duty cycle per cycle (i.e., 36 s per hour) per node. This regulation penalizes the nodes which require a channel access time greater than the limited duty cycle to occasionally transmit a large amount of data such as video surveillance or access control information in applications like smart school surveillance. However, some other nodes like environment sensors sharing a same LoRaWAN server may send very small amounts of information (e.g. temperature, humidity, ...) and under-use the authorized activity time of 1\\% duty cycle. Hence the idea of implementing an activity time sharing mechanism among nodes that allows devices to borrow additional activity time from a device or set of devices that have completed the transmission of their packets and do not need the remaining time of the corresponding duty cycle. Our work extends and improves the activity time sharing mechanism initially proposed in [1]. Instead of FIFO sharing-time allocation based on a global activity time, which may lead to the starvation of the nodes that are others than that in the head of FIFO line, we propose a new time allocation algorithm based on the classification of the different requests according to their needs in terms of their QoS requirements. It allows to satisfy a larger number of nodes requiring extra time, with less control overheads while ensuring fairness. Our time-sharing algorithm has been implemented and tested on the wasp-mote chip of libelium, showing the performance improvement and its practical usability.},\n  booktitle = {Ad-Hoc, {{Mobile}}, and {{Wireless Networks}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {147-162},\n  author = {Benkahla, Norhane and Tounsi, Hajer and Song, Ye-Qiong and Frikha, Mounir},\n  editor = {Montavont, Nicolas and Papadopoulos, Georgios Z.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/YN2LAJUR/Benkahla et al. - 2018 - Enhanced Dynamic Duty Cycle in LoRaWAN Network.pdf},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-00247-3_15},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543463918,"version":0,"updated":1563545455260},"$loki":6319},{"itemID":4457,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_lowpower_,\n  title = {Low-Power, {{Long}}-Range {{WAN}} for {{IoT}}: A Technology Overview},\n  url = {http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/Paper/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3BE7JT5S/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543465294,"version":0,"updated":1563545453544},"$loki":6320},{"itemID":5584,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{park_structure_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Structure {{Design}} for {{Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management System}}},\n  abstract = {The application of the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) in various fields has been attracting attention, and the development of a service utilizing UAS has been proceeding.

In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a network selection scheme, which is for users that select an optimal network with best comprehensive performance between different types of networks. However, the optimal network may be not the most reasonable one due to compensation of MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making), and the network is called pseudo-optimal network. This paper conducts a performance evaluation of a number of widely used MADM-based methods for network selection that aim to keep the mobile users always best connected anywhere and anytime, where subjective weight and objective weight are all considered. The performance analysis shows that the selection scheme based on MEW (weighted multiplicative method) and combination weight can better avoid accessing pseudo-optimal network for balancing network load and reducing ping-pong effect in comparison with three other MADM solutions.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  author = {Zhou, Jian and Zhu, Can-yan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/INK55447/Zhou_Zhu_2016_Compensatory Analysis and Optimization for MADM for Heterogeneous Wireless.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543465586,"version":0,"updated":1563545453504},"$loki":6326},{"itemID":5625,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{choi_impact_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Impact of {{Imperfect Spectrum Sensing}} on {{Hybrid Backscatter Assisted Cognitive Wireless Powered Radio Networks}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a proper sensing period when the detection probability of determining the state of the primary user (PU) changes in a hybrid harvest-then-transmit (HTT) system according to the sensing period.

As a result, image quality assessment (IQA) methods designed for natural images are not always suitable for screen content images. However, as time goes, many screen contents are being generated which share several properties of natural images. As a result, IQA methods for SCI need to be more generic while giving priority to the prominent SCI features. The image gradient is a very important feature for all kinds of images, especially for SCI. In this paper, we proposed a novel image gradient based similarity index (CGSI) for screen content images where the gradient is used both as a quality map and extractor for another feature map. Our previous studies show that the center part of an image is visually the most important part and HVS is more sensitive to any distortion in the middle area. To address this issue, the center area of both gradient and feature similarity maps are raised by element-wise squaring. Eventually, the final quality score is calculated using a summation of standard deviation based pooling strategy. We evaluated our proposed method on three large scale SCI databases and compared with 8 other state-of-the-art IQA methods designed for both natural and screen content images. Results show that the proposed approach provides competitive performance and defeats all other methods with a large gap in overall performance.

The present solutions include vision-based tracking in order to decouple the dynamics, which needs additional hardware. In this paper, a decoupling controller is presented that employs an accelerometer-based force feedback system for measuring the undesired forces in off-axis which does not need any additional hardware. The simulation results indicate that the force feedback methodology is very effective in controlling the off-axis drift of the coaxial helicopter.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {53-58},\n  author = {Balakrishnan, Brijith and {Shamrao} and Aditya, R and Narendra Nath, S and Narayana, Sujay and Prasad, R.

Even the simplest objects will become ``smart'' because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  urldate = {2019-02-14},\n  date = {2017-03-01},\n  pages = {74-84},\n  author = {Aloi, G. and Caliciuri, G. and Fortino, G. and Gravina, R. and Pace, P. and Russo, W. and Savaglio, C.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/L6P8YIFR/Aloi et al_2017_Enabling IoT interoperability through opportunistic smartphone-based mobile.pdf},\n  note = {00106}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543466352,"version":0,"updated":1563545453066},"$loki":6336},{"itemID":5572,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{yamazaki_spectrum_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Spectrum {{Sharing Exploiting Spectrum Database}} for {{LPWA}}},\n  abstract = {In the most of current low power wide area (LPWA), packet collisions of uplink communication are controlled by setting duty cycle (DC), which controls the transmission cycle not to exceed the predefined fixed threshold. However, as the number of LPWA nodes increases, the fixed DC fatally increases the number of packet collisions and degrades the communication quality. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adaptive DC decision algorithm. The proposed algorithm aims at adapting the period that the system interferes with others and reducing the packet loss rate of uplink communication of the whole system to below the required value by adapting DC with the help of measurement-based spectrum database (MSD). In the proposed method, MSD knows the number of LoRa nodes that interfere with the nodes of other systems. The DC is calculated for keeping the period of interference to less than a certain duration. In addition, the DC is also adapted based on the required packet loss rate to improve communication efficiency. Computer simulation results show that the allowable interference time ratio and the required packet loss rate can be accurately guaranteed compared to the conventional method with the fixed DC even if the number of nodes increases.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Yamazaki, Yudai and Fujii, Takeo and Takyu, Osamu and Ohta, Mai and Adachi, Koichi},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HZA239DP/Yamazaki et al. - Spectrum Sharing Exploiting Spectrum Database for .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543466392,"version":0,"updated":1563545454356},"$loki":6337},{"itemID":5610,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kim_enhanced_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Enhanced {{Model}}-{{Free Deep}}-{{Q Network}} Based {{PTZ Camera Control Method}}},\n  abstract = {Recently, the algorithm based on reinforcement learning for controlling PTZ(Pan/Tilt/Zoom) of a camera has been significantly increasing.

That is quite different from other existing proposals, as it deals with real maps and actual streets, as well as several road traffic distributions. We propose an evolutionary algorithm (later efficiently parallelized) to optimize our case studies which have been imported from OpenStreetMap into SUMO as they belong to a real city. We have also developed a Rerouting Algorithm which accesses the configuration of the Red Swarm and communicates the route chosen to vehicles, using the spots (via WiFi link). Moreover, we have developed three competing algorithms in order to compare their results to those of Red Swarm and have observed that Red Swarm not only achieved the best results, but also outperformed the experts' solutions in a total of 60 scenarios tested, with up to 19\\% shorter travel times.},\n  journaltitle = {Applied Soft Computing},\n  shortjournal = {Appl.

As a multi-hop wireless network, U-Bus Air gathers meter reading information connected to a monitoring center. The terminal with the function of connecting to a monitoring center is called a gateway (GW). The multi-hop function is used to connect GWs; this reduces the cost of connecting wide-area wireless networks. However, the order of installing a new terminal is random because it is determined by timing of replacement on meter in individual homes on meters in individual homes. As a result, the installing location of GWs cannot be specified in advance. Consequently, any created network topology will exhibit redundancies, such as unnecessary GWs, or generate many small networks. In this paper, we propose two different redundancy reducing methods that use information of terminals on cloud to reconstruct a network topology. The proposed methods consists of three steps: gathering information, emulating the topology to reduce redundancy using cloud, and providing feedback to rebuild information of each smart meter. We perform a computer simulation to evaluate the packet delivery ratio (PDR) and the reduction ratio of the number of GWs. We confirm that the redundancy can be reduced by using the proposed methods without affecting the performance of the network topology.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {223-228},\n  author = {Sanada, Hiroshi and Fujii, Takeo and Aizawa, Reina and Kawata, Takuya},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/P8Y5RV88/Sanada et al. - 2018 - Routing Redundancy Reducing Method for U-Bus Air U.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543467238,"version":0,"updated":1563545454722},"$loki":6351},{"itemID":4755,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_live_,\n  title = {Live {{Objects}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MXBJMHZZ/Presentation Live-Objects.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543468482,"version":0,"updated":1563545453734},"$loki":6352},{"itemID":5556,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{atoev_secure_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {The {{Secure UAV Communication Link Based}} on {{OTP Encryption Technique}}},\n  abstract = {The demand on the security and reliability of the communication and data link of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is much higher since the environment of the modern battlefield is becoming more and more complex.

Even when the gates used to perform these operations are noisy, the quantum computation must be tolerable to the errors.

In addition, we analyze the IoT success factors of these LPWAN technologies, and we consider application scenarios and explain which technology is the best fit for each of these scenarios.},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {ICT Express},\n  shortjournal = {ICT Express},\n  urldate = {2019-04-30},\n  date = {2019-03-01},\n  pages = {1-7},\n  author = {Mekki, Kais and Bajic, Eddy and Chaxel, Frederic and Meyer, Fernand},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/QRL8S75M/Mekki et al_2019_A comparative study of LPWAN technologies for large-scale IoT deployment.pdf},\n  note = {00078}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543469098,"version":0,"updated":1563545453300},"$loki":6361},{"itemID":5595,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{chen_koi_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Koi {{Fish Warehousing Based}} on {{Mobile Cloud Computing}}},\n  abstract = {We propose an application paradigm of mobile cloud computing with big video data for ornamental fish warehousing (OFWare) system dedicated to koi fishes.

Therefore, rather than using invasive RFID-based systems, we combine mobile cloud computing and big data analytics techniques including image and video collecting and transmission by handheld mobile devices, unsupervised texture pattern classification in fish tank videos, image retrieval based on support vector machine, and statistical analysis for the warehouse management.

To alleviate such congestion while regulating the M2M devices' opportunities to transmit, the Access Class Barring (ACB) process was proposed. In this article, we propose a novel implementation of the ACB mechanism in the context of multiple M2M traffic classes. Based on a scheduling algorithm, we have applied a PID controller to adjust dynamically multiple ACB factors related to each class category, guaranteeing a number of devices around an optimal value that maximizes the Random Access (RA) success probability. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism by increasing the success probability and minimizing radio resources' underutilization with respect to each class priority.},\n  eventtitle = {The 18th {{ACM International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 18th {{ACM International Conference}} on {{Modeling}}, {{Analysis}} and {{Simulation}} of {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Systems}} - {{MSWiM}} '15},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2015},\n  pages = {195-199},\n  author = {Bouzouita, Meriam and Hadjadj-Aoul, Yassine and Zangar, Nawel and Rubino, Gerardo and Tabbane, Sami},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/A6J9RJCE/Bouzouita et al_2015_Multiple Access Class Barring Factors Algorithm for M2M Communications in.pdf},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543469348,"version":0,"updated":1563545453126},"$loki":6365},{"itemID":3806,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bari_automated_2007,\n  title = {Automated Network Selection in a Heterogeneous Wireless Network Environment},\n  volume = {21},\n  issn = {0890-8044},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4107918/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MNET.2007.314536},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Network},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Netw.},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2007-01},\n  pages = {34-40},\n  author = {Bari, Farooq and Leung, Victor},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SM8ZITCD/Bari_Leung_2007_Automated network selection in a heterogeneous wireless network environment.pdf},\n  note = {00282}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543469362,"version":0,"updated":1563545453182},"$loki":6366},{"itemID":5873,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{yoon_implementation_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Implementation of {{Private Base Station}} in {{Android Container Environment}} for {{Mobile Communication}}},\n  abstract = {Recent research discovered a noticeable number of intelligent malicious apps that could use various techniques to avoid analysis and detection.

In this paper, we model a LoRa network consisting of nodes with different communication settings in terms of bandwidth and spreading factor. We compute the average success probability per configuration as a function of density taking into account both intra and inter-spreading factor collisions. We, also, formulate and solve an optimization problem to maximize the node capacity for a given deployment area and frequency by optimizing the number of nodes having different spreading factor configurations. We present numerical results and we show that solutions close to the optimal can increase the maximum number of nodes by more than 700\\% compared to case where equal number of users per spreading factor are considered.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-20},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {516-520},\n  author = {Zorbas, Dimitrios and Papadopoulos, Georgios Z. and Maille, Patrick and Montavont, Nicolas and Douligeris, Christos},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/URAPMILT/Zorbas et al. - 2018 - Improving LoRa Network Capacity Using Multiple Spr.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543469602,"version":0,"updated":1563545453812},"$loki":6369},{"itemID":4957,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{sutton_zippy_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Seoul, South Korea}},\n  title = {Zippy: {{On}}-{{Demand Network Flooding}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-3631-4},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2809695.2809705},\n  doi = {10.1145/2809695.2809705},\n  shorttitle = {Zippy},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the challenge of rapidly disseminating rare events through a multi-hop network, while achieving unprecedented energy-efficiency.

As a consequence, data breaches are expected to increase in gravity and occurrence. To counteract unintended data disclosure, a great deal of effort has been dedicated in devising methods for uncovering privacy leaks. Existing solutions, however, have not addressed the time- and data-intensive nature of leak detection. The shift from hardware-specific implementation to software-based solutions is the core idea behind the concept of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). On the other hand, the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm is characterized by the decoupling of the forwarding and control planes. In this paper, an SDN/NFV-enabled architecture is proposed for improving the efficiency of leak detection systems. Employing a previously developed identification strategy, Personally Identifiable Information detector (PIID) and load balancer VNFs are packaged and deployed in OpenStack through an NFV MANO. Meanwhile, SDN controllers permit the load balancer to dynamically redistribute traffic among the PIID instances. In a physical testbed, tests are conducted to evaluate the proposed architecture. Experimental results indicate that the proportions of forwarding and parsing on total overhead is influenced by the traffic intensity. Furthermore, an NFV-enabled system with scalability features was found to outperform a nonvirtualized implementation in terms of latency (85.1\\%), packet loss (98.3\\%) and throughput (8.41\\%).},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Go, Sharleen Joy Y and Guinto, Richard and Festin, Cedric Angelo M and Austria, Isabel and Ocampo, Roel and Tan, Wilson M},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/LUKRACEH/Go et al. - An SDNNFV-Enabled Architecture for Detecting Pers.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543469642,"version":0,"updated":1563545454488},"$loki":6371},{"itemID":4742,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pujolle_cell_2019l,\n  title = {{{CELL TD}}-{{Cell}}-{{GP}}},\n  date = {2019},\n  author = {Pujolle},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ERU394NI/TD-Cell-GP.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543469826,"version":0,"updated":1563545453710},"$loki":6372},{"itemID":5579,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{lee_ambient_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Ambient {{Environment Recognition Algorithm Fusing Vision}} and {{LiDAR Sensors}} for {{Robust Multi}}-Channel {{V2X System}}},\n  abstract = {Recently, 5G commercialization issues and standardization of WAVE communication have been done on V2X communication of autonomous vehicles.

The delivery ratio and communication delay were measured under varying network density, node mobility and traffic load conditions. The obtained results show that TBR does outperform VBF (twice or more better) in terms of these measures. It was also observed from the simulation results that TBR performs better under low node mobility conditions.

Unfortunately, GPS data is still plagued with errors that frequently produce inaccurate trajectories. Research in map matching algorithms focuses on how to efficiently match GPS tracking data to the underlying road network. This article presents an innovative map matching algorithm that considers the trajectory of the data rather than merely the current position as in the typical map matching case. Instead of computing the precise angle which is traditionally used, a discrete eightdirection chain code, to represent a trend of movement, is used. Coupled with distance information, map matching decisions are made by comparing the differences between trajectories representing the road segments and GPS tracking data chain-codes. Moreover, to contrast the performance of the chain-code algorithm, two evaluation strategies, linear and non-linear, are analyzed. The presented chain-code map matching algorithm was evaluated for wheelchair navigation using university campus sidewalk data. The evaluation results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in terms of accuracy and computational time.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Transactions in GIS},\n  shortjournal = {Trans.

Many community detection methods are derived from specific backgrounds and their reliability is still questionable. Researchers hardly focus on the general definition of communities and the general community detection algorithms. The discrepancy between the two might pose some obstacles to the optimization of them so that it is hard to use one algorithm to perfect the other. Recently, Lu et al. [1] have proposed a general method for constructing network model from the real-world problem. Also, they have given a general definition of community structure as well as a complete procedure for detecting communities. In this paper, we apply the efficient resistance distance function [2] on Lu et al.'s algorithm and compare its performance with other community detection algorithms that allow for overlaps.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {448-453},\n  author = {Behera, Soom and Lu, Haoye and Nayak, Amiya},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TNPZYDBQ/Behera et al. - 2018 - Performance Evaluation of Community Detection Algo.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543472368,"version":0,"updated":1563545454828},"$loki":6395},{"itemID":3490,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{febbraro_using_2009,\n  title = {On Using Petri Nets for Representing and Controlling Signalized Urban Areas: {{New}} Model and Results},\n  doi = {10.1109/ITSC.2009.5309701},\n  shorttitle = {On Using Petri Nets for Representing and Controlling Signalized Urban Areas},\n  abstract = {A microscopic model of signalized urban areas and its representation by means of stochastic-timed Petri nets are described in this paper, where a traffic-responsive control strategy, whose objective is the optimization of green duration of each stage, is also proposed.

The current spectrum access process of legacy WLANs uses clear channel assessment (CCA) and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), where the spectrum is sensed before use and a random binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanism is employed for collision avoidance. While LAA uses a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism, moderately similar to the CCA CSMA/CA for channel access. However, there is a fairness issue when these two technologies coexist. In this paper, we propose a channel observation-based LBT (CoLBT) mechanism for fairness in LAAWi-Fi coexistence scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a more realistic practical channel observation-based collision probability observed by the LAA evolved Node B (eNB) to adaptively scale-up and scale-down the backoff contention window for channel contention, to reduce the waste of resources and improve LAAWiFi coexistence performance. Simulation results validate that the proposed CoLBT mechanism is effective in LAA-WiFi coexistence scenario and can improve fairness performance, compared with the current mechanism of LBT.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {154-158},\n  author = {Ali, Rashid and Shahin, Nurullah and Musaddiq, Arslan and Kim, Byung-Seo and Kim, Sung Won},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/CSIL7EYB/Ali et al. - 2018 - Fair and Efficient Channel Observation-Based Liste.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543472634,"version":0,"updated":1563545454686},"$loki":6398},{"itemID":5823,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{han_achievable_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Achievable {{Rate Evaluation}} by {{System Level Simulation}} for Mm {{Wave Based Backhaul Network Adopting}} In-{{Band Full}}-{{Duplex}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436798/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436798},\n  abstract = {The millimetre-wave(mmWave) based wireless backhaul operating in an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) mode is evaluated by system level simulation.

More specifically, this paper focuses on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This paper presents a detailed model of CSS, showing that the symbols are not perfectly orthogonal. The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufficient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2016-11},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  keywords = {SF},\n  author = {Reynders, Brecht and Pollin, Sofie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WMB5B87Q/Reynders and Pollin - 2016 - Chirp spread spectrum as a modulation technique fo.pdf},\n  note = {00051}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543472874,"version":0,"updated":1563545453402},"$loki":6400},{"itemID":4400,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{hejazi_survey_2018,\n  location = {{Eger}},\n  title = {Survey of Platforms for Massive {{IoT}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-1208-8},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8325598/},\n  doi = {10.1109/FIOT.2018.8325598},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Future IoT Technologies}} ({{Future IoT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Future IoT Technologies}} ({{Future IoT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-16},\n  date = {2018-01},\n  pages = {1-8},\n  author = {Hejazi, Hamdan and Rajab, Husam and Cinkler, Tibor and Lengyel, Laszlo},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/H6UDRLX6/Hejazi et al_2018_Survey of platforms for massive IoT.pdf},\n  note = {00009}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543472894,"version":0,"updated":1563545453498},"$loki":6401},{"itemID":4858,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{xunhu_joint_2015,\n  location = {{Shanghai, China}},\n  title = {A Joint Utility Optimization Based Virtual {{AP}} and Network Slice Selection Scheme for {{SDWNs}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8795-5},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7497982/},\n  doi = {10.1109/CHINACOM.2015.7497982},\n  eventtitle = {2015 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Communications}} and {{Networking}} in {{China}} ({{ChinaCom}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Communications}} and {{Networking}} in {{China}} ({{ChinaCom}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-20},\n  date = {2015-08},\n  pages = {448-453},\n  author = {{Xun Hu} and {Rong Chai} and {Guixiang Jiang} and {Haipeng Li}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/BUKIVYPV/Xun Hu et al_2015_A joint utility optimization based virtual AP and network slice selection.pdf},\n  note = {00004}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543472912,"version":0,"updated":1563545453814},"$loki":6402},{"itemID":5849,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{song_angleofarrival_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Angle-of-{{Arrival Estimation}} in {{Antenna Arrays}} Based on {{Monopulse Signal}}},\n  abstract = {Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) estimation supports beamforming that controls array beams in a desired direction while eliminating interference signals.

The difference between it and the existing congestion control algorithm is that it is derived from actual congestions. BBR measures the bottleneck bandwidth and round-trip propagation time sequentially and sends data based on bandwidth delay product (BDP). The mere dependence on the BDP unfairly allocates a larger part of the bandwidth to a flow with long RTT than a short RTT flow. This nature of the BBR entirely conflicts with the trend of traditional TCP where a short RTT flow is more vibrant than long RTT flow. To solve this problem, we previously proposed the bottleneck queue buildup suppression method and verified that through NS-3. However, during the testbed experiments, we found that the previous method was unstable and led to unexpected results. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an improved version of the previously proposed algorithm.

We decentralize the problem by managing the traffic of each intersection independently from others. We define control agents which are able to synchronize the multiple flows of vehicles in each intersection, by alternating vehicles from both directions.

The main standard, IEEE802.15.4e 2012, introduces a deterministic and synchronous multi-channel extension (DSME) model. Three main issues should be tackled and improved with this model; a high energy consumption of end nodes during the contention access period (CAP), a long association and guaranteed time slot (GTS) earning times during a network initialization phase and a long network discovery time. These issues have been analysed and improved in a star topology wireless sensor network (WSN). Four scenarios with different numbers of nodes are investigated. Nodes numbers are set according to network saturation ratios (25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%). This paper proposes three enhancements for the performance of this model. Two new approaches are proposed to reduce the energy consumption of end nodes during the CAP period, a new association scheme during network initialization phase using a tight TDMA algorithm to minimize the time required for association and getting a GTS slot and reduce power consumption due to collisions, and a new technique to reduce network discovery time. Simulation results show significant improvements in reducing energy consumption and radio duty cycle (RDC) of end nodes by a factor of (71) and (77) respectively. Good improvements are also achieved in reducing association and GTS earning times by a factor of (8) on average. Finally, network discovery time has been reduced for fast association and further energy saving of end nodes.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {426-431},\n  author = {Alsudany, Sameer K. and Boussakta, Said and Johnston, Martin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TBGVGQTU/Alsudany et al. - 2018 - Enhancements of IEEE802.15.4e DSME Model of Wirele.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543474896,"version":0,"updated":1563545454818},"$loki":6415},{"itemID":4358,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{sudhakar_fair_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Fair Service Matching Agent for Federated Cloud},\n  volume = {76},\n  issn = {00457906},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045790618332282},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.compeleceng.2019.03.002},\n  journaltitle = {Computers \\& Electrical Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Computers \\& Electrical Engineering},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2019-06},\n  pages = {13-23},\n  author = {Sudhakar, S. and Nithya, N.S. and Radhakrishnan, B.L.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ASLA6X8P/Sudhakar et al_2019_Fair service matching agent for federated cloud.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543475164,"version":0,"updated":1563545453456},"$loki":6416},{"itemID":4435,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{tsapardakis_performance_2018,\n  location = {{Thessaloniki, Greece}},\n  title = {Performance {{Evaluation}} of {{SDN}} and {{RPL}} in {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-7272-3},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8635599/},\n  doi = {10.1109/GIIS.2018.8635599},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Global Information Infrastructure}} and {{Networking Symposium}} ({{GIIS}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Global Information Infrastructure}} and {{Networking Symposium}} ({{GIIS}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2018-10},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  author = {Tsapardakis, Eleftherios and Ojo, Mike and Chatzimisios, Periklis and Giordano, Stefano},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/CTTNBAT9/Tsapardakis et al_2018_Performance Evaluation of SDN and RPL in Wireless Sensor Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543475226,"version":0,"updated":1563545453524},"$loki":6417},{"itemID":5081,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@thesis{mendes_controlador_2017,\n  title = {Controlador {{Cognitivo}} Para {{Estores}} e {{Luminosidade}} Baseado Em {{IoT}} e {{Base}}-de-{{Dados}} Em {{Cloud}}},\n  type = {PhD Thesis},\n  date = {2017},\n  author = {Mendes, Ant\\'onio Pedro Pontinha},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/FALPCTSF/Mendes - 2017 - Controlador Cognitivo para Estores e Luminosidade .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XWTQP6TE/34381.html},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543475250,"version":0,"updated":1563545454276},"$loki":6418},{"itemID":5641,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{caturano_automated_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Automated {{Discovery}} of {{CoAP}}-Enabled {{IoT}} Devices},\n  abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a framework that allows for the automated discovery of IoT devices.

The Crawler is itself a Web-enabled device that dynamically draws an overlay network topology in which resources are represented as nodes and inter-device relationships as edges between pairs of nodes. This approach allows for the creation of a completely distributed, non-hierarchical, Peer-to-Peer overlay network.

Interestingly, our study shows that in the high signal to noise ratio (SNR) region, the ``strong'' NOMA user is more penalized in terms of its EC under the same delay constraint as the ``weak'' user.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Nasfi, Rihem and Chorti, Arsenia},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ZNV2NQYT/Nasﬁ and Chorti - Performance Analysis of the Uplink of a Two User N.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543475846,"version":0,"updated":1563545454902},"$loki":6427},{"itemID":3250,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{pujolle_quelle_2018,\n  langid = {french},\n  title = {Quelle architecture de r\\'eseau pour les ann\\'ees 2020 ?},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {115},\n  author = {Pujolle, Guy},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/NL6PFI8E/Pujolle_Quelle architecture de réseau pour les années 2020.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543476034,"version":0,"updated":1563545452900},"$loki":6428},{"itemID":3286,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{perera_mosden_2013,\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  eprint = {1310.4038},\n  primaryClass = {cs},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{MOSDEN}}: {{An Internet}} of {{Things Middleware}} for {{Resource Constrained Mobile Devices}}},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4038},\n  shorttitle = {{{MOSDEN}}},\n  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of Future Internet and will comprise many billions of Internet Connected Objects (ICO) or `things' where things can sense, communicate, compute and potentially actuate as well as have intelligence, multi-modal interfaces, physical/ virtual identities and attributes. Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments. Our proposed middleware is built on Android platform.},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2013-10-15},\n  author = {Perera, Charith and Jayaraman, Prem Prakash and Zaslavsky, Arkady and Christen, Peter and Georgakopoulos, Dimitrios},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/L26NV8MT/Perera et al_2013_MOSDEN.pdf},\n  note = {00107}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543476066,"version":0,"updated":1563545452916},"$loki":6429},{"itemID":3426,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{fakhfakh_deep_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Deep {{Learning}}-{{Based Recommendation}}: {{Current Issues}} and {{Challenges}}},\n  volume = {8},\n  issn = {21565570, 2158107X},\n  url = {http://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=8&Issue=12&Code=ijacsa&SerialNo=9},\n  doi = {10.14569/IJACSA.2017.081209},\n  shorttitle = {Deep {{Learning}}-{{Based Recommendation}}},\n  abstract = {Due to the revolutionary advances of deep learning achieved in the field of computer vision, object recognition and natural language processing, the deep learning gained much attention.

A simple two-slope line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight outdoor path loss model is proposed and compared to different existing path loss models. The outdoor path loss is found to be approximately 5 dB higher for 3.5 GHz compared to 1.9 GHz. The outdoor-to-indoor propagation is investigated for two office buildings and different street shops. For the different presented scenarios, penetration loss increases with frequency and is found to be up to 5 dB higher for 3.5 GHz compared with 1.9 GHz.

For a node operating in the 868 MHz ISM band using 14 dBm transmit power and the maximum spreading factor, we have observed the maximum communication range of over 15 km on ground and close to 30 km on water.

In our previous research we have devised an Information Flow security model that gives the vertices and edges numerical attributes, based on their user credibility and connection strength, such as age of user account and the friendship duration of two users, from which we have assessed the level of information sharing willingness of an ego node to users that are not directly connected to it, thus categorizing them as adversaries or acquaintances. In this research we use this model to generate a trustworthy network of users by creating a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph instance and iterating the removal of the weak-attributed edges and their connected vertices. We use a known MST algorithm (Kruskal's algorithm) on this unique graph, thus achieving a good Trust threshold of a user network that allows a safe information flow in the OSN.

One of the major efforts to meet it is the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP(DASH) standard. However, its performance heavily depends on the client's adaptive quality selection algorithm that is not included in the standard. The existing conventional algorithms are basically based on a procedural algorithm that is not easy to capture and reflect all variations of dynamic network and traffic conditions in real network environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel quality selection mechanism based on the Deep Q-Network(DQN) model, the DQN-based DASH ABR(\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend{} ) mechanism. The proposed mechanism adopts a new reward calculation method based on five major performance metrics to reflect the current conditions of networks and devices in real time. The \\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend{} system is implemented as a separate server that is connected via a high-speed LAN to the simulation host where the ns-3 DASH simulation software is performed. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism quickly selects a suitable quality even in high error rate environments, significantly reducing the frequency of quality change compared to the existing algorithm and improving the average quality during video playback.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {561-566},\n  author = {Kim, Iseul and Hong, Seongjun and Jung, Sungwook and Lim, Kyungshik},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/JGK3L8Z8/Kim et al. - 2018 - A Quality Selection Mechanism Using a Deep Q-Netwo.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543479568,"version":0,"updated":1563545454882},"$loki":6463},{"itemID":3448,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{jeon_rmbc_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Chiang Mai, Thailand}},\n  title = {{{RMBC}}: {{Randomized}} Mesh Blockchain Using {{DBFT}} Consensus Algorithm},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-2290-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8343211/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICOIN.2018.8343211},\n  shorttitle = {{{RMBC}}},\n  abstract = {The blockchain is decentralized network system that verifies the validity of the transaction through the consensus of the verifiers without trusted third parties.

However, there are some problems with the growth of the blockchain. The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction. This has the disadvantage that the system doesn't operate without compensation. Also, the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Algorithm using private blockchain has a limited number of acceptable malicious users.

The only complexity increase with respect to LS estimator lies in fitting the parameters of a deep neural network (DNN) periodically on the order of the channel coherence time. We empirically show that the main benefit of this method accrues from the ability of this specially designed DNN to exploit correlations in the time-frequency grid.

Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, thus moving the control logic from the node to a central controller. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature.

Experiments results were conducted using CALB in two scenarios: (1) Master controller is distributing switches among two slave controllers, and (2) master controller is distributing switches among three slave controllers. The paper uses throughput and response time for performance measurement. Results are promising as the performance increased 12\\% in terms of the throughput and 9\\% in terms of the response time when compared to a reference model Enhanced Controller Fault Tolerant fault tolerance technique (ECFT).},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Aly, Wael Hosny Fouad},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/Z5Q49IDN/Aly - Controller Adaptive Load Balancing for SDN Network.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543480348,"version":0,"updated":1563545454896},"$loki":6473},{"itemID":5825,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_uplink_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Uplink {{Scheduling Technique}} for the {{LTE System}} to {{Improve}} the {{Performance}} of the {{NB}}-{{IoT System}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436997/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436997},\n  abstract = {Massive connectivity is one of the major goals of 5G mobile communications.

In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers' behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to define the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed field tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Unlike the half-duplex (HD) cellular systems, the extra residual self-interference (RSI) and the cochannel interference (CCI) are involved in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) received signals due to the simultaneous transmission and reception in an FD base station (BS). Accordingly, we aim at developing the UL and DL precoders to suppress the influence of the RSI and CCI, where the EE criterion is adopted to reach the goal of the green communication. However, the EE precoder design is a fractional non-convex problem. To find the tractable solution, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) method to conduct the DL and UL precoders iteratively. For given DL precoders, the closed-form solution of UL precoders can be eventually yielded by an iterative water-filling (IWF) procedure. Nevertheless, the similar method cannot directly be applied to optimize the DL precoders. We then resort to the UL-DL duality that transfers the DL precoder design to an equivalent UL precoder design problem. We further apply the primal-dual decomposition to the DL precoder design and solve it by the IWF algorithm.

New type of connectivity used in LowPower Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech's LoRaTM technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes - LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our findings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks.

The result of the charge measured in the charging EV can be different from the charge amount claimed to be charged in the charging station. This is because the charge is measured separately from each other using its smart meters. And if mechanical measurements are assumed to be accurate, it is possible to lie in one of the EV or charging station. Also, billing information can be manipulated. To prevent those problems, this paper proposes the blockchain based billing system. The EV and the charging station store the billing information in the blockchain after mutual authentication and prevent the modification. A blockchain is the system in which all nodes have the same ledger, therefore cannot be tampered with. This prevents a user from modifying the record after charging.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {308-310},\n  author = {Jeong, Seohyeon and Dao, Nhu-Ngoc and Lee, Yunseong and Lee, Cheol and Cho, Sungrae},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3IJGP3TF/Jeong et al. - 2018 - Blockchain Based Billing System for Electric Vehic.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543481492,"version":0,"updated":1563545454764},"$loki":6491},{"itemID":3391,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{collotta_novel_2012,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Palermo, Italy}},\n  title = {A {{Novel Road Monitoring Approach Using Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-1233-2 978-0-7695-4687-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6245667/},\n  doi = {10.1109/CISIS.2012.37},\n  abstract = {This paper shows an innovative Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) architecture based on a flexible Quality of Service (QoS) approach for road traffic management.

In the field of face recognition, researches using DNN have been carried out. However, face adversarial example is a serious threat in face recognition system. Face adversarial example adding a little of noise to the original face image can cause the misrecognition in the face recognition system. For example, an attacker intentionally modifies a face image with small distortion, which could cause the face recognition system to misidentify another person. It also shows the possibility of wrong recognition by another person when it is modulated by several points on the face. However, the concept of face friendsafe adversarial example can be useful in a military situation where friend and enemy forces are mixed. In the face recognition field, face friend-safe adversarial example may be needed that is correctly recognized by a friend face recognition system and misidentified by an enemy face recognition system. In this paper, we propose a face friend-safe adversarial example targeting the FaceNet face recognition system. The proposed scheme generates a face friend-safe adversarial example that is misrecognized by a enemy face recognition system but is correctly recognized by friend face recognition system with minimum distortion.

Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler's objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T . To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T . This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward ``variation'' and the minimal achievable regret, and by establishing a connection between the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},\n  booktitle = NIPS,\n  date = {2014},\n  author = {Gur, Yonatan and Zeevi, Assaf J. and Besbes, Omar},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/USD3V3PR/Gur et al_2014_Stochastic Multi-Armed-Bandit Problem with Non-stationary Rewards.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543483524,"version":0,"updated":1563545453386},"$loki":6500},{"itemID":4463,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{baccelli_riot_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{RIOT}}: {{An Open Source Operating System}} for {{Low}}-{{End Embedded Devices}} in the {{IoT}}},\n  volume = {5},\n  issn = {2327-4662, 2372-2541},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8315125/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JIOT.2018.2815038},\n  shorttitle = {{{RIOT}}},\n  abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges, compact operating systems are required on low-end devices to ease development and portability of IoT applications.

LPWAN devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multi-hop network. However, to ensure efficient and reliable communication LPWAN devices often provide a large number of transmission parameters. For example, a LoRa device can be configured to use different spreading factors, bandwidth settings, coding rates and transmission powers, resulting in over 6720 possible settings. It is a challenge to determine the setting that minimises transmission energy cost while meeting the required communication performance. This paper is the first to present a thorough analysis of the impact of LoRa transmission parameter selection on communication performance. We study in detail the impact of parameter settings on energy consumption and communication reliability. Using this study we develop a link probing regime which enables us to quickly determine transmission settings that satisfy performance requirements. The presented work is a first step towards an automated mechanism for LoRa transmission parameter selection that a deployed LoRa network requires, but is not yet specified within the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) framework.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Distributed Computing}} in {{Sensor Systems}} ({{DCOSS}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Distributed Computing}} in {{Sensor Systems}} ({{DCOSS}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-30},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {27-34},\n  author = {Bor, Martin and Roedig, Utz},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MXY9SFZN/Bor and Roedig - 2017 - LoRa Transmission Parameter Selection.pdf},\n  note = {00042}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543483590,"version":0,"updated":1563545454210},"$loki":6503},{"itemID":3818,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{helou_radio_2013,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Lyon, France}},\n  title = {Radio Access Selection Approaches in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-0428-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6673408/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WiMOB.2013.6673408},\n  abstract = {Along with the rapid growth of mobile broadband traffic, multiple radio access technologies (RATs) are being integrated and jointly managed.

On the other hand, mobiles also integrate their needs and preferences to select their access technology so as to maximize their own utility. In comparison with other RAT selection techniques, including network-centric, hybrid and user-centric methods, simulation results prove the efficiency of our hybrid approach in enhancing resource utilization and maximizing user satisfaction.},\n  eventtitle = {2013 {{IEEE}} 9th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2013 {{IEEE}} 9th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-14},\n  date = {2013-10},\n  pages = {521-528},\n  author = {Helou, Melhem El and Ibrahim, Marc and Lahoud, Samer and Khawam, Kinda},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HG9H96IA/Helou et al. - 2013 - Radio access selection approaches in heterogeneous.pdf},\n  note = {00013}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543483796,"version":0,"updated":1563545453194},"$loki":6504},{"itemID":4456,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@video{pham_extreme_,\n  title = {Extreme Low-Cost \\& Low-Power {{LoRa IoT DIY}} Tutorial},\n  url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsKbJeeav_M},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  director = {{Pham}},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543483806,"version":0,"updated":1563545453540},"$loki":6505},{"itemID":4739,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pujolle_cell_2019i,\n  title = {{{CELL Cours}}-5-{{GP}}-{{Wi}}-{{Fi}}},\n  date = {2019},\n  author = {Pujolle},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/AIWP6WYX/Cours-5-GP-Wi-Fi.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543483816,"version":0,"updated":1563545453702},"$loki":6506},{"itemID":5740,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kang_study_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {A {{Study}} on the {{Effect}} of {{Moving}} Small Cell in {{Heterogeneous Networks}} with {{Interference Cancellation}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436766/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436766},\n  abstract = {Wireless data traffic is growing exponentially with the spread of smartphones and tablet PCs.

It provides unconditional secure communication based on the laws of physics. From the viewpoint of network research, QKD is considered to be a component for providing secure communication in network systems. A QKD network enables each node to exchange encryption keys with arbitrary nodes. However previous research did not focus on the processing speed of the key management method essential for a QKD network. This paper focuses on the key management method assuming a high-speed QKD system for which we clarify the design, propose a high-speed method, and evaluate the throughput. The proposed method consists of four modules: (1) local key manager handling the keys generated by QKD, (2) one-time pad tunnel manager establishing the transparent encryption link, (3) global key manager generating the keys for application communication, and (4) web API providing keys to the application. The proposed method was implemented in software and evaluated by emulating QKD key generation and application key consumption. The evaluation result reveals that it is capable of handling the encryption keys at a speed of 414 Mb/s, 185 Mb/s, 85 Mb/s and 971 Mb/s, for local key manager, one-time pad tunnel manager, global key manager and web API, respectively. These are sufficient for integration with a high-speed QKD system. Furthermore, the method allows the high-speed QKD system consisting of two nodes to expand corresponding to the size of the QKD network without losing the speed advantage.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Takahashi, Ririka and Tanizawa, Yoshimichi and Dixon, Alexander},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/E99P9AEB/Takahashi et al. - A high-speed key management method for quantum key.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543484070,"version":0,"updated":1563545454560},"$loki":6510},{"itemID":5669,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_indoor_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Indoor {{Semantic Segmentation}} for {{Robot Navigating}} on {{Mobile}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436956/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436956},\n  abstract = {In recent years, there have been many successes of using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) in the task of pixel-level classification (also called \"semantic image segmentation\").

For example, the LoRa radio protocol enables connecting remote sensors at a distance as long as ten kilometers in a line-of-sight. However, the large area covered also brings several difficulties, such as the placement of sensing devices in regards to topology in geography, or the variability of communication latency. Sensing the environment also carries constraints related to the interest of sensing points in relation to a physical phenomenon. Thus, criteria for designs are evolving a lot from the existing methods, especially in complex terrains. This article describes simulation techniques based on geography analysis to compute long-range radio coverages and radio characteristics in these situations. As radio propagation is just a particular case of physical phenomena, it is shown how a unified approach also allows for characterizing the behavior of potential physical risks. The case of heavy rainfall and flooding is investigated. Geography analysis is achieved using segmentation tools to produce cellular systems which are in turn translated into code for high-performance computations. The paper provides results from practical complex terrain experiments using LoRa, which confirm the accuracy of the simulation, and scheduling characteristics for sample networks.

The proposed ANN is continuously trained by using the horizontal shift imposed on GPS points and once it is trained, it will be used to correct raw GPS points before inputting them into the map-matching algorithm. Integrating the proposed ANN enabled an existing map-matching algorithm to find the correct segments for some of the GPS points where the original map-matching algorithm had failed to do so.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Conference}} on {{Information Reuse}} and {{Integration}} ({{IRI}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Conference}} on {{Information Reuse}} and {{Integration}} ({{IRI}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016-07},\n  pages = {77-86},\n  keywords = {GPS,MapMatching,ML},\n  author = {Hashemi, Mahdi and Karimi, Hassan A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/AUG6X2BX/Hashemi_Karimi_2016_A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accuracy of GPS-Based Map-Matching.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543484552,"version":0,"updated":1563545452858},"$loki":6516},{"itemID":4582,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{briante_supporting_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Supporting Augmented Floating Car Data through Smartphone-Based Crowd-Sensing},\n  volume = {1},\n  issn = {22142096},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214209614000412},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.vehcom.2014.08.002},\n  abstract = {Over the last few years, academia, governmental agencies, automotive and electronic industries have increased their interest in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and services.

The common practice of clinical treatment is gradually being overhauled by ubiquitous healthcare systems. The wireless body area networks (WBANs) are becoming increasingly important for future healthcare applications. According to the human physiological information, WBAN not only sends the real-time notification to the user but also decreases the transmission delay of patient information to the physician for medical decision. When medical emergency information must be transmitted after a disaster occurrence, the number of WBANs and emergency traffic increase in the particular area. In the situations, a large number of WBANs may be close to each other, thus causing inter-WBAN interference and increasing the transmission delay. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dynamic channel selection scheme (DCSS) in IEEE 802.15.6 WBANs. DCSS records the channel interference degree which is used to adaptively select the best transmission channel and to effectively transmit data. It mitigates the inter-WBAN interference to improve the QoS violation and reduce power consumption when there are WBANs coexisting.},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Tseng, Hsueh-Wen and Wang, Yu-Bin and Yang, Yi and Wu, Ruei-Yu},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/9C8JLMEC/Tseng et al. - An Adaptive Channel Hopping Scheme in IEEE 802.15..pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543484594,"version":0,"updated":1563545454544},"$loki":6518},{"itemID":5889,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{jang_low_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {A {{Low Overhead Feedback Scheme}} of {{Channel Covariance Matrix}} for {{Massive MIMO Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436748/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436748},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {714-717},\n  author = {Jang, Youngrok and Lee, Dongheon and Choi, Sooyong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HFSR38I2/Jang et al. - 2018 - A Low Overhead Feedback Scheme of Channel Covarian.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543484612,"version":0,"updated":1563545455104},"$loki":6519},{"itemID":4432,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{moraes_publish_2018,\n  title = {A {{Publish}}/{{Subscribe Qos}}-{{Aware Framework For Massive Iot Traffic Orchestration}}},\n  url = {https://zenodo.org/record/1098298},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1098298},\n  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) application deployment requires the allocation of resources such as virtual machines, storage, and network elements that must be deployed over distinct infrastructures such as cloud computing, Cloud of Things (CoT), datacenters and backbone networks. For massive IoT data acquisition, a gateway-based data aggregation approach is commonly used featuring sensor/ actuator seamless access and providing cache/ buffering and preprocessing functionality. In this perspective, gateways acting as producers need to allocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is proposed a Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework (PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources between aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules IoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally,  the framework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled backbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users and consumers.

The personal information that dealing in CPS has high confidentiality, so the policies and technique will needed to protect the attack in advance. If there is an attack on the CPS, not only personal information but also national confidential data can be leaked. In order to prevent this, the risk is measured using the Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) Model, which can measure risk by element for situational awareness in CPS environment.

To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together. This paper performs a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IoT platforms. Also, the key challenges in this topic is presented.},\n  journaltitle = {Mobile Networks and Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Mobile Netw Appl},\n  urldate = {2019-02-14},\n  date = {2018-07-21},\n  author = {Noura, Mahda and Atiquzzaman, Mohammed and Gaedke, Martin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/F6F7ZABB/Noura et al_2018_Interoperability in Internet of Things.pdf},\n  note = {00004}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543487414,"version":0,"updated":1563545453062},"$loki":6536},{"itemID":4460,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_riot_,\n  title = {{{RIOT}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TLMJNEN6/osis201620160305journee-iotriotbaccelli-160510124208.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543487422,"version":0,"updated":1563545453546},"$loki":6537},{"itemID":5592,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{liu_adaptive_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Adaptive {{Rate Splitting}} for {{Uplink Non}}-{{Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper, a fixed rate splitting (FRS) scheme and an adaptive rate splitting (ARS) scheme are proposed for an uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, in which a near user and a far user communicate with a basestation (BS) using power-domain NOMA. Considering back-off power control, information signal of near user is split into two data streams for uplink transmissions, whereas information signal of far user is transmitted without rate splitting. In the FRS scheme, a fixed power allocation factor is applied at near user for allocating transmit power between data streams. At the BS receiver, successive interference cancellation is applied for recovering all data streams. Motivated by cognitive radio principles, a dynamic power allocation factor is designed for the ARS scheme based on instantaneous channel state information. Closed-form expressions are derived for outage probabilities of the near and far users, respectively. In addition, analytical expressions are derived for asymptotic outage probabilities of the FRS and ARS schemes, respectively. The superior outage performance achieved by the FRS and ARS schemes are corroborated by system-level simulation results.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Liu, Hongwu and Kwak, Kyung Sup},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/YFGCQDQ6/Liu and Kwak - Adaptive Rate Splitting for Uplink Non-Orthogonal .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543487444,"version":0,"updated":1563545454402},"$loki":6538},{"itemID":5697,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{jahromi_applicationaware_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Towards {{Application}}-{{Aware Networking}}: {{ML}}-{{Based End}}-to-{{End Application KPI}}/{{QoE Metrics Characterization}} in {{SDN}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436625/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436625},\n  shorttitle = {Towards {{Application}}-{{Aware Networking}}},\n  abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) presents a unique networking paradigm that facilitates the development of network innovations.

By combining smartphones with existing vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and services when driving. In this paper we propose an Androidbased application that monitors the vehicle through an On Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) interface, being able to detect accidents. Our proposed application estimates the G force experienced by the passengers in case of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to detect accidents. The application reacts to positive detection by sending details about the accident through either e-mail or SMS to pre-defined destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone call to the emergency services. Experimental results using a real vehicle show that the application is able to react to accident events in less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{IEEE}} 36th {{Conference}} on {{Local Computer Networks}} ({{LCN}} 2011)},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{IEEE}} 36th {{Conference}} on {{Local Computer Networks}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-10},\n  pages = {813-819},\n  author = {Zaldivar, Jorge and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WB5YVW29/Zaldivar et al_2011_Providing accident detection in vehicular networks through OBD-II devices and.pdf},\n  note = {00189}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543487716,"version":0,"updated":1563545452934},"$loki":6540},{"itemID":4981,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{cattani_experimental_2017,\n  title = {An Experimental Evaluation of the Reliability of Lora Long-Range Low-Power Wireless Communication},\n  volume = {6},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks},\n  shortjournal = {J.

The data was collected during the cooperative platooning tests that took place in Helmond in the frame of the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge 2016. In the competition, between 8-10 autonomous vehicles formed two platoons in different lanes and were required to merge into a predefined competition zone. The performance is characterized using CAM CCDFs which serves as a base for the evaluation of a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control application. Two important effects has been identified that affect to the reliability of the communications. Firstly, there is a degradation with the distance that appears to be stronger for cars and more gentle for trucks. This indicates that occlusions heavily affect the connectivity of ITS-G5A. Secondly, the reliability is below expectations and some of the vehicles perform consistently worse than others. Although further investigation is required, a possible explanation for this is that a highly congested channel is making some of the vehicles get stuck and are not able to regularly access the channel.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-23},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {1899-1903},\n  author = {Parra, Ignacio and Garcia-Morcillo, Alvaro and Izquierdo, Ruben and Alonso, Javier and Fernandez-Llorca, D. and Sotelo, M.A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MJX82H6U/Parra et al. - 2017 - Analysis of ITS-G5A V2X communications performance.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543488344,"version":0,"updated":1563545453570},"$loki":6549},{"itemID":4515,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{mur_linux_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Linux {{Wi}}-{{Fi}} Open Source Drivers -Mac80211, Ath9k/Ath5k-},\n  date = {2019},\n  pages = {11},\n  author = {Mur, Daniel Camps},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/M5RVP68M/Mur - Linux Wi-Fi open source drivers -mac80211, ath9ka.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543488358,"version":0,"updated":1563545453588},"$loki":6550},{"itemID":5157,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{brown_4g_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{4G}} \\& {{5G}}-{{Ready Network Slicing}}},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {12},\n  author = {Brown, Gabriel},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/E29LA8DN/Brown - 2017 - 4G & 5G-Ready Network Slicing.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543488368,"version":0,"updated":1563545454306},"$loki":6551},{"itemID":5016,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{farooq_search_2018,\n  title = {A {{Search}} into a {{Suitable Channel Access Control Protocol}} for {{LoRa}}-{{Based Networks}}},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE}} 43rd {{Conference}} on {{Local Computer Networks}} ({{LCN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {283--286},\n  author = {Farooq, Muhammad Omer and Pesch, Dirk},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/G62E4THP/Farooq and Pesch - 2018 - A Search into a Suitable Channel Access Control Pr.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/E4FQR9SB/8638225.html},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543488574,"version":0,"updated":1563545454246},"$loki":6552},{"itemID":5656,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kim_simultaneous_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Simultaneous {{Orthogonal Transmission}} for {{Direct Modulation Chirp Spread Spectrum Systems}}},\n  abstract = {A chirp spread spectrum (CSS) is classified into binary orthogonal keying (BOK) method that uses the orthogonal signals and direct modulation (DM) method that uses the antipodal signals.

The conventional base station is broken down into a Remote Radio Head (RRH) and a Base Band Unit (BBU). The RRHs are geographically scattered across multiple sites, whereas the BBUs are sheltered in a data center. In this context, deciding to which RRH users connect is known as the user association problem. As a function of network load conditions, some RRHs may be turned off, reducing network power consumption. Furthermore, RRHs may be mapped to a single BBU, achieving statistical multiplexing gain. Deciding what RRHs are grouped together is known as the RRH clustering problem. Traditionally, user association and RRH clustering are independently addressed. As these two problems are mutually dependent, we provide in this paper a framework for the joint optimization of the user association and the RRH clustering. Our objective is to minimize both the network power consumption and the total transmission delay. As this problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem, it can be solved through exhaustive search. However, the computational complexity becomes intractable as the network size increases. Therefore, we decouple our joint problem into two sub-problems. These sub-problems are iteratively solved until convergence. We further evaluate the performance of our proposed solution. Simulation results show that our optimal solution for the RRH clustering sub-problem outperforms the no-clustering solution, where one BBU is exclusively dedicated to each RRH, and the grand coalition solution, where all RRHs are associated with a single BBU.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {376-381},\n  author = {Taleb, Hussein and Helou, Melhem El and Khawam, Kinda and Lahoud, Samer and Martin, Steven},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SPWG8QVA/Taleb et al. - 2018 - Joint User Association and RRH Clustering in Cloud.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543488636,"version":0,"updated":1563545454794},"$loki":6554},{"itemID":5903,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_analysis_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {An {{Analysis}} of an {{RF Link Budget}} and {{RSSI Circuit Design}} for {{Long}}-{{Range Communications}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436624/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436624},\n  abstract = {It is important for vehicle drivers to obtain useful information through systems such as a global positioning system (GPS), an intelligent transportation system (ITS), or WiFi data communication.

In this paper, network slicing is investigated in LoRa networks over fixed and dynamic slicing strategies. The performance of LoRa slices is evaluated with different spreading factor (SF) configurations. Then, a dynamic inter-slicing algorithm is proposed based on a maximum likelihood estimation that avoids resource starvation and prioritizes a slice over another depending on its QoS requirements. Moreover, a novel intra-slicing strategy is proposed that maximizes resource allocation efficiency of LoRa slices with regard to their delay requirements. An energy module for LoRa in NS3 is also implemented to evaluate the energy consumption of devices in each slice. Simulation results performed in realistic LoRa scenarios highlight the utility of our proposition in improving QoS requirements of IoT devices and providing isolation between slices.},\n  journaltitle = {Future Generation Computer Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Future Gener.

Furthermore, modifications in OFDM waveform for relaxed synchronization and supporting short burst communications for Internet of Things (IoT) devices has paved the way for Universal Filtered MultiCarrier (UFMC) waveform. However, a major disadvantage in deployment of Non-Orthogonal UFMC is the high Peakto-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) being comparable to that of OFDMA. As such, additional PAPR reduction techniques are required for reducing the dynamic range of power amplifier deployed in communication system. We take up Power Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) in which available power is sliced between users and investigate the performance of SC-FDMA for PDNOMA UFMC systems for PAPR reduction. UFMC is known to provide additional diversity to transmitter in uplink and facilitates relaxed synchronization at the receiver side in downlink scenario. Simulation results show that in flat-fading scenario, BER performance of proposed system is found to be significantly better than OFDM and UFMC. However, BER performance of proposed system in AWGN channel is seen to be traded off as the extent of SC-FDMA precoding increases.

Mostly, the IoT concept involves massive end devices distributed over a wide topographical area, hence establishing a high density and large-scale environment. LoRaWAN makes use of six orthogonal spreading factors (SFs) in order to improve spectral efficiency and increase the capacity. In this paper, we focus on the LoRaWAN class A network end devices and the problem of network scalability under high-density urban environment by using both the confirmed and unconfirmed mode of communication.

Advances in MAC protocols have enabled significant lifetime improvements, but in systems with low data rate, idle listening, and other communication artifacts can begin to dominate costs. One proposal to combat this is the addition of a second, extremely low power radio component that is always-on. As a consequence of the extremely low power, such radios are incapable of decoding general data, and thus are often delegated the task of listening for a trigger, leading to the terminology wake-up radio, as this extremely low power radio is used to wake up a higher power radio, which is then used for data communication. While wake-up technology has been steadily evolving over the last decade in the hardware arena, few protocols have been developed to exploit it.

Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model.

It is shown that subject to the channel composition and application requirements, a single cell may include several millions of devices. Also, we show that the capacity of the uplink channel available to a LoRaWAN node strongly depends on the distance from the base station and does not exceed 2 kbit/s.

In addition, it is of increasing interest to researchers, which a group of drones are networked and coordinated to accomplish a mission delivered from Ground Control Station (GCS). To support those service scenarios, communication path should be maintained between GCS and the UAVs, and the UAVs should be able to exchange a message among themselves. However, communication range between GCS and the UAVs is bounded according to the transceiver power and its sensitivity. Hence, a multihop network approach need to be considered. In such multihop networks, routing protocol plays an important role. Accordingly, in this paper, we present a geolocation-based routing protocol for Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs) with multihop network communication. Our protocol shows robust and resilient performance to the dynamic multihop network topology. A network topology composed of UAVs is highly dynamic due to the high speed of UAVs while executing missions. In this circumstance, our protocol uses geolocation information of neighbors and then find the routing path to the destination by only considering the neighbor information, which in turn, results in low overhead and robustness to the dynamic network topology in FANETs. We also provide implementation of the proposed geolocation-based routing protocol and testbed environments.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {50-52},\n  author = {Choi, Sung-Chan and Hussen, Hassen Redwan and Park, Jong-Hong and Kim, Jaeho},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/G2JAF89B/Choi et al. - 2018 - Geolocation-Based Routing Protocol for Flying Ad H.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":17,"created":1563543494572,"version":0,"updated":1563545454622},"$loki":6599},{"itemID":3485,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{dotoli_urban_2004,\n  title = {An Urban Traffic Network Model via Coloured Timed Petri Nets},\n  volume = {37},\n  issn = {1474-6670},\n  url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017307474},\n  doi = {10.1016/S1474-6670(17)30747-4},\n  abstract = {This paper deals with modelling of traffic networks for real time control purposes.

In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard.

These devices are usually battery operated and have a radio transceiver that is typically their most power-hungry block. Wake-up radio schemes can be used to achieve a reasonable balance among energy consumption, range, data receiving capabilities and response time. In this paper, a high-sensitivity low power wake-up radio receiver (WUR) for wireless sensor networks is presented. The wake-up radio is comprised of a fully passive differential RF-toDC converter that rectifies the incident RF signal, a low-power comparator and an ultra low power microcontroller to detects the envelope of the on-off keying (OOK) wake-up data used as address. We designed and implemented a novel low power tunable wake up radio with addressing capability, a minimal power consumption of only 196nW and a maximum sensitivity of -55dBm and minimal wake up time of 130{$\\mu$}s without addressing and around 1,6ms with 2byte addressing at 10Kbit/s data rate. The flexibility of the solution makes the wake up radio suitable for both power constrained low range application (such as Body Area Network) or applications with long range needs. The wake up radio can work also at different frequencies and the addressing capability directly on board helps reduce false positives. Experimental on field results demonstrate the low power of the solution, the high sensitivity and the functionality.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{IEEE}} 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{IEEE}} 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2014-10},\n  pages = {92-99},\n  author = {Magno, Michele and Benini, Luca},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/4N2XTWE6/Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/I2ZFEJCV/Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1563545453938,"version":0},"$loki":6642},{"itemID":4928,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{spenza_duty_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Kowloon, Hong Kong}},\n  title = {Beyond Duty Cycling: {{Wake}}-up Radio with Selective Awakenings for Long-Lived Wireless Sensing Systems},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8381-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7218419/},\n  doi = {10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218419},\n  shorttitle = {Beyond Duty Cycling},\n  abstract = {Emerging wake-up radio technologies have the potential to bring the performance of sensing systems and of the Internet of Things to the levels of low latency and very low energy consumption required to enable critical new applications.

Our WRx features very low power consumption ({$<$} 1.3{$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}W), high sensitivity (up to -55dBm), fast reactivity (wake-up time of 130{$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}s), and selective addressing, a key enabler of new high performance protocols. We then present ALBAWUR, a cross-layer solution for data gathering in sensing systems that redesigns a previous leading protocol, ALBA-R, extending it to exploit the features of our WRx. We evaluate the performance of ALBA-WUR via simulations, showing that the use of the WRx produces remarkable energy savings (up to five orders of magnitude), and achieves lifetimes that are decades longer than those obtained by ALBA-R in sensing systems with duty cycling, while keeping latencies at bay.},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE INFOCOM}} 2015 - {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications}}},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications}} ({{INFOCOM}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2015-04},\n  pages = {522-530},\n  author = {Spenza, Dora and Magno, Michele and Basagni, Stefano and Benini, Luca and Paoli, Mario and Petrioli, Chiara},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6CM74A8X/Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/JLXYXZMT/Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1563545453986,"version":0},"$loki":6643},{"itemID":4929,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{trongnhanle_asynchronous_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Gallipoli}},\n  title = {Asynchronous on Demand {{MAC}} Protocol Using Wake-up Radio in Wireless Body Area Network},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8981-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7184942/},\n  doi = {10.1109/IWASI.2015.7184942},\n  abstract = {A fast growing class of sensing technology is wearable, where network nodes are tightly coupled with the human body. Wireless body area networks (WBAN) technology has gained popularity over the last few years, with a wide range of applications covered, in particular in health and rehabilitation. Wearable and pervasive computing are able to sense, monitor and process the data to provide smart assistance and context-aware ambient intelligence environments. However present-day WBAN devices are mainly battery-powered and due to energy issue they need to be recharged every day or even hours and thus they miss the expectations for a truly unobtrusive user experience. This work presents a novel energy-efscient asynchronous MAC protocol using a nano-watt wake up radio with addressing capabilities to reduce the energy consumption of the communication and then extend the WBAN life time. We present the benests of the wake up radio in a star topology widely used in WBAN where the number of the node is around 5 to 10. The implemented protocol exploiting the low power consumption of the wake up radio, the low latency and the addressing capabilities can increase signiscantly the energy efsciency of the single node and entire network reducing both idle listening and data collisions. Result based on measured power consumption and OMNET++ simulation demonstrate that by using the wake up radio it is possible to reduce the power consumption up to 150 times compared to related protocols and the lifetime can be signiscantly increased in a real world scenario.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 6th {{IEEE International Workshop}} on {{Advances}} in {{Sensors}} and {{Interfaces}} ({{IWASI}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 6th {{International Workshop}} on {{Advances}} in {{Sensors}} and {{Interfaces}} ({{IWASI}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2015-06},\n  pages = {228-233},\n  author = {{Trong Nhan Le} and Pegatoquet, Alain and Magno, Michele},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6FXWF28M/Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/DZBKNYE4/Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1563545454022,"version":0},"$loki":6644},{"itemID":4930,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{schadhauser_design_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Design of {{Autonomous Base Stations}} for {{Low Power Wide Area}} ({{LPWA}}) {{Communication}}},\n  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), Machine-to-MachineCommunication (M2M) and Industry 4.0 are keywords arousing great research interest in recent years. All these terms incorporate the idea of data exchange among diverse objects in wireless sensor networks. In a previous paper, we extended the domain of sensorbased applications to the scope of wildlife tracking, in particular the tracking of bats. The concept of a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) sensor network was introduced, built up by lightweight Ultra Low Power (ULP) nodes attached to the back of the animals, transmitting sensor data via long range telemetry over a distance of several kilometers. The network architecture was discussed and suitable transmission schemes meeting the harsh energy and weight restrictions were evaluated. For an optimal system performance, however, it is also essential that the receiving network is properly designed. In this paper, we elaborate the development of a LPWA reception network of telemetry-related base stations, tackling the highly demanding requirements for mobility, energy efficiency and remote maintainability. Both, hardware as well as software components are addressed and their interactions are illustrated. The energetically self-sustaining base stations are equipped with directional and omni-directional antennas in a MIMO-like fashion. A Software Defined Radio (SDR) controlled frontend allows for a flexible reception and fast data processing. The operation performance toward the stated requirements is evaluated. Finally, initial results of field trials in Berlin (Germany) are presented, proofing the successful recording of actual bat signals.},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Schadhauser, Michael and Robert, Joerg and Heuberger, Albert},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/PFGYQRYL/Schadhauser et al. - 2017 - Design of Autonomous Base Stations for Low Power W.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/VB2QFR3F/Schadhauser et al. - 2017 - Design of Autonomous Base Stations for Low Power W.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1563545454042,"version":0},"$loki":6645},{"itemID":4931,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{blanckenstein_energy_2012,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Energy {{Efficient Clustering}} Using a {{Wake}}-up {{Receiver}}},\n  abstract = {We present a new energy-saving method for creating node clusters with similar sensor readings.

Duty cycling, however, does not eliminate idle listening, comes at the price of longer latencies and obtains lifetimes that are still insufficient for many critical applications. Using a wake-up receiver (WUR) allows actual communications on the main radio only for transmission or reception, virtually eliminating node idling. However, the range of current WUR prototypes is still significantly shorter than that of the main radio, which can challenge the use of existing WSN protocols in WUR-based networks. In this paper we present an approach to mitigate this limitation of wake-up-based networks. In particular, we show that the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP), a standard protocol for data gathering in WSNs, suitably redefined to work on WUR-endowed nodes, achieves lifetimes of several decades. This constitutes a remarkable improvement over duty cycle-based solutions, where CTP makes the network lasts only a handful of months. At the same time, our WUR-based approach obtains data latencies comparable to those obtained by keeping the main radio always on.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2016-02},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Basagni, Stefano and Petrioli, Chiara and Spenza, Dora},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/GP7HG8CE/Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XM6RSEUR/Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1563545454110,"version":0},"$loki":6648},{"itemID":4934,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{seyedmazloum_dcwmac_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{San Francisco, CA, USA}},\n  title = {{{DCW}}-{{MAC}}: {{An Energy Efficient Medium Access Scheme Using Duty}}-{{Cycled Low}}-{{Power Wake}}-{{Up Receivers}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4244-8327-3 978-1-4244-8328-0 978-1-4244-8325-9 978-1-4244-8326-6},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6093231/},\n  doi = {10.1109/VETECF.2011.6093231},\n  shorttitle = {{{DCW}}-{{MAC}}},\n  abstract = {In this work we present a new low-power medium access scheme for sensor-type networks specifically with low traffic intensity.
