The massive number of connected devices associated to its random spatial deployment and random network access introduce new degrees of freedom, demanding for innovative performance evaluation approaches. In this paper we study the interference caused to a LoRa gateway due to the uplink transmissions of multiple coexisting LoRa devices. By admitting an uniform spatial distribution of the devices, we show that the aggregate interference caused to a LoRa gateway follows a nonGaussian distribution and its power can be approximated by a sum of independent non-identical gamma random variables. Our work adopts a typical LoRaWAN operating scenario where the transmissions of LoRa Class A devices are affected by path-loss, shadowing and Rayleigh fading. Numerical results obtained with the modeling methodology are compared with simulation results, and the validation of the proposed model is discussed for different transmission probabilities.},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Irio, Luis and Oliveira, Rodolfo},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TLWBA2M8/Irio and Oliveira - Modeling the Interference caused to a LoRaWAN Gate.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783440756,"version":0,"updated":1563899940498},"$loki":839},{"itemID":3248,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{debbah_wireless_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Wireless {{AI}}: {{Challenges}} and {{Opportunities}}},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {52},\n  author = {Debbah, M\\'erouane},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/AMH4ZCA3/Debbah_Wireless AI.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783441046,"version":0,"updated":1563899939294},"$loki":840},{"itemID":5559,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{chu_interference_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Interference {{Analysis}} of {{Directional UAV Networks}}: {{A Stochastic Geometry Approach}}},\n  abstract = {We characterize the interference characteristics of directional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks based on the stochastic geometry, where each UAV is equipped with a directional antenna and is placed in three dimensional (3D) locations.

We also show that the module correctly represents the capture effect that lowers the packet drop rate due to collisions. Second, we want to improve the performance of LoRa devices while not impacting energy consumption, the aspect that usually is not taken into account in the literature. We use the simulator to evaluate CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), a simple enhancement to LoRaWAN that lowers the collision ratio. The simulation results show that CSMA considerably lowers the collision ratio while only slightly increasing energy consumption. We also observe that CSMA presents lower energy consumption than LoRa for a large number of devices. Another advantage of CSMA consists of increased throughput and larger network capacity because the ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle do not longer apply.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}} 2018)},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-13},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  pages = {1-7},\n  keywords = {PDR,Tx},\n  author = {To, Thanh-Hai and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SSLB3I38/To and Duda - 2018 - Simulation of LoRa in NS-3 Improving LoRa Perform.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783442136,"version":0,"updated":1563899939804},"$loki":852},{"itemID":4331,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{vandenabeele_scalability_2017,\n  title = {Scalability {{Analysis}} of {{Large}}-{{Scale LoRaWAN Networks}} in Ns-3},\n  volume = {4},\n  issn = {2327-4662},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090518/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JIOT.2017.2768498},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Internet of Things Journal},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Internet Things J.},\n  urldate = {2019-05-13},\n  date = {2017-12},\n  pages = {2186-2198},\n  keywords = {PDR,SF},\n  author = {Van den Abeele, Floris and Haxhibeqiri, Jetmir and Moerman, Ingrid and Hoebeke, Jeroen},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/DZ39YPUU/Van den Abeele et al_2017_Scalability Analysis of Large-Scale LoRaWAN Networks in ns-3.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783442166,"version":0,"updated":1563899939818},"$loki":853},{"itemID":5812,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{back_study_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Study}} on the {{Election}} of {{Suitable Leader Vehicle}} in {{Vehicle Platooning Using}} the {{Raft Algorithm}}},\n  abstract = {Existing vehicle platooning creates platooning of vehicles with the same destination, and the leader vehicle manages the platooning.

In this paper the use of a LoRa technology, originally developed for IoT, is investigated with the aim of implementing distributed measurement systems. After the conclusion that LoRa (Long Range) and LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network) architectures show a good match with measurement systems, the paper focuses on the characterization of time related performance indicators that are important for distributed systems.

In this paper, we design the AoT compilation system for IoT-Cloud virtual machine system. The designed system is suitable for the convergence environment of the IoT and the cloud.

For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

However, a flooding based routing protocol can address these challenges with its multipath characteristics. If the network uses a flooding based routing protocol, not only DATA but also ACK messages are transmitted through multiple paths. Although the messages are transmitted through multiple paths, we cannot avoid the packet loss completely. So, in order to provide high reliability of delivering messages, we need a retransmission mechanism. Though, if the network uses conventional transport layer protocol such as TCP, it will cause a spurious retransmission problem because it was not designed for the multipath environment. To overcome this problem, we suggest Path Similarity based Spurious Retransmission Minimization over Flooding based Routing in UWSN.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-01-18},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {17-24},\n  author = {Jones, Tyler and Dali, Aniket and Rao, Manoj Ramesh and Biradar, Neha and Madassery, Jean and Liu, Kaikai},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/LPZF5AGW/Jones et al_2018_Towards a Layered and Secure Internet-of-Things Testbed via Hybrid Mesh.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783445544,"version":0,"updated":1563899939360},"$loki":888},{"itemID":3775,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{richardson_rpl_2018,\n  title = {{{RPL}}- {{Routing}} over {{Low Power}} and {{Lossy Networks}}},\n  url = {https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/94/slides/slides-94-rtgarea-2.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-02-18},\n  date = {2018},\n  author = {Richardson, Michael},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/KQXYV8J2/slides-94-rtgarea-2.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783445562,"version":0,"updated":1563899939502},"$loki":889},{"itemID":5068,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@thesis{avilacampos_evaluacion_2017,\n  title = {Evaluaci\\'on Del Rango de Transmisi\\'on de {{LoRa}} Para Redes de Sensores Inal\\'ambricas Con {{LoRaWAN}} En Ambientes Forestales},\n  type = {B.S. thesis},\n  date = {2017},\n  author = {Avila Campos, Pablo Esteban},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/85XKGVWP/Avila Campos - 2017 - Evaluación del rango de transmisión de LoRa para r.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/C2QJP6SJ/po.es.en.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/PUQEAQ28/poL.es.en.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783445576,"version":0,"updated":1563899940306},"$loki":890},{"itemID":5674,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_trajectory_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Trajectory {{Optimization}} of {{Energy Efficient FSOC}}-{{UAV}} with {{Atmospheric}} and {{Geometric Loss}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436588/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436588},\n  abstract = {This paper address the issues of optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using free-space optical communication (FSOC).

In order for the resulting image to represent the detail information and to achieve the one-to-one correspondence without color distortion like color leakage, hue shift, and luminance shift, the proposed tone mapping operator consists of two parameters by using logarithmic function and power function, respectively. In addition, the adaptive gamma correction is used to control the dynamic range in the given image, parameter free. Thereafter, the resulting image is finally processed by using CAM16 to deal with mismatch between real-life scene and displayed image.

We report on data gathered with four capture devices from nearly 50 experimental runs conducted with vehicles on a rural highway. Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\\% of overall throughput, 15\\% of the time. (2) We quantify the effects of ten problems caused by the mechanics of existing protocols that are responsible for this throughput loss; and (3) We recommend best practices for using vehicular opportunistic connections. Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be significantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP. The central message in this paper is that wireless conditions in the vicinity of a roadside access point are predictable, and by exploiting this information, vehicular opportunistic access can be greatly improved.},\n  eventtitle = {The 5th International Conference},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on {{Mobile}} Systems, Applications and Services  - {{MobiSys}} '07},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-30},\n  date = {2007},\n  pages = {206},\n  author = {Hadaller, David and Keshav, Srinivasan and Brecht, Tim and Agarwal, Shubham},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XNDIFU6Z/Hadaller et al. - 2007 - Vehicular opportunistic communication under the mi.pdf},\n  note = {00273}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783446122,"version":0,"updated":1563899940002},"$loki":896},{"itemID":4840,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{farris_survey_21,\n  title = {A {{Survey}} on {{Emerging SDN}} and {{NFV Security Mechanisms}} for {{IoT Systems}}},\n  volume = {21},\n  issn = {1553-877X, 2373-745X},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8424018/},\n  doi = {10.1109/COMST.2018.2862350},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

Actually, visual sensor networks may need to be highly dynamic, reflecting the changing of parameters in smart cities. In this context, characteristics of visual sensors and conditions of the monitored environment, as well as the status of other concurrent monitoring systems, may affect how visual sensors collect, encode and transmit information. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based approach to dynamically configure the way visual sensors will operate concerning sensing, coding and transmission patterns, exploiting different types of reference parameters.

In this paper we consider a scenario with a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas serving four users, clustered into two groups of two users each, equipped with a single antenna. This simple but relevant scenario allows to capture the main features of NOMA systems, where in each cluster the user having the best channel applies successive interference cancellation (SIC) to remove the signal intended for the other user in the same cluster, while the other user treats interference as noise. Moreover interference among the two clusters also is treated as additional noise. In this scenario we address the problem of beamformer design and power allocation for the four users with the aim of minimizing the total transmit power while satisfying a minimum rate constraint for each user. Starting from the zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) beamformers we propose five solutions based on suitable combinations of fixed beamformers to simplify the beamformer design and power allocation. The performance of the proposed solutions is compared in terms of total consumed power and complexity of the various solutions.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {370-375},\n  author = {Piccoli, Carlo and Tomasin, Stefano and Jorswieck, Eduard},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/RV434KSC/Piccoli et al. - 2018 - Beamformer Design and Power Allocation for Two-Clu.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783446524,"version":0,"updated":1563899940746},"$loki":902},{"itemID":5885,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{chung_route_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Route {{Plan Exchange Scheme Based}} on {{Block Chain}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436761/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436761},\n  abstract = {Route Plan describes recommended movement of vessels.

In addition, we show that this malicious activity appears to follow a power-law distribution by categorizing the source IP addresses of these attacks based on the originating country and analyzing the frequency of these attacks.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {878-880},\n  author = {Lee, Jae-Kook and Kim, Sung-Jun and Hong, Taeyoung and Joh, Minsu and Chae, Huiseung},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HTJ5XJ77/Lee et al. - 2018 - Malicious Activity Against an HPC Service Environm.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783447030,"version":0,"updated":1563899941126},"$loki":907},{"itemID":3793,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@incollection{gomes_qosaware_2018,\n  location = {{Cham}},\n  title = {{{QoS}}-{{Aware Resource Allocation}} for {{Mobile IoT Pub}}/{{Sub Systems}}},\n  volume = {10972},\n  isbn = {978-3-319-94369-5 978-3-319-94370-1},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-94370-1_6},\n  booktitle = {Internet of {{Things}} \\textendash{} {{ICIOT}} 2018},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-11},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {70-87},\n  keywords = {Queueing},\n  author = {Gomes, Raphael and Bouloukakis, Georgios and Costa, F\\'abio and Georgantas, Nikolaos and family=Rocha, given=Ricardo, prefix=da, useprefix=true},\n  editor = {Georgakopoulos, Dimitrios and Zhang, Liang-Jie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/S4TGUIKN/Gomes et al_2018_QoS-Aware Resource Allocation for Mobile IoT Pub-Sub Systems.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783447282,"version":0,"updated":1563899939516},"$loki":908},{"itemID":4026,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{piyare_ondemand_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Limassol}},\n  title = {On-{{Demand TDMA}} for {{Energy Efficient Data Collection}} with {{LoRa}} and {{Wake}}-up {{Receiver}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-6876-4},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8589151/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WiMOB.2018.8589151},\n  abstract = {Low-power and long-range communication technologies such as LoRa are becoming popular in IoT applications due to their ability to cover kilometers range with milliwatt of power consumption. One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the traffic congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa.

Different standards are being proposed to meet these novel requirements. In this paper, the technical differences between a wideband spread spectrum (LoRa-like) and an ultra narrowband (Sigfox-like) network will be explained and evaluated. On the physical layer, simulation results show that an ultra narrowband network has a larger coverage, while wideband spread spectrum networks are less sensitive to interference. When considering the contention between nodes and interference between different networks, simulations show that adaptation of frequency and modulation is imperative for efficiently dealing with varying contention and interference in long range unlicensed networks. Depending on network load, size and distance, a device in a wideband network can send 6 times more packets to the base station when there is active rate and frequency management and an intra-technology control plane.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 23rd {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 23rd {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2016-05},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  keywords = {PDR,SIR,BW},\n  author = {Reynders, Brecht and Meert, Wannes and Pollin, Sofie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6N58H7R5/Reynders et al. - 2016 - Range and coexistence analysis of long range unlic.pdf},\n  note = {00082}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783447912,"version":0,"updated":1563899939790},"$loki":917},{"itemID":5624,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{sajjad_improving_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Improving {{Spectrum Sensing}} and {{Reporting}} via {{Multi}}-{{Antenna}} in {{Cognitive Radio Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Spectrum sensing is a vital functionality of cognitive radio network to identify an available spectrum for secondary users to enhance spectrum utilization and to avoid harmful interference to licensed users.

That is why, IoT is presently spanning over a diverse range of applications in the fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, military, industry, etc. The resources IoT requires in those applications are heterogeneous in nature, for example, storage, processor, network, sensor nodes, energy, etc. The obvious challenge is how to manage these limited resources efficiently. Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed.

Wireless body area networks (WBAN) technology has gained popularity over the last few years, with a wide range of applications covered, in particular in health and rehabilitation. Wearable and pervasive computing are able to sense, monitor and process the data to provide smart assistance and context-aware ambient intelligence environments. However present-day WBAN devices are mainly battery-powered and due to energy issue they need to be recharged every day or even hours and thus they miss the expectations for a truly unobtrusive user experience. This work presents a novel energy-efscient asynchronous MAC protocol using a nano-watt wake up radio with addressing capabilities to reduce the energy consumption of the communication and then extend the WBAN life time. We present the benests of the wake up radio in a star topology widely used in WBAN where the number of the node is around 5 to 10. The implemented protocol exploiting the low power consumption of the wake up radio, the low latency and the addressing capabilities can increase signiscantly the energy efsciency of the single node and entire network reducing both idle listening and data collisions. Result based on measured power consumption and OMNET++ simulation demonstrate that by using the wake up radio it is possible to reduce the power consumption up to 150 times compared to related protocols and the lifetime can be signiscantly increased in a real world scenario.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 6th {{IEEE International Workshop}} on {{Advances}} in {{Sensors}} and {{Interfaces}} ({{IWASI}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 6th {{International Workshop}} on {{Advances}} in {{Sensors}} and {{Interfaces}} ({{IWASI}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2015-06},\n  pages = {228-233},\n  author = {{Trong Nhan Le} and Pegatoquet, Alain and Magno, Michele},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6FXWF28M/Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/DZBKNYE4/Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783449146,"version":0,"updated":1563899940194},"$loki":932},{"itemID":5702,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{zanjani_path_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Path {{Provisioning}} for {{Fibbing Controlled Load Balanced IP Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436993/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436993},\n  abstract = {With the help of distributed link state routing protocols, IP networks are highly reliable and robust. However, routing in IP networks are relatively inflexible. Flows can follow only shortest paths toward their destinations. In contrast, Software Defined Networking (SDN) offers finegrained control over routing, at the expense of controller overhead, failover latency, and deployment challenges. The best choice is to combine both approaches to achieve ``central control over the distributed route computation'' paradigm. Recently a new idea called Fibbing is proposed to realize flexible fine-grained control in conventional IP networks. Fibbing as an alternative loop-free destination based solution brings the flexibility for traditional networks without changing router configurations and/or protocols. The Fibbing controller can steer a traffic flow to follow any specific route. However, how to achieve traffic engineering through dynamic traffic monitoring and route computation is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a framework to achieve an optimized load balancing solution for a Fibbing controlled network. In our system, there are a light weight traffic monitoring module, a demand estimation module, and an optimization engine for routing path computation. The system periodically determines a set of routing paths to the Fibbing controller for path provisioning. In order to evaluate the performance, we have implemented the whole system in a testbed. The experimental results show that the average time for file transfer is significantly reduced with the support of the proposed system.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {154-158},\n  author = {Zanjani, Saeed Barkabi and Li, Kuang-Yi and Lee, Steven S.

WiFi fingerprinting, which estimates the user's locations using precollecting WiFi signals as references, is of particular interest since these days, every user can easily access to WiFi networks. Among numerous methods, deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods have shown an attractive performance but their major drawback is the sensitivity to the fluctuation of received signals (caused by multipaths). To yield a satisfactory performance, thus, a sufficiently large number of possible cases should be trained, which costs a lot. In this paper, we address the above problem by presenting a convolutional neural network (CNN) based localization method. As success in image classifications, the proposed method can be robust to the small changes of received signals as it exploits the topology of a radio map as well as signal strengths.

In Malaysia, the statistics reveal that residential energy consumption has been on a steady increase due to the growing population as well as a lack of awareness within households regarding proper energy utilization that causes significant amount of energy wastage. The emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a consequence and convergence of several key technologies such as real-time analytics, machine learning, sensors and embedded systems. The application of intelligence in IoT, known as Cognitive IoT (CIoT), will enable decision making based on historical data, and automatically train, learn and troubleshoot future issues. This project proposes a smart energy monitoring system for home appliances incorporating CIoT which consists of three parts. Firstly, a Raspberry Pi-based smart plug serving as the gateway, that is able to read current data from individual home appliances, load the trained model from training server and test the verified data using the model. Secondly, Google Colab as the training server will be used to store the training data set and building the Tensorflow-based Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model. This recurrent neural network model will forecast electricity bill and notify users if abnormal energy consumption of individual home appliances is detected. Thirdly, a dashboard using Matplotlib library where users may monitor the real-time energy consumption. The completed LSTM model demonstrates a high accuracy of more than 80\\%, where a low mean squared error with train score = 0.1798 and test score = 0.1229 is determined.

We mount the sensors on a specially designed hexagonal plate, while considering each camera-LIDAR combination as an independent multi-sensor unit. For each unit, we simultaneously capture chessboard images and their three-dimensional (3D) point data at a few different orientations. Twodimensional (2D) chess corners are reprojected into 3D space for plane fitting. RANSAC algorithm is applied on LIDAR points before they are used for plane fitting. The mutual rotation between the camera and LIDAR is calculated by aligning the normal vectors of plane fitting results. An arbitrary point from the camera plane is projected on to the LIDAR plane and the distance is minimized to estimate the mutual translation. The accuracy of this proposed method is evaluated through scene fusion experiments.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Kim, Eung-su and Park, Soon-Yong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6R988DU4/Kim and Park - Extrinsic calibration of a camera-LIDAR multi sens.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783450286,"version":0,"updated":1563899940394},"$loki":947},{"itemID":4732,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pujolle_cell_2019b,\n  title = {{{CELL C2}}-{{GSM}}},\n  date = {2019},\n  author = {Pujolle},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/DLSKUQV7/C2-GSM.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783450518,"version":0,"updated":1563899940060},"$loki":948},{"itemID":5672,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{nam_ber_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {{{BER Analysis}} of {{Wavelength Division Multiplexing}}-{{Based Multiple Beam Scheduling Scheme Based}} on {{Gamma Approximation Channel}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436739/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436739},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we statistically analyze the BER performance of a threshold-based parallel multiple beam selection scheme for a free-space optical (FSO) based system with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in cases where a pointing error has occurred under Gamma turbulence conditions, which are a good approximation of Gamma-Gamma distribution.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016-10-21},\n  author = {family=Heijden, given=Rens W., prefix=van der, useprefix=true and Dietzel, Stefan and Leinm\\\"uller, Tim and Kargl, Frank},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W67H3GPW/van der Heijden et al_2016_Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation.pdf},\n  note = {00020}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783450854,"version":0,"updated":1563899939312},"$loki":952},{"itemID":3648,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{hu_survey_24,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Survey}} on {{Software}}-{{Defined Network}} and {{OpenFlow}}: {{From Concept}} to {{Implementation}}},\n  volume = {16},\n  issn = {1553-877X},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6819788},\n  doi = {10.1109/COMST.2014.2326417},\n  shorttitle = {A {{Survey}} on {{Software}}-{{Defined Network}} and {{OpenFlow}}},\n  abstract = {Software-defined network (SDN) has become one of the most important architectures for the management of largescale complex networks, which may require repolicing or reconfigurations from time to time.

To achieve low power consumption, every node periodically schedules its radio transceiver into sleep or active state, which is usually called duty cycle mechanism in MAC protocol. In this paper, we design a novel Prediction-Based Asynchronous MAC protocol (PBA-MAC) for heavy traffic load in wireless sensor networks. PBA-MAC applies an efficient wakeup mechanism to save the energy of a sensor node as much as possible. It reduces communication cost by enabling a sender to predict the intended receiver's wakeup time, without introducing unnecessary idle listening or overhearing cost. In addition, it introduces an exponential advance mechanism to handle the prediction error caused by clock drift and hardware platform latency. More importantly, its backcast-based retransmission characteristic can efficiently resolve severe wireless collisions caused by concurrent traffic flows. The PBA-MAC is implemented in Contiki operating system. We compare PBA-MAC to some existing energy-efficient MAC protocols. The experimental results show that PBAMAC significantly improves network energy efficiency and reduces packet delivery latency even under heavy traffic load.},\n  journaltitle = {AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications},\n  shortjournal = {AEU - Int.

Although it is a common belief that this figure could shrink with the use of new sensor and communication technologies, unfortunately, none such systems have hit the road to date. Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we fill this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system specifically devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios. Our experiments confirm what has been observed before in theory and simulation, i.e., the use of such a system can reduce, by as much as 40\\%, the amount of vehicles involved in highway pileups.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

However, in the conventional method, the P-QRS-T wave must be accurately detected, and the feature value is extracted through the P-QRS-T wave. If an error occurs in the peak detection or feature extraction process, the accuracy becomes very low. Therefore, in this paper, we implement a system that can perform PVC (Premature Ventricular Contraction) and PAC (Premature Atrial Contraction) classification by using P-QRS-T peak value without feature extraction process using deep neural network.

Many Electronic Control Units (ECUs) have been installed in the vehicle to support ADAS, and massive data stream flows over the in-vehicle network. Therefore, the Ethernet backbone, which can guarantee the high bandwidth, has emerged as an in-vehicle communication technology. However, security on automotive Ethernet has not yet been proposed. The IEEE MACsec with IEEE 802.1X Authentication and Key Management (AKM) may be applied for the in-vehicle secure communication, but it has a constraint that its security scope is based on a point-to-point approach. Whenever a frame arrives at the switches in the transmission path, the decryption and reencryption of the frame are repeated. It may adversely affect the performance of ADAS related to the driver's safety by increasing the end-to-end latency. We therefore propose a new MACsec extension over the Software-Defined Networks (SDN) for an invehicle secure communication, which is based on IEEE 802.1X authentication mechanism. The proposed scheme extends the security scope of MACsec from point-to-point to end-to-end by delegating AKM process of ECUs and switches to SDN controller. It could minimize the cryptographic processes of the ECUs and switches without any modification of the existing MACsec standard, and could protect an automotive system from any manipulation by unauthorized third parties.

We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area.

Edge Computing for mobile networks is a new technology which is currently under standardization providing an IT service environment and cloud-computing capabilities at the edge of the mobile network in close proximity to the mobile end users. The aim of this technology is to reduce latency, ensure highly efficient network operation and service delivery, providing improved user experience. All of these can be translated into value and can create opportunities for operators, application and content providers enabling them to better utilize the mobile broadband capabilities. Furthermore, edge computing enables a new value chain for end users but also for industries allowing to efficient deliver their applications over the mobile network providing fresh business opportunities and new use cases. FEC is a feedback free error recovery method where the sender introduces redundant data in advance with the source data enabling the recipient to recover from different arbitrary packet losses. Recently, the adoption of FEC error control method has been boosted by the introduction of the powerful RaptorQ Application Layer FEC (AL-FEC) codes. In this work we propose the integration of ALFEC error protection application at the edge layer. We propose a novel AL-FEC application architecture scheme based on RaptorQ codes and we analyze the performance enhancements such an error control architecture can introduce on Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN)-edge computing integrated systems.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {364-369},\n  author = {Bouras, Christos and Kanakis, Nikolaos},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WGUJZJF4/Bouras and Kanakis - 2018 - AL-FEC Application on NGMN-Edge Computing Integrat.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783453562,"version":0,"updated":1563899940744},"$loki":986},{"itemID":5911,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{akter_integration_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Integration of {{Contourlet Transform}} and {{Canny Edge Detector}} for {{Brain Image Segmentation}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436695/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436695},\n  abstract = {This paper proposed a new integrated image segmentation method for MRI brain images.

This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  pages = {880-885},\n  author = {Alvear, Oscar and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan-Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3Y6VC32N/Alvear et al_2015_Validation of a vehicle emulation platform supporting OBD-II communications.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783453812,"version":0,"updated":1563899939320},"$loki":988},{"itemID":3978,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_contiki_c,\n  title = {Contiki: {{MQTT}}-and-{{CoAP}}},\n  url = {http://www.cea-iot.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Day-4-Contiki-MQTT-and-CoAP.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-04-19},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/R4E9RSXH/Day-4-Contiki-MQTT-and-CoAP.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783453834,"version":0,"updated":1563899939670},"$loki":989},{"itemID":5653,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{datta_virtual_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Virtual {{Reality Mobile Application Testing}} in a {{5G Testbed}}},\n  abstract = {This paper describes an experiment for a Virtual Reality (VR) mobile application testing in a 5G testbed.

At the same time, in order to improve the system performance further, an interleaving method in combination with a LDPC code is used to overcome the burst error problem, which frequently occurs in optical satellite communication systems (OSC). Simulation results show that 970 consecutive burst error bits can be recovered by using a large size LDPC code and the proposed type of interleaving.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {575-579},\n  author = {Nguyen, Duy Thong and Park, Youngil},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6AD42BHX/Nguyen and Park - 2018 - Performance Improvement of Optical Satellite Commu.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783454170,"version":0,"updated":1563899940882},"$loki":994},{"itemID":5820,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{choi_support_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Support for {{Edge Computing}} in the {{5G Network}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436806/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436806},\n  abstract = {Networks beyond 2020 are required to support diverse use cases.

It can help or provide packet forwarding and other network functions. With the development of Internet and the emergence of software-defined networking (SDN), the methods designed for the traditional 5-dimensional rule set is not sufficient to process the current rule set that contains rules of 12 or more dimensions. The main problem is to process the rule sets of 12 or more dimensions in high throughput. To achieve high throughput, we study the implementations on GPU where some use a single hash table and others use Binary Range Tree to process the searching. In 12dimensional rule sets defined by OpenFlow 1.0, 8 fields are in the format of exact value or wildcard, and so using the single hash table or binary range tree is not efficient. Another problem to implement packet classification on GPU is that we must transfer the input data and results via the PCI-E bus that will incur long bus latency. In this paper, we propose a modified hash table to process the fields that contain only exact value or wildcard, and use the compressing method to reduce memory consumption. On the other hand, we implement the proposed method on APU that uses Heterogeneous System Architecture to skip the bus latency. According to the experimental results on AMD A107850 APU, our method can achieve the throughput of 1814 MPPS, and can support the rule sets of more than 12K 12-dimensional rules. The achieved throughput is 10 times of the methods on legacy GPU.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Chang, Yeim-Kuan and Chi, Tung-Yin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/IKSKCVFY/Chang and Chi - Hash-based OpenFlow Packet Classification on Heter.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783454448,"version":0,"updated":1563899940484},"$loki":998},{"itemID":5703,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{li_cache_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {A {{Cache Replacement Strategy Based}} on {{Hierarchical Popularity}} in {{NDN}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436597/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436597},\n  abstract = {NDN(Named Data Networking,NDN)which is one of the next generation network architectures based on named-data, uses in-network caching.

Although WuR exhibits its superiority for light traffic, it is inefficient to handle high traffic load in a network. This paper makes an effort towards improving the performance of WuR under diverse load conditions with a twofold contribution. We first propose three protocols that support variable traffic loads by enabling respectively clear channel assessment (CCA), backoff plus CCA, and adaptive WuC transmissions. These protocols provide various options for achieving reliable data transmission, low latency, and energy efficiency for ultra-low power consumption applications. Then, we develop an analytical framework based on an M/G/1/2 queue to evaluate the performance of these WuR protocols.

Edge switches tag a label onto packet header, and core switches use this label to perform lookup. In this paper, we propose a scheme called Path\\_label switching. In this scheme, core switch only uses one field to perform lookup. In order to reduce the number of rules in edge switches, we encode the output port number of the last hop into MPLS field. We also propose a scheme to minimize the number of rules in fat-tree topology. In our scheme, the number of rules in core and aggregation switches is the same as the number of ports. We use Mininet to construct the experiments.

This aggravates the already over-congested unlicensed radio bands, calling for new mechanisms to improve spectrum management and energy efficiency, such as transmission power control. Existing protocols are based on simplistic heuristics that often approach interference problems (i.e., packet loss, delay and energy waste) by increasing power, leading to detrimental results. The scope of this work is to investigate how machine learning may be used to bring wireless nodes to the lowest possible transmission power level and, in turn, to respect the quality requirements of the overall network. Lowering transmission power has benefits in terms of both energy consumption and interference. We propose a protocol of transmission power control through a reinforcement learning process that we have set in a multi-agent system. The agents are independent learners using the same exploration strategy and reward structure, leading to an overall cooperative network. The simulation results show that the system converges to an equilibrium where each node transmits at the minimum power while respecting high packet reception ratio constraints. Consequently, the system benefits from low energy consumption and packet delay.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2018-01-27},\n  pages = {375},\n  author = {Chincoli, Michele and Liotta, Antonio},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/G6JTECZ2/Chincoli and Liotta - 2018 - Self-Learning Power Control in Wireless Sensor Net.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783455024,"version":0,"updated":1563899939778},"$loki":1006},{"itemID":5585,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{takahashi_overloaded_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Overloaded {{Wireless MIMO Switching}} for {{Secure Wireless Communication Exchanging}} to {{Untrusted Relay}}},\n  abstract = {Wireless MIMO Switch makes the information exchange among terminals by two time steps.

In the proposed wireless MIMO switch, the stations whose number is the number of antennas plus one access the relay. As a result, the relay station hardly decodes each information owing to the overloaded access. In each station, firstly, one information signal is decoded by the interference cancellation of its own signal and the zero forcing of relay filter. Since one information signal is shared to all the stations, each station can demodulate the information because the overloaded condition is mitigated by the shared information signal.

However, since there is a limit in the frequency resource, it has become very important to improve the spectral efficiency. In-Band Full Duplex (IBFD) systems can improve spectral efficiency up to 2 times. In this IBFD system, the Self-Interference (SI) occurs inherently, so the desired received signal cannot be demodulated. SelfInterference Cancellation (SIC) must be required to solve this problem.

Considering this existing gap in the Internet of Things (IoT) area, this paper proposes a mechanism for discovering, connecting, and identifying heterogeneous Bluetooth-enabled IoT devices of unknown device type, in order to be integrated into different platforms. This mechanism implements three (3) stages to successfully identify an unknown device. Initially, the discovery and the connection of both known and unknown devices take place so as to retrieve explicitly required specifications of these devices. Sequentially, the measurement of the syntactic similarity of all the devices' specifications and the comparison among the derived results occurs. Based on these results, the estimation of the overall syntactic similarity takes place, identifying finally the device type of the connected unknown devices. The prototype associated with this paper provides an example of this mechanism, demonstrating in detail each stage.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Mavrogiorgou, Argyro and Kiourtis, Athanasios and Touloupou, Marios and Kyriazis, Dimosthenis},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HGKYKZZK/Mavrogiorgou et al. - Identification of Bluetooth-Enabled IoT Devices Th.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783455918,"version":0,"updated":1563899940442},"$loki":1018},{"itemID":5759,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{choi_novel_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Novel {{Query Tree Algorithm Based}} on {{Reservation}} and {{Time}}-{{Divided Responses}} to {{Support Efficient Anti}}-{{Collision Protocol}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436700/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436700},\n  abstract = {To support IoT ecosystem, the closest technology to date is RFID sensor networks.

Second, we validate such findings using commercial devices, confirming our numerical results. Third, we modified and extended LoRaSim, an open-source LoRa simulator, to measure the impact of inter-SF collisions and fading (which was not taken into account previously in the simulator). Our results show that non-orthogonality of the SFs can deteriorate significantly the performance especially of higher SFs (10 to 12) and that fading has virtually no impact when multiple gateways are available in space diversity.},\n  booktitle = {Digital {{Communication}}. {{Towards}} a {{Smart}} and {{Secure Future Internet}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-18},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {165-179},\n  keywords = {SF},\n  author = {Croce, Daniele and Gucciardo, Michele and Tinnirello, Ilenia and Garlisi, Domenico and Mangione, Stefano},\n  editor = {Piva, Alessandro and Tinnirello, Ilenia and Morosi, Simone},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/AMP8L7Z5/Croce et al. - 2017 - Impact of Spreading Factor Imperfect Orthogonality.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783456788,"version":0,"updated":1563899939920},"$loki":1028},{"itemID":5594,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{wang_socialaware_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Social-{{Aware Routing}} for {{Multi}}-Hop {{D2D Communication}} in {{Relay Cellular Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a promising technology for 5G mobile communication networks due to several benefits such as highly increased spectral efficiency, extended coverage, reduced latency, and enhanced cost and power efficiency.

In this paper, a socialaware routing algorithm is proposed to design the multi-hop path in the cellular network. Based on the Friis transmission equation, we drive the received power distribution and construct a relay cellular network. In addition, the congested ratio and average congested intensity are important indices to measure network congestion. To investigate the impact of network congestion on the end-to-end delay, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in three different congested ratio networks. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm in terms of reducing the end-to-end delay.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Wang, Sai and Shin, Oh-Soon and Shin, Yoan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/JAI4N82F/Wang et al. - Social-Aware Routing for Multi-hop D2D Communicati.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783456814,"version":0,"updated":1563899940430},"$loki":1029},{"itemID":5735,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{min_improved_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {An {{Improved Mobility Support Mechanism}} for {{Downward Traffic}} in {{RPL}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436982/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436982},\n  abstract = {With the diversification of industrial IoT applications, there is a growing demand for mobility support in industrial wireless network environments such as smart grid and smart factory.

Currently, Li-Fi is emerged as highly promising as it supports high data rate and security. But it suffers from some limitations, e.g., short communication distance, low signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) etc. OCC can overcome these limitations, but it only supports lower data rate. Therefore, to provide proper solution, we propose a hybrid OCC/Li-Fi system.

The existing OFDM scheme that maps symbols to subcarriers using an inverse fast Fourier transform (iFFT) operation uses a cyclic prefix (CP) to reduce inter-symbol interference in a multipath channel, which is a disadvantage of power and spectral efficiency respectively. Therefore, this paper aims to complement the existing shortcomings for next generation high-speed communication and to design more efficient MCM system. The proposed system uses IDWT (inverse discrete wavelet transform) operation instead of iFFT operation used in conventional OFDM. A wavelet transform is an operation that filters a signal using wavelet and scaling basis functions. Therefore, we compared the bit error rate (BER), spectral efficiency, and peak to average power ratio (PAPR) performance with the conventional OFDM system through the design of OFDM system based on wavelet transform. As a result, the conventional OFDM and wavelet-OFDM exhibited the same BER performance, and wavelet-OFDM using the Discrete Meyer wavelet had the same spectral efficiency as the conventional OFDM. In addition, all systems of wavelet-OFDM based on various wavelets confirm PAPR performance lower than conventional OFDM.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {881-885},\n  author = {Lee, Jun-Gu and Ryu, Heung-Gyoon},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/THUQ35MI/Lee and Ryu - 2018 - Design and Comparison of Discrete Wavelet Transfor.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783458124,"version":0,"updated":1563899941128},"$loki":1043},{"itemID":3086,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{al-fuqaha_internet_24,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Internet of {{Things}}: {{A Survey}} on {{Enabling Technologies}}, {{Protocols}}, and {{Applications}}},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {1553-877X, 2373-745X},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7123563/},\n  doi = {10.1109/COMST.2015.2444095},\n  shorttitle = {Internet of {{Things}}},\n  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols, and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

To eliminate this aspect, requirements for a distributed NFV orchestration are defined. The requirements are categorized into architectural and orchestration specific aspects and are derived from the characteristics of a WMN and the conditions of a disaster environment.

Use of CCN in wireless environment can cause various issues such as re-transmissions, collisions, delay and link failure. One of the key issues that affects the performance of CCN is the management of Pending Interest Table (PIT). PIT stores each broadcasted Interest packet forwarded upstream towards the content provider and is purged either when the requested content is returned or the PIT Entry Lifetime (PEL) expires. The conventional method in CCN for PEL does not considering the network impairments such as channel error, and congestion. As a result, timeout occurs, and Interest packets are re-transmitted for the chunks that have been dropped or delayed. Due to limited size of storage in wireless CCN, all new incoming Interest packets (including retransmissions) affect the performance of network by bloating PIT. In this paper, therefore, we propose a scheme that purges the PIT entries quickly by prefetching the un-obtained content in advance.

Simulation results reveal that our proposed solution can achieve low latency and high throughput compared to the static network slice approach.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {625-629},\n  author = {Kyung Lee, Min and Seon Hong, Choong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/5EXNYYCC/Kyung Lee and Seon Hong - 2018 - Efficient Slice Allocation for Novel 5G Services.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":612,"created":1563783459474,"version":0,"updated":1563899940920},"$loki":1057},{"itemID":5925,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_hypercache_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {{{hyperCache}}: {{A Hypervisor}}-{{Level Virtualized I}}/{{O Cache}} on {{KVM}}/{{QEMU}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436697/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436697},\n  shorttitle = {{{hyperCache}}},\n  abstract = {While VDI offers several benefits, such as the increased resource utilization and the private data protection, there exist problems that can deteriorate the system performance, including I/O virtualization overhead.

Although ICN has various types, the method for content management is similar to each other. The core concept of ICN has been developed based on the content name instead of the content location information, intermediate content caching between the sender and the receiver, packet level security and others. To achieve the objective of ICN, different architectures were proposed and analyzed based on the criteria of ICN, however there are still remaining issues to be resolved. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based content management framework for ICN which enables content registration, distribution, retrieval, caching, routing, and security support.

This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance. Last, the application parameters required by the smart energy scenario influence LoRa performance, but their impacts have been scarcely reported. Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Petri Nets}} 1989},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {1990},\n  pages = {1-29},\n  author = {Marsan, M.

In this case, since the visible light communication system generally uses intensity modulation, when a plurality of LEDs transmit data at the same time, it is difficult to accurately detect the respective LEDs due to the light scattering interference of the adjacent LEDs. In order to solve these problems, we propose spectral estimation technique and pixel image signal processing technique for each LED. A threshold value is generated based on the center value of the spectrum at the center of each LED, and only the LED which is sensed above the reference value is recognized independently by the ISP. If the spectral level is below the center value, that LED is recognized as off because it is affected by the light spread of adjacent LEDs. This technique accurately recognizes multiple LED pixels and improves the total average bit error rate and throughput of the MISOOCVLC (Optical Camera Visible Light Communication) system.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {765-767},\n  author = {Han, Doohee and Lee, Kyujin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/56YUL4N3/Han and Lee - 2018 - Optical Spectrum Estimation Technique for Optical .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":612,"created":1563783462204,"version":0,"updated":1563899941068},"$loki":1091},{"itemID":3761,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{rafikzitouni_lab1_,\n  title = {Lab1.Pdf},\n  author = {Rafik Zitouni},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/N7INS8KR/Lab1.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":612,"created":1563783462394,"version":0,"updated":1563899939484},"$loki":1092},{"itemID":4816,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{hamza_what_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {1. {{What}} Is {{Purple IoT}} ? 2. {{Architecture}} 3. {{Exploring Purple IoT}} 4. {{Concepts}} 5. {{Used Technologies}}},\n  pages = {20},\n  author = {Hamza, Jeljeli},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/Y95ILZ3R/Hamza - 1.

A lot of recent works have proved that an approach of caching at edge devices is efficient to reduce latency and alleviate backhaul load so that the probability to meet users' Quality of Service (QoS) is much higher. However, due to the selfishness of mobile users, it is hard to convince users to store contents for other users. In this regard, we consider the social connection between users in order to induce users to store contents for the social community. So, to implement the socially aware Device to Device (D2D) caching, we construct two types of graphs: i) physical D2D graph which is constructed based on users communication over D2D links and ii) logical social graph which is consist of a group of people who share the common interest. Then, we formulate socially aware D2D caching problem into Markov Decision Process (MDP). Additionally, we consider the distance and the social ties between users, and mobile devices' capacity to optimally store contents under the constraint that energy consumption of cellular link is much higher than D2D link. Finally, we solve the D2D caching problem by using Q-learning where the goal is to minimize the total energy consumption over Macrocell Base Station (MBS) and mobile devices.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Im, Han Yeo Reum and Thar, Kyi and Hong, Choong Seon},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/5BND8GHA/Im et al. - Q-Learning Based Social Community-Aware Energy Eff.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":612,"created":1563783462442,"version":0,"updated":1563899940844},"$loki":1095},{"itemID":4512,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{toyooka_evaluation_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Evaluation of {{Real}}-Time Property in {{Embedded Linux}}},\n  date = {2014},\n  pages = {37},\n  author = {Toyooka, Hiraku},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/4GP4KR8G/Toyooka - Evaluation of Real-time property in Embedded Linux.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":612,"created":1563783462726,"version":0,"updated":1563899939958},"$loki":1097},{"itemID":4836,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@collection{krendzel_wireless_2012,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Wireless {{Mesh Networks}} - {{Efficient Link Scheduling}}, {{Channel Assignment}} and {{Network Planning Strategies}}},\n  isbn = {978-953-51-0672-2},\n  url = {http://www.intechopen.com/books/wireless-mesh-networks-efficient-link-scheduling-channel-assignment-and-network-planning-strategies},\n  publisher = InTech,\n  urldate = {2019-06-15},\n  date = {2012-08-14},\n  editor = {Krendzel, Andrey},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/8RCRWN5T/Krendzel - 2012 - Wireless Mesh Networks - Efficient Link Scheduling.pdf},\n  doi = {10.5772/2612},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":612,"created":1563783462740,"version":0,"updated":1563899940168},"$loki":1098},{"itemID":5913,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{mathur_throughput_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Throughput {{Improvement}} by {{Using Dynamic Channel Selection}} in 2.{{4GHz Band}} of {{IEEE}} 802.11 {{WLAN}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436954/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436954},\n  abstract = {IEEE 802.11 WLAN Access Points(APs) are configured in the 2.4GHz band extensively to cater for the needs of all WiFi-enabled devices.

Our proposed Dynamic Channel Selection(DCS) algorithm selects the optimal channel based on the periodic scan of the environment by a co-located monitoring radio unit. Frequent switching of channels is also reduced to maintain the AP's performance and stability.

Massive network infrastructures could not assure users perceived network and service quality, which is an indisputable fact. To address this issue, we design a new framework for heterogeneous wireless networks with the principle of user-centricity, refactoring the network from users' perspective to suffice their requirements and preferences. Different from network-centric approaches, the proposed framework takes advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and virtualization technology, which will bring better perceived services quality for wireless network users. In the proposed user-centric framework, control plane and data plane are decoupled to manage the HetNets in a flexible and coadjutant way, and resource virtualization technology is introduced to abstract physical resources of HetNets into unified virtualized resources. Hence, ubiquitous and undifferentiated network connectivity and QoE (quality of experience) driven fine-grained resource management could be achieved for wireless network users.},\n  journaltitle = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  keywords = {BW},\n  author = {Lu, Zhaoming and Lei, Tao and Wen, Xiangming and Wang, Luhan and Chen, Xin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6NQXK2A6/Lu et al_2016_SDN Based User-Centric Framework for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00004}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":612,"created":1563783463000,"version":0,"updated":1563899939906},"$loki":1101},{"itemID":5876,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{jin_digital_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Digital {{Watermarking Using Group Quantization}} for {{CityGML Objects}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a watermarking method using group quantization for CityGML.

A third party network can be a community network managed by its users, a Wi-Fi mesh network or a licensed band femtocell. Recently, many studies have emerged related to mobile data offloading.

It is quite complex problem to solve the spectrum fragmentation. Fuzzy logic system that resembles human inference has been used for decision making for complex problem. In this paper, we propose the dynamic spectrum assignment (SA) algorithm for minimizing the fragmentation based on the fuzzy logic in EONs. To design fuzzy logic control system for the SA algorithm, we define spectrum fragmentation ratio(SFR) and time fragmentation ratio(TFR) for input membership. We also define the weight values of available spectrum blocks as output membership. The spectrum block with the minimum crisp value is selected for the spectrum assignment of connection request.

Similarly, NDN provides an alternative to traditional host centric IP architecture which seems a perfect candidate for distributed computation. Although NDN with EC seems a promising approach for enabling future Internet, it can cause various challenges such as expiry time of the Pending Interest Table (PIT) and non-trivial computation of the edge node. In this paper we discuss the expiry time and non-trivial computation in NDN based EC. We argue that if NDN is integrated in EC, then the PIT expiry time will be affected in relation with the processing time on the edge node. Our analysis shows that integrating NDN in EC without considering PIT expiry time may result in the degradation of network performance in terms of Interest Satisfaction Rate.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Ullah, Rehmat and Rehman, Muhammad Atif Ur and Kim, Byung-Seo and Sonkoly, Balazs and Tapolcai, Janos},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/QLT7VWQD/Ullah et al. - On Pending Interest Table in Named Data Networking.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":612,"created":1563783464170,"version":0,"updated":1563899940470},"$loki":1117},{"itemID":5683,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bruni_dynamic_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Dynamic {{DetectinnTracking Switching}}},\n  abstract = {Advances in deep learning based object detection methods have achieve state-of-the-art detection accuracy in real-time using high-end GPUs.

At present, most of the existing sensing schemes are proposed in Gaussian noise. Nevertheless, in practice, CR suffers from non-Gaussian noise such as man-made impulsive noise, ultra-wideband interference and co-channel interference. In this article, to handle the detection performance degradation in non-Gaussian impulsive noise environments, a robust spectrum sensing scheme namely hyperbolic tangent based energy detector (HT-ED) is proposed. The proposed HT-ED is a semi-blind method which does not require any a priori knowledge about the primary user's signals. Furthermore, the HT-ED can provide a superior detection performance compared with the conventional energy detector (ED) in a wide range of non-Gaussian noises. The simulation results show that the proposed HT-ED is very robust against impulsive noises which are modeled as the Laplace or {$\\alpha$}-stable noises. Moreover the detection performance of HT-ED is much better than those of the traditional ED and FLOM-based methods.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {283-288},\n  author = {Qu, Hua and Xu, Xiguang and Zhao, Jihong and Yan, Feiyu and Wang, Weihua},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/FSBLQQKF/Qu et al. - 2018 - Robust Spectrum Sensing Based on Hyperbolic Tangen.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":612,"created":1563783465902,"version":0,"updated":1563899940708},"$loki":1130},{"itemID":5851,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{do_image_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An Image Gradient Based {{LED}} Bit Detection Algorithm in Vehicular Optical Camera Communication},\n  abstract = {Information in vehicular optical camera communication (VOCC) systems is transmitted using LED arrays, which are also vehicle lights functioning both illumination and communication.

Accordingly, the optical communication network for 5G needs to continuously evolve to a high-speed, high-capacity, infrastructure to provide high-quality service. However, due to the limited number of fiber cables, the maximum capacity extension that can be transmitted is limited. To solve this problem, a new optical transport network configuration solution must be studied. Therefore, the adoption of DWDM(Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) scheme, which is most advantageous for increasing the data capacity among the various optical communication network technologies proposed to date, is rapidly increasing.[1] However, because DWDM is advantageous in capacity, but requires a large number of wavelengths, DWDM SFP optical module inventory per channel can accumulate, leading to an increase in inventory costs. In order to solve this problem, we applied wavelength tunable SFP(T-SFP) which can realize more than 16 channels with one SFP module and summarized the results of study on tunable SFP.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Kim, Jongsin and Lim, Jongyoung and Telecom, SK and Gim, Gwangyong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/FND37ILM/Kim et al. - The Study on Tunable-SFP for Optical Transport Net.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783466150,"version":0,"updated":1563899940986},"$loki":1135},{"itemID":5576,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{poulose_localization_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Localization {{Error Analysis}} of {{Indoor Positioning System Based}} on {{UWB Measurements}}},\n  abstract = {Ultra wide band (UWB) systems use time information instead of the popular received signal strength indication (RSSI).

For accurate positioning, VLP requires a signal from more than two transmitters. However, the signal from the minimum number of transmitters may not always be available especially in the area close to the walls leading to inaccurate positioning (the deadzone).

In the considered structure, the secondary base station (SB) can help relay the PS's signal via an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol, and a power splitting EH device is adopted at the PR. A cooperative strategy is proposed for maximizing the efficiency of the information and power transfer. We optimize two precoders at the SB (for the PS and SS, respectively) and the power splitting factor for the PR. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, it is a real challenge. To facilitate the optimization process, a precoding structure is first proposed to reduce the number of parameters.

The test system uses several single board computers (SBC) with an external Wi-Fi adapter (USB), 19 SBCs are sniffing nodes (SFN) and one SBC as sending node (SN). The sniffing SBCs are placed in a cycle around the sender so that every node has the same chance to receive the simulated packets from the SN. For the control of all 20 SBCs, a self-developed software is used, which connects from the host to the clients and is used for configuring the experiments. The configuration is sent to each client and will initiate their start, so that their times are also synchronized, for this all clients are synchronised using a time server.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {358-364},\n  author = {Friess, Kristof},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/DG3CNKCW/Friess - 2018 - Multichannel-Sniffing-System for Real-World Analys.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783467848,"version":0,"updated":1563899940742},"$loki":1156},{"itemID":5752,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_monitoring_2018a,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Monitoring of {{IoT Data}} for {{Reducing Network Traffic}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436601/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436601},\n  abstract = {As IoT systems spread, a huge amount of data is generated from devices in every second.

The IoT vision is to extend the Internet into our everyday lives, so the number of connected devices and innovative applications are growing very fast to bring intelligence into\nas many domains as possible. The QoS for IoT application not only depends on the Internet network and communication\ninfrastructure, it is also impacted by the operation and performance of IoT sensing infrastructure. Therefore, the new QoS parameters such as data accuracy, sampling rate, and\ndevice availability become important for the IoT applications compared to the Internet applications. The huge number of the Internet-connected IoT devices and application, and the spontaneous traffic flow among them make the management of the quality of service complex\nacross the Internet infrastructure. On the other hand, the non-IP devices and their limited capabilities in terms of energy and transmission create the dynamic environment and hinder the direct interaction between devices and applications. The quality of service is becoming one of the critical non-functional IoT element which needs research and studies. A flexible and scalable QoS management mechanism must be implemented in IoT system to keep up with the growth rate of the Internet-connected IoT devices and applications as well as their heterogeneity and diversity. The solution should address the IoT application requirements and user satisfaction while considering the system dynamism, limitations, and characteristics. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networking which separates the control plane and the data plane of the network elements. It makes the network\nelements programmable via the centralized control plane. This approach enables more agile management and control over the network behavior. In this thesis, we take advantage of SDN technology as the future of the Internet to offer a\nflexible and adaptive QoS support scheme for the IoT services. We present an SDN-based middleware to define a QoS management framework to manage the application specific QoS\nneeds across the IoT infrastructure including transport and sensing network. Also, we propose a new QoS model that takes into account the application QoS preferences and the network\nelements status to allocate effectively the resources for the applications across SDN network while maximizing network performance.},\n  institution = {{\\'Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\\'eal}},\n  type = {masters},\n  urldate = {2019-04-11},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  author = {Meshinchi, Atefeh},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/BNHZ9XGG/Meshinchi_2018_QOS-Aware and Status-Aware Adaptive Resource Allocation Framework in SDN-Based.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783468472,"version":0,"updated":1563899939518},"$loki":1164},{"itemID":4727,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{george_reunion_2019,\n  title = {R\\'eunion {{Lancement Atelier}}\\_5\\_{{E3S}}-15 Mai 2019},\n  date = {2019},\n  author = {George, Laurent},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/EQTASLKP/Réunion Lancement Atelier_5_E3S-15 mai 2019 .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783468482,"version":0,"updated":1563899940040},"$loki":1165},{"itemID":5648,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{han_physical_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Physical {{Layer Security Improvement Using Artificial Noise}}-{{Aided Tag Scheduling}} in {{Ambient Backscatter Communication Systems}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an artificial noise-aided tag scheduling (ANTS) scheme in order to enhance physical layer security in ambient backscatter communications (ABCs), which utilize existing radio frequency (RF) signals such as TV, FM radio, Wi-Fi, and so on. In more detail, we first select the best tag based on the channel gain between a tag and a reader and then select another tag for generating artificial noise affecting an eavesdropper. Consequently, we propose a scheduling criterion to choose both information and artificial noise tags. In addition, we apply a successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique at the reader in order to eliminate the interference from the artificial noise tag. The simulation results show that our proposed ANTS scheme can obtain a better secrecy rate as the channel gain between the tag and the receiver increases and the number of tags increases. Moreover, when the number of tags is sufficiently large, the proposed ANTS scheme significantly outperforms the conventional scheme in terms of average secrecy rate.},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Han, Ji Yoon and Kim, Junsu and Kim, Su Min},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/4JZT3WDR/Han et al. - Physical Layer Security Improvement Using Artiﬁcia.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783468502,"version":0,"updated":1563899940538},"$loki":1166},{"itemID":5689,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_vehicle_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Vehicle {{Color Recognition}} via {{Representative Color Region Extraction}} and {{Convolutional Neural Network}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436710/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436710},\n  abstract = {Vehicle color recognition is one of the important part in ITS (Intelligent Transportation System).

However, the increased connectivity of everyday objects can open manifold security vectors for cybercriminals to perform malicious attacks. These threats are even augmented by the resource constraints and heterogeneity of low-cost IoT devices, which make current host-based and static perimeter-oriented defense mechanisms unsuitable for dynamic IoT environments. Accounting for all these considerations, we reckon that the novel softwarization capabilities of Telco network can fully leverage its privileged position to provide the desired levels of security. To this aim, the emerging software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) paradigms can introduce new security enablers able to increase the level of IoT systems protection. In this paper, we design a novel policy-based framework aiming to exploit SDN/NFV-based security features, by efficiently coupling with existing IoT security approaches. A proof of concept test bed has been developed to assess the feasibility of the proposed architecture. The presented performance evaluation illustrates the benefits of adopting SDN security mechanisms in integrated IoT environments and provides interesting insights in the policy enforcement process to drive future research.},\n  number = {5},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Network Management},\n  shortjournal = {Int.

In emergency situations such as severe traffic accidents, minimizing the response time, which requires close collaborations between all stakeholders involved and distributed intelligence support, leads to greater survival chance of the injured. However, the current response system is far from efficient, despite the rapid development of information and communication technologies. This paper presents an automated collaboration framework for emergency management that coordinates all stakeholders within the emergency response system and fully automates the rescue process. Applying the concept of multiaccess edge computing architecture, as well as choreography of the service oriented architecture, the system allows seamless coordination between multiple organizations in a distributed way through standard web services. A service choreography is designed to globally model the emergency management process from the time an accident occurs until the rescue is finished. The choreography can be synthesized to generate detailed specification on peer-to-peer interaction logic, and then the specification can be enacted and deployed on cloud infrastructures.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {1-13},\n  author = {Chen, Lei and Englund, Cristofer},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XUFTNMVT/Chen_Englund_2018_Every Second Counts.pdf},\n  note = {00007}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783469716,"version":0,"updated":1563899939852},"$loki":1173},{"itemID":4550,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{saravanan_smart_2017,\n  location = {{Geneva, Switzerland}},\n  title = {Smart Water Grid Management Using {{LPWAN IoT}} Technology},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-5873-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8016224/},\n  doi = {10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016224},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{Global Internet}} of {{Things Summit}} ({{GIoTS}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{Global Internet}} of {{Things Summit}} ({{GIoTS}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Saravanan, M and Das, Arindam and Iyer, Vishakh},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WVEPTR7C/Saravanan et al_2017_Smart water grid management using LPWAN IoT technology.pdf},\n  note = {00013}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783469738,"version":0,"updated":1563899939976},"$loki":1174},{"itemID":4700,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_endtoend_,\n  title = {End-to-{{End Open Source IoT}} with {{RIOT}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6XI24WR5/ADJIH.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783470108,"version":0,"updated":1563899940036},"$loki":1177},{"itemID":4756,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_esiee_,\n  title = {{{ESIEE}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/EA2V542Z/Présentation24_light.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783470124,"version":0,"updated":1563899940118},"$loki":1178},{"itemID":5067,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@book{nilsson_evaluation_2018,\n  title = {Evaluation of {{Secure Long Distance Communication}} in {{Non}}-{{Urban Environments}}},\n  date = {2018},\n  author = {Nilsson, Daniel},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/NV5E49LM/Nilsson -

Unlike other protocols, the WUR-MAC takes advantage of the WUR ultra-low power listening mode leaving it permanently active to wait for incoming requests. Due to the ultra low power nature of these radio receivers, energy consumption and latency can be optimized at the same time. Energy consumption of the combined physical and MAC layer of a WUR based design is compared to efficient schedule based low power MAC protocols using the same main underlying transceiver without a wakeup radio receiver. WUR-MAC is based on proven MAC concepts but avoids complicated algorithms that are needed to synchronize nodes in traditional WSNs. Simulation results show that with typically low traffic, the average power consumption of schedule-based MACs is significantly higher than by using WUR-MAC only in the case where very low power Wakeup Receivers ({$<$}40 {$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}W always on) are used.

However, the limited bandwidth available for physical layer modulation in LoRa makes it unsuitable for high bit rate data transfer from devices like image sensors. In this paper, we propose a new method for mangrove forest monitoring in Malaysia, wherein we transfer image sensor data over the LoRa physical layer (PHY) in a node-to-node network model. In implementing this method, we produce a novel scheme for overcoming the bandwidth limitation of LoRa. With this scheme the images, which requires high data rate to transfer, collected by the sensor are encrypted as hexadecimal data and then split into packets for transfer via the LoRa physical layer (PHY). To assess the quality of images transferred using this scheme, we measured the packet loss rate, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) index of each image. These measurements verify the proposed scheme for image transmission, and support the industrial and academic trend which promotes LoRa as the future solution for IoT infrastructure.},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-07-02},\n  date = {2018-09-27},\n  pages = {3257},\n  author = {Jebril, Akram and Sali, Aduwati and Ismail, Alyani and Rasid, Mohd},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/GTVNDLS8/Jebril et al_2018_Overcoming Limitations of LoRa Physical Layer in Image Transmission.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783470494,"version":0,"updated":1563899940254},"$loki":1183},{"itemID":3283,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{alvear_ecosensor_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Coimbra, Portugal}},\n  title = {{{EcoSensor}}: {{Monitoring}} Environmental Pollution Using Mobile Sensors},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-2185-7},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7523519/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WoWMoM.2016.7523519},\n  shorttitle = {{{EcoSensor}}},\n  abstract = {Air pollution monitoring has become an essential requirement for cities worldwide.

It is deployed with off-the-shelf hardware such as Waspmote (based on the Arduino platform), low-end sensors, and Raspberry Pi devices.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Symposium}} on \"{{A World}} of {{Wireless}}, {{Mobile}} and {{Multimedia Networks}}\" ({{WoWMoM}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Symposium}} on {{A World}} of {{Wireless}}, {{Mobile}} and {{Multimedia Networks}} ({{WoWMoM}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016-06},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Alvear, Oscar and Zamora, Willian and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan-Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/UETI5DC4/Alvear et al_2016_EcoSensor.pdf},\n  note = {00012}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783470750,"version":0,"updated":1563899939304},"$loki":1184},{"itemID":3762,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{rafikzitouni_lab2_,\n  title = {Lab2.Pdf},\n  author = {Rafik Zitouni},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/NUMA3V28/Lab2.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783470760,"version":0,"updated":1563899939486},"$loki":1185},{"itemID":3911,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{linan_contiki_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Contiki: Sensors and Actuators},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {57},\n  author = {Li\\~n\\'an, Antonio},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/DT5FTGH9/Liñán - Contiki sensors and actuators.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783470780,"version":0,"updated":1563899939644},"$loki":1186},{"itemID":5562,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{nakazato_revenue_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Revenue {{Model}} with {{Multi}}-{{Access Edge Computing}} for {{Cellular Network Architecture}}},\n  abstract = {Due to the drastic growth in the number of devices connected to mobile networks, the demand for further expansion of the capacity of wireless communication is increasing.

The conventional cloud applications are deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) according to the application requirements and data traffic situations, and the users are controlled with out-ofband C-plane to connect to the surrounding MEC applications.

In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage).

Duty cycling, however, does not eliminate idle listening, comes at the price of longer latencies and obtains lifetimes that are still insufficient for many critical applications. Using a wake-up receiver (WUR) allows actual communications on the main radio only for transmission or reception, virtually eliminating node idling. However, the range of current WUR prototypes is still significantly shorter than that of the main radio, which can challenge the use of existing WSN protocols in WUR-based networks. In this paper we present an approach to mitigate this limitation of wake-up-based networks. In particular, we show that the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP), a standard protocol for data gathering in WSNs, suitably redefined to work on WUR-endowed nodes, achieves lifetimes of several decades. This constitutes a remarkable improvement over duty cycle-based solutions, where CTP makes the network lasts only a handful of months. At the same time, our WUR-based approach obtains data latencies comparable to those obtained by keeping the main radio always on.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2016-02},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Basagni, Stefano and Petrioli, Chiara and Spenza, Dora},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/GP7HG8CE/Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XM6RSEUR/Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783473666,"version":0,"updated":1563899940204},"$loki":1221},{"itemID":5756,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{mercan_cloud_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Cloud {{Assisted Overlay Routing}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436951/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436951},\n  abstract = {Delay is a crucial factor on the Internet especially for real-time multimedia and interactive applications like videoconferencing, gaming.

Lately, face recognition has begun to be used for security applications at specific locations as well as for authentication.

Consequently, the success rate for face recognition is low for lowresolution cameras. To address this problem, this study proposes a face recognition method in a multi-camera environment that includes both a fixed and a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera.

In this paper, we propose an urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and hidden Markov models (HMM). Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac\\- curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth\\- ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip\\- tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experiments for pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification are con\\- ducted independently and both methods achieve nearly 90\\% on classification.},\n  eventtitle = {2012 15th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}} - ({{ITSC}} 2012)},\n  booktitle = {2012 15th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2012-09},\n  pages = {67-72},\n  author = {Takahashi, Toshimitsu and Kim, HyungKwan and Kamijo, Shunsuke},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/M5JU9NJ4/Takahashi et al_2012_Urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and HMM.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783475260,"version":0,"updated":1563899939336},"$loki":1240},{"itemID":3909,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{zikria_iot_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{IoT THEORETICAL TO PRACTICAL}}: {{CONTIKI}}-{{OS AND ZOLERTIA REMOTE}}},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {09737006},\n  url = {http://www.pphmj.com/abstract/10939.htm},\n  doi = {10.17654/EC017040915},\n  shorttitle = {{{IoT THEORETICAL TO PRACTICAL}}},\n  abstract = {Things constitute of all the networked devices that can communicate with each other.

We suggest that nodes use light-weight learning methods, namely, multi-armed bandit algorithms, to select the communication parameters (spreading factor and emission power).

Accordingly, there are growing needs for UAS Traffic Management (UTM) systems. In this phenomenon, various communication protocols for UTM are emerging. In this paper, especially, the application of UTM system based on Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) protocol is introduced as one of most efficient and stable protocols in environments with high-speed mobility and dynamic changing topology.

As a efficient way to cope with various attacks, the Random Forest(RF) algorithm has frequently been used as the core engine of intrusion detection because of the faster learning speed and the higher attack detection accuracy. However, the RF algorithm has to input the number of the tree composing the forest as a parameter. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm that limit the number of trees composing the forest using the McNemar test. To evaluate the performance of the proposed RF algorithm, we compared learning time, accuracy and memory usage of the proposed algorithm with the original RF algorithm and other algorithm by using the KDDcup99 dataset. Under the same detection accuracy, the proposed RF algorithm improves the performance of the original RF algorithm by as much as 97.76\\% at learning time, 91.86\\% at test time, and 99.02\\% in memory usage on average.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {305-307},\n  author = {Choi, Seok-Hwan and Ko, DongHyun and Hwang, SeonJin and Choi, Yoon-Ho},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3ZLML7II/Choi et al. - 2018 - Memory-Efficient Random Forest Generation Method f.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783476296,"version":0,"updated":1563899940718},"$loki":1254},{"itemID":5939,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{bae_automated_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {An {{Automated System Recovery Using BlockChain}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437040/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437040},\n  abstract = {The existing Disaster Recovery(DR) system has a technique for integrity of the duplicated file to be used for recovery, but it could not be used if the file was changed.

Urban planners are looking for solutions to reduce traffic congestion. Realtime traffic information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and traffic control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}} ({{IMIS}})},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-06},\n  pages = {450-455},\n  author = {Kim, Wooseong and Gerla, Mario},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/U28YNY9U/Kim_Gerla_2011_NAVOPT.pdf},\n  note = {00022}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783476640,"version":0,"updated":1563899939344},"$loki":1256},{"itemID":4829,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{karmakar_linkcon_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Chennai, India}},\n  title = {*{{Linkcon}}: {{Adaptive Link Configuration}} over {{SDN Controlled Wireless Access Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-5051-8},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3083181.3083184},\n  doi = {10.1145/3083181.3083184},\n  shorttitle = {Linkcon},\n  eventtitle = {The {{ACM Workshop}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the {{ACM Workshop}} on {{Distributed Information Processing}} in {{Wireless Networks}}  - {{DIPWN}}'17},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-06-15},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Karmakar, Raja and Chattopadhyay, Samiran and Chakraborty, Sandip},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/QN8Y27W6/Karmakar et al_2017_Linkcon.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783476676,"version":0,"updated":1563899940164},"$loki":1257},{"itemID":5805,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kwon_study_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Study}} on {{Verification System}} to {{Support Efficient Interface Test}} in {{Embedded System}}},\n  abstract = {In recent years, embedded systems such as various electronic devices equipped with a microprocessor, which acts as a brain of electronic devices, have been spreading due to the improvement of computational capability of system semiconductors and the generalization of large-capacity memory.

The big data transmitted to the cloud or fog will consume massive network bandwidth. This may result in the IoT network easily encountering network congestion. Moreover, there are IoT applications that need to transfer multimedia data with multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements. A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed. The AQRA improves the average end-to-end flow performance by 10.75\\%, 11.88\\% and 10.82\\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively.

A vehicle driving on the ramp generally attempts to enter the highway without predicting the traffic condition, and commonly causes traffic congestion on highways. Traffic congestion in the highway junction is defined as the traffic situation that the transport demand in the conjunction point exceeds the bottleneck capacity and the accumulated demand remains to the bottleneck. Under traffic congestion, vehicles driving on the ramp cannot efficiently enter the highway. As a result, the waiting time of the vehicle on the ramp becomes long, and fuel consumption and CO2 emission increase due to the frequent acceleration and deceleration. In this paper, we propose a vehicular speed acceleration advisory algorithm for the vehicle on the ramp at the junction point. By recognizing the traffic condition on highways using V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication, the proposed algorithm helps to reduce the frequent acceleration and deceleration by drivers. From the simulation results, compared to the conventional driving on the ramp, we show that the proposed algorithm can decrease fuel consumption, CO2 emission under various vehicle densities.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {85-88},\n  author = {Yun, Kwang-Wook and Kim, Hyeong-Geon and Kwon, Joonho and Jeong, Han-You and Choi, Yoon-Ho},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/VWPDMM55/Yun et al. - 2018 - Vehicular Acceleration Advisory Algorithm Using V2.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783477034,"version":0,"updated":1563899940628},"$loki":1262},{"itemID":5781,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{rahman_localization_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Localization of {{Submerged Sensors}} with a {{Single Beacon}} for {{Non}}-{{Parallel Planes State}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437041/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437041},\n  abstract = {This paper delineates a new method of determining the coordinates of sensors with a single beacon for both the parallel and non-parallel state situations.

The proposed mathematical model of coordinate-determination has better immunity from multipath fading and linearization process of non-linear equations, resulting in more precise location of the sensors.

The massive deployment of such devices may overwhelm the cellular network by imposing strong constraints on the Radio Access Network (RAN) because of the radio resources' scarcity. As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would efficiently help to overcome the risk of congestion. In this paper, we proposed a novel fluid model for M2M communications, which allows gaining an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of such systems. The provided analysis of the model was used to devise a new method to estimate accurately the number of M2M devices willing to connect as well as the number of random access attempts.We proposed, then, a novel implementation of the ACB process, which dynamically computes the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions while includes a corrective action adapting the controller action based on the mismatch existing between the computed and the targeted mean load. Compared to existing approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms allow improving considerably the estimation of the number of M2M devices' arrivals, while outperforming existing techniques in terms of the number of abandons, the success and the collision probabilities, and the average access delay.},\n  eventtitle = {The 19th {{ACM International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 19th {{ACM International Conference}} on {{Modeling}}, {{Analysis}} and {{Simulation}} of {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Systems}} - {{MSWiM}} '16},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {287-291},\n  author = {Bouzouita, Meriam and Hadjadj-Aoul, Yassine and Zangar Tunisia, Nawel and Rubino, Gerardo and Tabbane, Sami},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W7VBDTD4/Bouzouita et al_2016_Dynamic Adaptive Access Barring Scheme For Heavily Congested M2M Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783477626,"version":0,"updated":1563899939468},"$loki":1268},{"itemID":4067,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_evaluation_,\n  title = {\\'Evaluation et Am\\'elioration Des Plates-Formes Logicielles Pour R\\'eseaux de Capteurs sans-Fil, Pour Optimiser La Qualit\\'e de Service et l'\\'energie},\n  url = {http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2016_0051_ROUSSEL.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-04-17},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/N8LVHV5W/DDOC_T_2016_0051_ROUSSEL.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783477640,"version":0,"updated":1563899939742},"$loki":1269},{"itemID":4754,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_interoperability_b,\n  title = {Interoperability on the {{Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/Z4QVJDT4/pilgrimbeart1248-ifm7nov2013-131107105002-phpapp01.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783477652,"version":0,"updated":1563899940114},"$loki":1270},{"itemID":5819,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_low_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Low {{Complexity Beam Searching Algorithm Using Asymptotic Property}} of {{Massive MIMO Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436659/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436659},\n  abstract = {This paper considers a low complexity codebookbased beam searching algorithm for massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems in limited scattering environments.

This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion. One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances. Thus, we proposed, in this paper, a new method to estimate accurately the number of random access attempts in a way to measure efficiently the congestion level. Then, we proposed a novel implementation of the ACB process that mainly consists of dynamically adapting the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions by improving significantly the access's success probability while minimizing radio resources' underutilization.

One of the most difficult challenges to support M2M communications is their huge number compared to available radio resources. Hence, to deal with random access channel (RACH) overload and to better control the access in LTE-A Networks, the 3GPP proposed the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor concept. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve this method based on adaptive multiple ACB factors, according to M2M traffic category with respect to their access delay budget and drop rate (QoS parameters). Simulations were done for testing the effectiveness of our MACB scheme and show that using multiples ACB factors and dynamically adjusting them to the congestion level in addition to traffic type category increases the access probability and reduces overload. The obtained results were then compared to the basic ACB method and show that the access probability increases especially for high priority traffic.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016-01},\n  pages = {693-698},\n  author = {Zangar, Nawel and Gharbi, Sami and Abdennebi, Marwen},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/QPWEPI5R/Zangar et al_2016_Service differentiation strategy based on MACB factor for M2M Communications in.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783478558,"version":0,"updated":1563899939474},"$loki":1281},{"itemID":5761,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{virdaus_performance_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Performance {{Analysis}} of {{Hybrid}}-{{Based Packet Forwarding}} in {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436677/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436677},\n  abstract = {In Wireless Sensor Networks, preserving energy is very important to prolong the sensor node's life. Duty cycle mechanism could preserve the node's energy by providing active and sleep period. However, the uncontrolled duty cycle may affect the delivery rate due to its inconsistency of relay participation in multi-hop packet forwarding. We have observed the effect of duty cycle mechanism to deliver data with a broadcast flooding; which we know that flooding is a fundamental network service for disseminating data. From our observation, controlling a contention window size based on node's density takes an important part in reducing packet collision that leads to a good packet delivery rate. However, in a congested traffic, controlling contention window size based on node's density is not enough because the incoming packet may be congested in packet buffer which is resulting to a packet dropping. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid-based packet forwarding to increase the reliability of transmission by controlling the number of contention window size based on the node's density and packet buffer information. To preserve the energy of the nodes, we also implemented the probability-based broadcast to suppress the number of unnecessary traffic. We compared our work with broadcast flooding, adaptive contention window size, and distance-based broadcast. From our experiment, Hybridbased packet forwarding achieved the best performance in packet reception rate and can control the unnecessary traffic better than others.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {432-435},\n  author = {Virdaus, Irvanda Kurniadi and Kang, Moonsoo and Lee, Chung Ghiu},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HTMKBXA2/Virdaus et al. - 2018 - Performance Analysis of Hybrid-Based Packet Forwar.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783478620,"version":0,"updated":1563899940772},"$loki":1283},{"itemID":4746,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{brigitte_network_2018,\n  title = {Is the Network a Software like Any Other ?},\n  date = {2018},\n  author = {Brigitte, Brigitte},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TKTSBH9R/DNAC-2018-Brigitte-Cardinael.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783478846,"version":0,"updated":1563899940098},"$loki":1284},{"itemID":4825,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{costanzo_software_2012a,\n  location = {{Darmstadt, Germany}},\n  title = {Software {{Defined Wireless Networks}}: {{Unbridling SDNs}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-4554-5 978-0-7695-4870-8},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6385039/},\n  doi = {10.1109/EWSDN.2012.12},\n  shorttitle = {Software {{Defined Wireless Networks}}},\n  eventtitle = {2012 {{European Workshop}} on {{Software Defined Networking}} ({{EWSDN}})},\n  booktitle = {2012 {{European Workshop}} on {{Software Defined Networking}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-15},\n  date = {2012-10},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Costanzo, Salvatore and Galluccio, Laura and Morabito, Giacomo and Palazzo, Sergio},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TBTNJNK7/Costanzo et al_2012_Software Defined Wireless Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783478922,"version":0,"updated":1563899940158},"$loki":1286},{"itemID":5580,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{peter_vision_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Vision {{And Odometry Based Autonomous Vehicle Lane Changing}}},\n  abstract = {Autonomous driving is an old desire of mankind.

Our WRx features very low power consumption ({$<$} 1.3{$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}W), high sensitivity (up to -55dBm), fast reactivity (wake-up time of 130{$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}s), and selective addressing, a key enabler of new high performance protocols. We then present ALBAWUR, a cross-layer solution for data gathering in sensing systems that redesigns a previous leading protocol, ALBA-R, extending it to exploit the features of our WRx. We evaluate the performance of ALBA-WUR via simulations, showing that the use of the WRx produces remarkable energy savings (up to five orders of magnitude), and achieves lifetimes that are decades longer than those obtained by ALBA-R in sensing systems with duty cycling, while keeping latencies at bay.},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE INFOCOM}} 2015 - {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications}}},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications}} ({{INFOCOM}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2015-04},\n  pages = {522-530},\n  author = {Spenza, Dora and Magno, Michele and Basagni, Stefano and Benini, Luca and Paoli, Mario and Petrioli, Chiara},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6CM74A8X/Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/JLXYXZMT/Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783479790,"version":0,"updated":1563899940192},"$loki":1297},{"itemID":5023,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{hoeller_exploiting_2018,\n  title = {Exploiting {{Time Diversity}} of {{LoRa Networks Through Optimum Message Replication}}},\n  booktitle = {2018 15th {{International Symposium}} on {{Wireless Communication Systems}} ({{ISWCS}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {1--5},\n  author = {Hoeller, Arliones and Souza, Richard Demo and L\\`opez, Onel L.

Given the heavy reliance on sensor data, ensuring their validity is an essential concern in BAS. Several work have explored sensor validation, mostly for the purpose of automatic fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD). However, recent studies show BAS vulnerable to adversarial attacks - an area that has lacked consideration in the early design of BAS. In this work, we propose a sensor correction model, based on deep learning framework, for mitigating against data integrity attacks in BAS. We test our approach on real-world data obtained from a retrofitted air conditioning (AC) control testbed, with injected data simulating different attacker types and number of attacked sensors.

In low traffic condition, the proposed mechanism can reduce the ONU's transmitter active time up to 98\\% while still guaranteeing the QoS requirements.

In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users' complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufficient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great influences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper first defines the SFSD and describes the important influences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  urldate = {2019-04-27},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {39895-39906},\n  author = {Min, Xunyou and Xu, Xiaofei and Liu, Zhizhong and Chu, Dianhui and Wang, Zhongjie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/I8KMID9I/Min et al. - 2018 - An Approach to Resource and QoS-Aware Services Opt.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783482738,"version":0,"updated":1563899939672},"$loki":1325},{"itemID":5606,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{katsumata_i2v_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{I2V Multi}}-{{Hop Broadcast Communication}} by {{TC}}-{{BF Method}}},\n  abstract = {A novel Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) multi-hop broadcast communication technique is proposed.

Providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in such frameworks is highly challenging because of the dynamic and loosely coupled nature of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). A framework called the SPontaneous Information and Resource sharing InfrasTructure (SPIRIT) has been presented before to address the challenges of proximity-aware mobile sensor sharing. SPIRIT allows mobile applications to share sensors as services in an automatic fashion by enabling the service providers and clients to express a variety of QoS specifications. This paper presents a set of mobility-aware QoS mechanisms for enabling the implementation of QoS specifications along the multihop paths between service providers and clients in highly mobile environments. Simulations in small-scale Mobile Ad Hoc Networks show SPIRIT's ability to effectively control and manage traffic flows while maintaining desired QoS.

Existing schemes for iBGP routing include the full-mesh (FM) solution, route reflection (RR) solution and confederation. Optimal prefix routing and route diversity are the main strength of the FM solution. However, it is rarely employed in a large networks due to its poor scalability. The RR scheme solves the scalability challenge at the cost of FM optimality due to Route Reflector's partial view of the network. The concept of Software Defined Networking (SDN) entails decoupling of the control plane from the forwarding plane such that the control plane is logically centralized benefiting from an overall knowledge of the network for decision making. In this work, we propose a solution based on multicasting which employs relay nodes in the iBGP message dissemination. The relay nodes are elected and act as boundaries of multicast groups, relaying and filtering prefixes into other multicast groups. We evaluate the use of single and multiple relay nodes per multicast group. Our solution brings session management scalability and minimization of duplicate prefix announcement through elimination of peer sessions deemed unnecessary.

Most of the times IoT's have to deal with low power and communication disconnection due to the limited memory, processing capability, and power. Few techniques for stringent Quality of Service (QoS) routing in IoT have been proposed despite its great impact on future network.

The proposed algorithm adopts energy-efficient possibilistic routing by using fuzzy inference rules to merge energy aware metrics for choosing the optimal delivery path.

In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Network},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Netw.},\n  date = {2006-05},\n  pages = {41-47},\n  keywords = {SIR},\n  author = {Xu, Wenyuan and Ma, Ke and Trappe, W. and Zhang, Yanyong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SYTFJXL4/Xu et al_2006_Jamming sensor networks.pdf},\n  note = {00565}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783483978,"version":0,"updated":1563899939256},"$loki":1340},{"itemID":3284,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{perera_context_21,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Context {{Aware Computing}} for {{The Internet}} of {{Things}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  volume = {16},\n  issn = {1553-877X},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0982},\n  doi = {10.1109/SURV.2013.042313.00197},\n  shorttitle = {Context {{Aware Computing}} for {{The Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  abstract = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace.

Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT.

In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches.

The concept of a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) sensor network was introduced, built up by lightweight Ultra Low Power (ULP) nodes attached to the back of the animals, transmitting sensor data via long range telemetry over a distance of several kilometers. The network architecture was discussed and suitable transmission schemes meeting the harsh energy and weight restrictions were evaluated.

In this paper, we elaborate the development of a LPWA reception network of telemetry-related base stations, tackling the highly demanding requirements for mobility, energy efficiency and remote maintainability. Both, hardware as well as software components are addressed and their interactions are illustrated. The energetically self-sustaining base stations are equipped with directional and omni-directional antennas in a MIMO-like fashion.

A proactive cache technology, which allocates cache data to MEC servers accessed by mobile terminals in advance, is one of technologies to provide the data in a low latency for the mobile terminals. The technology, however, less considers both of the cache placement in time for handover (HO) of mobile terminals and the increase in the traffic between MEC servers for cache distribution. The increase in the traffic is caused by duplicated routes of cache transfer from a location of content data to cache locations and by cache placements on more MEC servers to improve cache hit rate according to a mobile terminal transition. In this paper, we propose a novel proactive cache system which transfers cache data in time for HO of mobile terminals and reduces the traffic between MEC servers, using a route de-duplicating technique for cache transfer and selective data delivery utilizing the locations of mobile terminals predicted from cellular-radio information. We also propose the system architecture which enables services to utilize cellular-radio information by APIs, and evaluate the system by a simulation of the HO prediction and the estimation of the traffic between MEC servers for transferring caches.

In this article we aim to provide an impartial overview of what are the limitations of such technology, and in a comprehensive manner bring use case examples to show where the limits are.},\n  urldate = {2019-05-05},\n  date = {2016-07-27},\n  keywords = {ToA},\n  author = {Adelantado, Ferran and Vilajosana, Xavier and Tuset-Peiro, Pere and Martinez, Borja and Melia, Joan and Watteyne, Thomas},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/PG7NUVNZ/Adelantado et al. - 2016 - Understanding the limits of LoRaWAN.pdf},\n  note = {00325}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783486672,"version":0,"updated":1563899939750},"$loki":1372},{"itemID":4740,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pujolle_cell_2019j,\n  title = {{{CELL Exam}}},\n  date = {2019},\n  author = {Pujolle},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/I7XAKN4A/annale-cell-examen-reparti-2-2014-2015-en.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783486686,"version":0,"updated":1563899940078},"$loki":1373},{"itemID":4956,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{buettner_xmac_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {X-{{MAC}}: {{A Short PreambSleenMsAoCr NPertowtoocrkosl}} {${_\\ast}$}for {{Duty}}-{{Cycled Wireless}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper we present X-MAC, a low power MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Standard MAC protocols developed for duty-cycled WSNs such as BMAC, which is the default MAC protocol for TinyOS, employ an extended preamble and preamble sampling. While this ``low power listening'' approach is simple, asynchronous, and energy-efficient, the long preamble introduces excess latency at each hop, is suboptimal in terms of energy consumption, and suffers from excess energy consumption at nontarget receivers. X-MAC proposes solutions to each of these problems by employing a shortened preamble approach that retains the advantages of low power listening, namely low power communication, simplicity and a decoupling of transmitter and receiver sleep schedules. We demonstrate through implementation and evaluation in a wireless sensor testbed that X-MAC's shortened preamble approach significantly reduces energy usage at both the transmitter and receiver, reduces per-hop latency, and offers additional advantages such as flexible adaptation to both bursty and periodic sensor data sources.},\n  pages = {14},\n  author = {Buettner, Michael and Yee, Gary V and Anderson, Eric and Han, Richard},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/8AZQMW8U/Buettner et al. - X-MAC A Short PreambSleenMsAoCr NPertowtoocrkosl .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783486708,"version":0,"updated":1563899940240},"$loki":1374},{"itemID":5927,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{moon_design_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Design \\& {{Implementation}} of {{Real}}-{{Time Parallel Image Processing Scheme}} on {{Fire}}-{{Control System}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437022/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437022},\n  abstract = {In this paper, a parallel image-processing method based on OpenMP is proposed for a software application in a firecontrol system(FCS).

Currently, OpenHIE can provide the de facto standard for securing health information systems.

Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modified.

In this work, we present an enhanced LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN MAC protocol is characterized by the restrictive use of the channel, limited by the regulatory authorities to a 1\\% duty cycle per cycle (i.e., 36 s per hour) per node. This regulation penalizes the nodes which require a channel access time greater than the limited duty cycle to occasionally transmit a large amount of data such as video surveillance or access control information in applications like smart school surveillance. However, some other nodes like environment sensors sharing a same LoRaWAN server may send very small amounts of information (e.g. temperature, humidity, ...) and under-use the authorized activity time of 1\\% duty cycle. Hence the idea of implementing an activity time sharing mechanism among nodes that allows devices to borrow additional activity time from a device or set of devices that have completed the transmission of their packets and do not need the remaining time of the corresponding duty cycle. Our work extends and improves the activity time sharing mechanism initially proposed in [1]. Instead of FIFO sharing-time allocation based on a global activity time, which may lead to the starvation of the nodes that are others than that in the head of FIFO line, we propose a new time allocation algorithm based on the classification of the different requests according to their needs in terms of their QoS requirements. It allows to satisfy a larger number of nodes requiring extra time, with less control overheads while ensuring fairness. Our time-sharing algorithm has been implemented and tested on the wasp-mote chip of libelium, showing the performance improvement and its practical usability.},\n  booktitle = {Ad-Hoc, {{Mobile}}, and {{Wireless Networks}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {147-162},\n  author = {Benkahla, Norhane and Tounsi, Hajer and Song, Ye-Qiong and Frikha, Mounir},\n  editor = {Montavont, Nicolas and Papadopoulos, Georgios Z.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/YN2LAJUR/Benkahla et al. - 2018 - Enhanced Dynamic Duty Cycle in LoRaWAN Network.pdf},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-00247-3_15},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783487766,"version":0,"updated":1563899941162},"$loki":1387},{"itemID":4457,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_lowpower_,\n  title = {Low-Power, {{Long}}-Range {{WAN}} for {{IoT}}: A Technology Overview},\n  url = {http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/Paper/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3BE7JT5S/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783488000,"version":0,"updated":1563899939930},"$loki":1388},{"itemID":5584,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{park_structure_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Structure {{Design}} for {{Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management System}}},\n  abstract = {The application of the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) in various fields has been attracting attention, and the development of a service utilizing UAS has been proceeding.

In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a network selection scheme, which is for users that select an optimal network with best comprehensive performance between different types of networks. However, the optimal network may be not the most reasonable one due to compensation of MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making), and the network is called pseudo-optimal network. This paper conducts a performance evaluation of a number of widely used MADM-based methods for network selection that aim to keep the mobile users always best connected anywhere and anytime, where subjective weight and objective weight are all considered. The performance analysis shows that the selection scheme based on MEW (weighted multiplicative method) and combination weight can better avoid accessing pseudo-optimal network for balancing network load and reducing ping-pong effect in comparison with three other MADM solutions.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  author = {Zhou, Jian and Zhu, Can-yan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/INK55447/Zhou_Zhu_2016_Compensatory Analysis and Optimization for MADM for Heterogeneous Wireless.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783488310,"version":0,"updated":1563899939892},"$loki":1394},{"itemID":5625,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{choi_impact_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Impact of {{Imperfect Spectrum Sensing}} on {{Hybrid Backscatter Assisted Cognitive Wireless Powered Radio Networks}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a proper sensing period when the detection probability of determining the state of the primary user (PU) changes in a hybrid harvest-then-transmit (HTT) system according to the sensing period.

As a result, image quality assessment (IQA) methods designed for natural images are not always suitable for screen content images. However, as time goes, many screen contents are being generated which share several properties of natural images. As a result, IQA methods for SCI need to be more generic while giving priority to the prominent SCI features. The image gradient is a very important feature for all kinds of images, especially for SCI. In this paper, we proposed a novel image gradient based similarity index (CGSI) for screen content images where the gradient is used both as a quality map and extractor for another feature map. Our previous studies show that the center part of an image is visually the most important part and HVS is more sensitive to any distortion in the middle area. To address this issue, the center area of both gradient and feature similarity maps are raised by element-wise squaring. Eventually, the final quality score is calculated using a summation of standard deviation based pooling strategy. We evaluated our proposed method on three large scale SCI databases and compared with 8 other state-of-the-art IQA methods designed for both natural and screen content images. Results show that the proposed approach provides competitive performance and defeats all other methods with a large gap in overall performance. Also, the relatively faster running time makes it suitable for most of the real-time applications.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Layek, Abu and Thu, Ngo Thien and Yu, SoYeon and Chung, TaeChoong and Huh, Eui-Nam},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/R5BFPAQT/Layek et al. - Center-Emphasized Gradient-Feature Based Quality A.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783488932,"version":0,"updated":1563899940468},"$loki":1401},{"itemID":5681,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{balakrishnan_active_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Active {{Decoupling Control}} for a {{Planetary Coaxial Helicopter Using Force Feedback}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437000/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437000},\n  abstract = {Drones developed for interplanetary space missions require full autonomy of operations including safe landing and hovering due to the delay in communication.

In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  urldate = {2019-02-14},\n  date = {2017-03-01},\n  pages = {74-84},\n  author = {Aloi, G. and Caliciuri, G. and Fortino, G. and Gravina, R. and Pace, P. and Russo, W. and Savaglio, C.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/L6P8YIFR/Aloi et al_2017_Enabling IoT interoperability through opportunistic smartphone-based mobile.pdf},\n  note = {00106}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783489324,"version":0,"updated":1563899939414},"$loki":1404},{"itemID":5572,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{yamazaki_spectrum_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Spectrum {{Sharing Exploiting Spectrum Database}} for {{LPWA}}},\n  abstract = {In the most of current low power wide area (LPWA), packet collisions of uplink communication are controlled by setting duty cycle (DC), which controls the transmission cycle not to exceed the predefined fixed threshold.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adaptive DC decision algorithm. The proposed algorithm aims at adapting the period that the system interferes with others and reducing the packet loss rate of uplink communication of the whole system to below the required value by adapting DC with the help of measurement-based spectrum database (MSD). In the proposed method, MSD knows the number of LoRa nodes that interfere with the nodes of other systems. The DC is calculated for keeping the period of interference to less than a certain duration. In addition, the DC is also adapted based on the required packet loss rate to improve communication efficiency. Computer simulation results show that the allowable interference time ratio and the required packet loss rate can be accurately guaranteed compared to the conventional method with the fixed DC even if the number of nodes increases.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Yamazaki, Yudai and Fujii, Takeo and Takyu, Osamu and Ohta, Mai and Adachi, Koichi},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HZA239DP/Yamazaki et al. - Spectrum Sharing Exploiting Spectrum Database for .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783489370,"version":0,"updated":1563899940384},"$loki":1405},{"itemID":5610,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kim_enhanced_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Enhanced {{Model}}-{{Free Deep}}-{{Q Network}} Based {{PTZ Camera Control Method}}},\n  abstract = {Recently, the algorithm based on reinforcement learning for controlling PTZ(Pan/Tilt/Zoom) of a camera has been significantly increasing.

As a multi-hop wireless network, U-Bus Air gathers meter reading information connected to a monitoring center. The terminal with the function of connecting to a monitoring center is called a gateway (GW). The multi-hop function is used to connect GWs; this reduces the cost of connecting wide-area wireless networks. However, the order of installing a new terminal is random because it is determined by timing of replacement on meter in individual homes on meters in individual homes. As a result, the installing location of GWs cannot be specified in advance. Consequently, any created network topology will exhibit redundancies, such as unnecessary GWs, or generate many small networks. In this paper, we propose two different redundancy reducing methods that use information of terminals on cloud to reconstruct a network topology. The proposed methods consists of three steps: gathering information, emulating the topology to reduce redundancy using cloud, and providing feedback to rebuild information of each smart meter. We perform a computer simulation to evaluate the packet delivery ratio (PDR) and the reduction ratio of the number of GWs. We confirm that the redundancy can be reduced by using the proposed methods without affecting the performance of the network topology.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {223-228},\n  author = {Sanada, Hiroshi and Fujii, Takeo and Aizawa, Reina and Kawata, Takuya},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/P8Y5RV88/Sanada et al. - 2018 - Routing Redundancy Reducing Method for U-Bus Air U.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783490510,"version":0,"updated":1563899940684},"$loki":1419},{"itemID":3787,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{asghari_internet_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Internet of {{Things}} Applications: {{A}} Systematic Review},\n  volume = {148},\n  issn = {13891286},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389128618305127},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.comnet.2018.12.008},\n  shorttitle = {Internet of {{Things}} Applications},\n  journaltitle = {Computer Networks},\n  shortjournal = {Comput.

However, basically, qubits are very vulnerable to errors, thus a quantum error correction code (QECC) is needed to build a reliable quantum computer. Moreover, simply using QECCs is not sufficient in order that a quantum computer can tolerate errors. In quantum computation, each operation must be performed on the encoded states. Even when the gates used to perform these operations are noisy, the quantum computation must be tolerable to the errors.

VMP is the process of selecting the most suitable physical machine (PM) to host the virtual machines (VMs). Typically, the placement goal falls under one of the following optimization criteria: the maximization of the PM usage or power consumption efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming model (MOMILP) aiming at simultaneously minimizing the VM rejection ratio, the resource wastage and the number of used PMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which combines such objectives in a Multi-Objective model. We also assume heterogeneous configuration for the data center which has been proven, through recent research work and industrial experience, to be more costeffective for some applications especially those with intensive Input/Output (I/O) operations. To assess the performance of the proposed model, a comparative study has been curried out. Through the simulation results, it was observed that the proposed model achieves total gains reaching 35\\% and 10\\% in terms of resource wastage and power consumption respectively. It was also reported that the power consumption is not only impacted by the number of used PMs but also by the selected PM configurations.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {401-406},\n  author = {Regaieg, Rym and Koubaa, Mohamed and Osei-Opoku, Evans and Aguili, Taoufik},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6WIMGPST/Regaieg et al. - 2018 - Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming M.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783490816,"version":0,"updated":1563899940760},"$loki":1423},{"itemID":4545,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{ramezan_blockchainbased_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Blockchain}}-{{Based Contractual Routing Protocol}} for the {{Internet}} of {{Things Using Smart Contracts}}},\n  volume = {2018},\n  issn = {1530-8669, 1530-8677},\n  url = {https://www.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2018/4029591/},\n  doi = {10.1155/2018/4029591},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based contractual routing (BCR) protocol for a network of untrusted IoT devices.

As a consequence, data breaches are expected to increase in gravity and occurrence. To counteract unintended data disclosure, a great deal of effort has been dedicated in devising methods for uncovering privacy leaks. Existing solutions, however, have not addressed the time- and data-intensive nature of leak detection. The shift from hardware-specific implementation to software-based solutions is the core idea behind the concept of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). On the other hand, the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm is characterized by the decoupling of the forwarding and control planes. In this paper, an SDN/NFV-enabled architecture is proposed for improving the efficiency of leak detection systems. Employing a previously developed identification strategy, Personally Identifiable Information detector (PIID) and load balancer VNFs are packaged and deployed in OpenStack through an NFV MANO.

Experimental results indicate that the proportions of forwarding and parsing on total overhead is influenced by the traffic intensity.

A lightweight yet efficient target localization algorithm is proposed and implemented, and a Quality of Service (QoS) knob is found to control the tradeoff between the tracking error and the network energy consumption.

Simulation results are also presented to show that the content transfer time in our cluster-based approach is less than the existing caching mechanisms.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Hasan, Kamrul and Jeong, Seong-Ho},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/N4M472Z8/Hasan and Jeong - Efficient Caching for Delivery of Multimedia Infor.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783494296,"version":0,"updated":1563899940872},"$loki":1455},{"itemID":4659,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{friedman_multimedia_2004d,\n  langid = {french},\n  title = {Multim\\'edia et Qualit\\'e de Service: c5},\n  date = {2004},\n  pages = {54},\n  author = {Friedman, Timur},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/AP4LUT4R/Friedman - M2 Informatique Réseaux Multimédia et Qualité de S.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783494570,"version":0,"updated":1563899940020},"$loki":1456},{"itemID":5021,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{gupta_battery_2019,\n  title = {Battery {{Optimal Configuration}} of {{Transmission Settings}} in {{LoRa Moving Nodes}}},\n  booktitle = {2019 16th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  date = {2019},\n  pages = {1--6},\n  author = {Gupta, Ashirwad and Fujinami, Makoto},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W27SM6GN/Gupta_Fujinami_2019_Battery Optimal Configuration of Transmission Settings in LoRa Moving Nodes.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/34S6HZIK/8651707.html},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783494626,"version":0,"updated":1563899940288},"$loki":1457},{"itemID":5100,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{gaddam_comparative_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Ernakulam}},\n  title = {A {{Comparative Study}} on {{Various LPWAN}} and {{Cellular Communication Technologies}} for {{IoT Based Smart Applications}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-5744-7},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8529060/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICETIETR.2018.8529060},\n  abstract = {The usage of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in device designing is increasing rapidly.

Many community detection methods are derived from specific backgrounds and their reliability is still questionable. Researchers hardly focus on the general definition of communities and the general community detection algorithms. The discrepancy between the two might pose some obstacles to the optimization of them so that it is hard to use one algorithm to perfect the other. Recently, Lu et al.

The current spectrum access process of legacy WLANs uses clear channel assessment (CCA) and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), where the spectrum is sensed before use and a random binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanism is employed for collision avoidance. While LAA uses a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism, moderately similar to the CCA CSMA/CA for channel access. However, there is a fairness issue when these two technologies coexist. In this paper, we propose a channel observation-based LBT (CoLBT) mechanism for fairness in LAAWi-Fi coexistence scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a more realistic practical channel observation-based collision probability observed by the LAA evolved Node B (eNB) to adaptively scale-up and scale-down the backoff contention window for channel contention, to reduce the waste of resources and improve LAAWiFi coexistence performance. Simulation results validate that the proposed CoLBT mechanism is effective in LAA-WiFi coexistence scenario and can improve fairness performance, compared with the current mechanism of LBT.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {154-158},\n  author = {Ali, Rashid and Shahin, Nurullah and Musaddiq, Arslan and Kim, Byung-Seo and Kim, Sung Won},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/CSIL7EYB/Ali et al. - 2018 - Fair and Efficient Channel Observation-Based Liste.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783495290,"version":0,"updated":1563899940660},"$loki":1462},{"itemID":5823,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{han_achievable_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Achievable {{Rate Evaluation}} by {{System Level Simulation}} for Mm {{Wave Based Backhaul Network Adopting}} In-{{Band Full}}-{{Duplex}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436798/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436798},\n  abstract = {The millimetre-wave(mmWave) based wireless backhaul operating in an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) mode is evaluated by system level simulation.

Guided by the Talk More Listen Less (TMLL) principle (published in 2016), in which beacons are not necessarily placed in the wakeup slots, we propose a different version of a group-based protocol, we call Talk Half Listen Half (THLH).

The difference between it and the existing congestion control algorithm is that it is derived from actual congestions. BBR measures the bottleneck bandwidth and round-trip propagation time sequentially and sends data based on bandwidth delay product (BDP). The mere dependence on the BDP unfairly allocates a larger part of the bandwidth to a flow with long RTT than a short RTT flow. This nature of the BBR entirely conflicts with the trend of traditional TCP where a short RTT flow is more vibrant than long RTT flow. To solve this problem, we previously proposed the bottleneck queue buildup suppression method and verified that through NS-3. However, during the testbed experiments, we found that the previous method was unstable and led to unexpected results. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an improved version of the previously proposed algorithm. We confirmed through extensive testbed experiments that our proposed BBR-E improves fairness between the flows with different RTTs and ensures better throughput.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Kim, Geon-Hwan and Song, Yeong-Jun and Mahmud, Imtiaz and Cho, You-Ze},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/LBGNC98K/Kim et al. - Enhanced BBR Congestion Control Algorithm for Impr.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783496390,"version":0,"updated":1563899940506},"$loki":1474},{"itemID":5744,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{meng_detectors_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Detectors for {{Intent ICC Security Vulnerability}} with {{Android IDE}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436802/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436802},\n  abstract = {With the time-to-market pressures for mobile app development is increasing, its development cycle is getting shorter and developers have little to no time for security remediation.

The main standard, IEEE802.15.4e 2012, introduces a deterministic and synchronous multi-channel extension (DSME) model. Three main issues should be tackled and improved with this model; a high energy consumption of end nodes during the contention access period (CAP), a long association and guaranteed time slot (GTS) earning times during a network initialization phase and a long network discovery time. These issues have been analysed and improved in a star topology wireless sensor network (WSN). Four scenarios with different numbers of nodes are investigated. Nodes numbers are set according to network saturation ratios (25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%). This paper proposes three enhancements for the performance of this model. Two new approaches are proposed to reduce the energy consumption of end nodes during the CAP period, a new association scheme during network initialization phase using a tight TDMA algorithm to minimize the time required for association and getting a GTS slot and reduce power consumption due to collisions, and a new technique to reduce network discovery time. Simulation results show significant improvements in reducing energy consumption and radio duty cycle (RDC) of end nodes by a factor of (71) and (77) respectively. Good improvements are also achieved in reducing association and GTS earning times by a factor of (8) on average. Finally, network discovery time has been reduced for fast association and further energy saving of end nodes.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {426-431},\n  author = {Alsudany, Sameer K. and Boussakta, Said and Johnston, Martin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TBGVGQTU/Alsudany et al. - 2018 - Enhancements of IEEE802.15.4e DSME Model of Wirele.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783496724,"version":0,"updated":1563899940770},"$loki":1479},{"itemID":4321,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{blenn_lorawan_2017,\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  eprint = {1706.03086},\n  primaryClass = {cs},\n  title = {{{LoRaWAN}} in the {{Wild}}: {{Measurements}} from {{The Things Network}}},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03086},\n  shorttitle = {{{LoRaWAN}} in the {{Wild}}},\n  abstract = {The Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) specification was released in 2015, primarily to support the Internet-of-Things by facilitating wireless communication over long distances.

Such relations represent links that are `tracked' by an ad-hoc implemented CoAP Crawler, which inspects the served resource state and chooses the link to follow from there, working as a Hypermedia-driven client. The Crawler is itself a Web-enabled device that dynamically draws an overlay network topology in which resources are represented as nodes and inter-device relationships as edges between pairs of nodes. This approach allows for the creation of a completely distributed, non-hierarchical, Peer-to-Peer overlay network.

Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments. Our proposed middleware is built on Android platform.},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2013-10-15},\n  author = {Perera, Charith and Jayaraman, Prem Prakash and Zaslavsky, Arkady and Christen, Peter and Georgakopoulos, Dimitrios},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/L26NV8MT/Perera et al_2013_MOSDEN.pdf},\n  note = {00107}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783497880,"version":0,"updated":1563899939310},"$loki":1492},{"itemID":4089,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{petajajarvi_coverage_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Copenhagen, Denmark}},\n  title = {On the Coverage of {{LPWANs}}: Range Evaluation and Channel Attenuation Model for {{LoRa}} Technology},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-9382-9},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7377400/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ITST.2015.7377400},\n  shorttitle = {On the Coverage of {{LPWANs}}},\n  abstract = {In addition to long battery life and low cost, coverage is one of the most critical performance metrics for the low power wide area networks (LPWAN).

For a node operating in the 868 MHz ISM band using 14 dBm transmit power and the maximum spreading factor, we have observed the maximum communication range of over 15 km on ground and close to 30 km on water. Besides the actual measurements, in the paper we also present a channel attenuation model derived from the measurement data.

These devices are usually battery operated and have a radio transceiver that is typically their most power-hungry block. Wake-up radio schemes can be used to achieve a reasonable balance among energy consumption, range, data receiving capabilities and response time. In this paper, a high-sensitivity low power wake-up radio receiver (WUR) for wireless sensor networks is presented. The wake-up radio is comprised of a fully passive differential RF-toDC converter that rectifies the incident RF signal, a low-power comparator and an ultra low power microcontroller to detects the envelope of the on-off keying (OOK) wake-up data used as address. We designed and implemented a novel low power tunable wake up radio with addressing capability, a minimal power consumption of only 196nW and a maximum sensitivity of -55dBm and minimal wake up time of 130{$\\mu$}s without addressing and around 1,6ms with 2byte addressing at 10Kbit/s data rate. The flexibility of the solution makes the wake up radio suitable for both power constrained low range application (such as Body Area Network) or applications with long range needs. The wake up radio can work also at different frequencies and the addressing capability directly on board helps reduce false positives. Experimental on field results demonstrate the low power of the solution, the high sensitivity and the functionality.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{IEEE}} 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{IEEE}} 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2014-10},\n  pages = {92-99},\n  author = {Magno, Michele and Benini, Luca},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/4N2XTWE6/Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/I2ZFEJCV/Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783498526,"version":0,"updated":1563899940188},"$loki":1500},{"itemID":5003,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{duda_wishwalt_2018,\n  title = {{{WiSH}}-{{WalT}}: {{A Framework}} for {{Controllable}} and {{Reproducible LoRa Testbeds}}},\n  shorttitle = {{{WiSH}}-{{WalT}}},\n  booktitle = {{{IEEE PIMRC}}},\n  date = {2018},\n  author = {Duda, Andrzej and Lone, Qasim and Duble, Etienne and Rousseau, Franck and Moerman, Ingrid and Giannoulis, Spilios},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TJZJPHU5/Duda et al_2018_WiSH-WalT.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783498550,"version":0,"updated":1563899940276},"$loki":1501},{"itemID":5729,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{go_relay_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Relay {{Position Considering Interference}} from {{Other Sub}}-{{Channels}} in {{D2D Group}}-Casting {{Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437023/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437023},\n  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a way to communicate directly between devices without going through the base station or other infrastructure.

Although sub-channels in OFDMA systems are theoretically orthogonal, there is non-negligible interference from other sub-channels due to in-band emission.

To this end, we naturally extend the definition of sample complexity so that it makes sense in the switching best arm setting, which may be of independent interest.

The OSN is usually described as a graph, in which the users are the vertices, and their connecting edges represent relationships such as friendships, interactions and messaging. In our previous research we have devised an Information Flow security model that gives the vertices and edges numerical attributes, based on their user credibility and connection strength, such as age of user account and the friendship duration of two users, from which we have assessed the level of information sharing willingness of an ego node to users that are not directly connected to it, thus categorizing them as adversaries or acquaintances. In this research we use this model to generate a trustworthy network of users by creating a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph instance and iterating the removal of the weak-attributed edges and their connected vertices. We use a known MST algorithm (Kruskal's algorithm) on this unique graph, thus achieving a good Trust threshold of a user network that allows a safe information flow in the OSN.

One of the major efforts to meet it is the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP(DASH) standard. However, its performance heavily depends on the client's adaptive quality selection algorithm that is not included in the standard. The existing conventional algorithms are basically based on a procedural algorithm that is not easy to capture and reflect all variations of dynamic network and traffic conditions in real network environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel quality selection mechanism based on the Deep Q-Network(DQN) model, the DQN-based DASH ABR(\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend{} ) mechanism. The proposed mechanism adopts a new reward calculation method based on five major performance metrics to reflect the current conditions of networks and devices in real time. The \\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend{} system is implemented as a separate server that is connected via a high-speed LAN to the simulation host where the ns-3 DASH simulation software is performed. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism quickly selects a suitable quality even in high error rate environments, significantly reducing the frequency of quality change compared to the existing algorithm and improving the average quality during video playback.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {561-566},\n  author = {Kim, Iseul and Hong, Seongjun and Jung, Sungwook and Lim, Kyungshik},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/JGK3L8Z8/Kim et al. - 2018 - A Quality Selection Mechanism Using a Deep Q-Netwo.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783500248,"version":0,"updated":1563899940838},"$loki":1523},{"itemID":4412,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{balevi_deep_2019,\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  eprint = {1904.09346},\n  primaryClass = {eess},\n  title = {Deep {{Learning}}-{{Based Channel Estimation}} for {{High}}-{{Dimensional Signals}}},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09346},\n  abstract = {We propose a novel deep learning-based channel estimation technique for high-dimensional communication signals that does not require any training.

The proposed deep channel estimator can outperform LS estimation with nearly the same complexity, and approach MMSE estimation performance to within 1 dB without knowing the second order statistics. The only complexity increase with respect to LS estimator lies in fitting the parameters of a deep neural network (DNN) periodically on the order of the channel coherence time. We empirically show that the main benefit of this method accrues from the ability of this specially designed DNN to exploit correlations in the time-frequency grid.

Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services.

A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature. Moreover, it delves into some of the challenges facing this paradigm, as well as the major SDWSN design requirements that need to be considered to address these challenges.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {1872-1899},\n  author = {Kobo, H.

The first is to reduce hardware management-related issues when working with complex networks, such as a lack of flexibility and scalability with regard to global configuration changes. The second is to create a communication library that provides programmable network function virtualization, helping to achieve the first aim. Specifically, we target low-cost, security-oriented networks that use broadband routers as L3 switches. When such networks have multiple IP domains between the external gateway and internal networks, domains that are lower in the hierarchy become more secure, but at the cost of flexibility. Our proposed system architecture aims to increase communication flexibility in such networks without requiring complex encapsulation and achieves this goal via a practical method that does not change the packet size.

Accordingly, we aim at developing the UL and DL precoders to suppress the influence of the RSI and CCI, where the EE criterion is adopted to reach the goal of the green communication. However, the EE precoder design is a fractional non-convex problem. To find the tractable solution, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) method to conduct the DL and UL precoders iteratively. For given DL precoders, the closed-form solution of UL precoders can be eventually yielded by an iterative water-filling (IWF) procedure. Nevertheless, the similar method cannot directly be applied to optimize the DL precoders. We then resort to the UL-DL duality that transfers the DL precoder design to an equivalent UL precoder design problem. We further apply the primal-dual decomposition to the DL precoder design and solve it by the IWF algorithm.

Experiments results were conducted using CALB in two scenarios: (1) Master controller is distributing switches among two slave controllers, and (2) master controller is distributing switches among three slave controllers.

New type of connectivity used in LowPower Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech's LoRaTM technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes - LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our findings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks.

We suppose that the residential users have own photovoltaic generation system and a smart meter which can schedule activation of home appliances and controls. The aggregator participates in energy market to maximize his profit by selling the storage to the residential users. Each user determines his energy consumption schedule and a required amount of storage to minimize his energy cost depending on the unit price of energy storage, price profile of electricity from the main grid and his renewable power generation capacity. We consider electricity bill from main grid and storage bill from the aggregator as users' energy cost. We formulate a problem for the aggregator to decide an optimal unit price of energy storage and a problem for each user to decide energy consumption schedule and a required amount of storage capacity. With numerical investigation, it is shown that the energy storage can reduce the energy load to main grid and shave peak power. As a result, by purchasing energy storage, users can save their energy cost by 43\\% in average compared to the case without energy storage.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Kim, Insook and Kim, Dongwoo},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/9TBKMCS2/Kim and Kim - Pricing-based shared energy storage optimization f.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783502390,"version":0,"updated":1563899940560},"$loki":1549},{"itemID":5685,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{baek_realtime_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Real-{{Time Drowsiness Detection Algorithm}} for {{Driver State Monitoring Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436988/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436988},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we proposes a novel drowsiness detection algorithm using a camera near the dashboard.

The result of the charge measured in the charging EV can be different from the charge amount claimed to be charged in the charging station. This is because the charge is measured separately from each other using its smart meters. And if mechanical measurements are assumed to be accurate, it is possible to lie in one of the EV or charging station. Also, billing information can be manipulated. To prevent those problems, this paper proposes the blockchain based billing system. The EV and the charging station store the billing information in the blockchain after mutual authentication and prevent the modification. A blockchain is the system in which all nodes have the same ledger, therefore cannot be tampered with. This prevents a user from modifying the record after charging.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {308-310},\n  author = {Jeong, Seohyeon and Dao, Nhu-Ngoc and Lee, Yunseong and Lee, Cheol and Cho, Sungrae},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3IJGP3TF/Jeong et al. - 2018 - Blockchain Based Billing System for Electric Vehic.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783502530,"version":0,"updated":1563899940720},"$loki":1551},{"itemID":3878,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{pham_connect_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Connect the {{LoRa}} Radio Module},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Pham, NiceRF},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/L5UXLINK/LoRa - Connect the LoRa radio module.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783502842,"version":0,"updated":1563899939616},"$loki":1552},{"itemID":4380,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{parsa_goaldriven_2016,\n  location = {{Tehran, Iran}},\n  title = {Towards a Goal-Driven Method for Web Service Choreography Validation},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-2166-6},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7498448/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICWR.2016.7498448},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{Second International Conference}} on {{Web Research}} ({{ICWR}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{Second International Conference}} on {{Web Research}} ({{ICWR}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2016-04},\n  pages = {66-71},\n  author = {Parsa, Saeed and Ebrahimifard, Amir and Amiri, Mohammad Javad and Arani, Mostafa Khoramabadi},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/7AZPAE4Y/Parsa et al_2016_Towards a goal-driven method for web service choreography validation.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783502976,"version":0,"updated":1563899939868},"$loki":1554},{"itemID":4509,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{harri_communication_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Communication {{Technologies}} and the {{Internet}} of {{Things}} in {{ITS}}},\n  date = {2015},\n  pages = {76},\n  author = {H\\\"arri, J\\'er\\^ome},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XHQS7T6A/Härri - Communication Technologies and the Internet of Thi.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783502992,"version":0,"updated":1563899939952},"$loki":1555},{"itemID":3391,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{collotta_novel_2012,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Palermo, Italy}},\n  title = {A {{Novel Road Monitoring Approach Using Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-1233-2 978-0-7695-4687-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6245667/},\n  doi = {10.1109/CISIS.2012.37},\n  abstract = {This paper shows an innovative Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) architecture based on a flexible Quality of Service (QoS) approach for road traffic management.

In the field of face recognition, researches using DNN have been carried out. However, face adversarial example is a serious threat in face recognition system. Face adversarial example adding a little of noise to the original face image can cause the misrecognition in the face recognition system. For example, an attacker intentionally modifies a face image with small distortion, which could cause the face recognition system to misidentify another person. It also shows the possibility of wrong recognition by another person when it is modulated by several points on the face. However, the concept of face friendsafe adversarial example can be useful in a military situation where friend and enemy forces are mixed. In the face recognition field, face friend-safe adversarial example may be needed that is correctly recognized by a friend face recognition system and misidentified by an enemy face recognition system. In this paper, we propose a face friend-safe adversarial example targeting the FaceNet face recognition system. The proposed scheme generates a face friend-safe adversarial example that is misrecognized by a enemy face recognition system but is correctly recognized by friend face recognition system with minimum distortion. For experiment, we used VGGFace2 and Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) as a dataset and Tensorflow as a machine learning library.

However, to ensure efficient and reliable communication LPWAN devices often provide a large number of transmission parameters. For example, a LoRa device can be configured to use different spreading factors, bandwidth settings, coding rates and transmission powers, resulting in over 6720 possible settings. It is a challenge to determine the setting that minimises transmission energy cost while meeting the required communication performance. This paper is the first to present a thorough analysis of the impact of LoRa transmission parameter selection on communication performance. We study in detail the impact of parameter settings on energy consumption and communication reliability. Using this study we develop a link probing regime which enables us to quickly determine transmission settings that satisfy performance requirements.

Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler's objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T . To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T . This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward ``variation'' and the minimal achievable regret, and by establishing a connection between the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},\n  booktitle = NIPS,\n  date = {2014},\n  author = {Gur, Yonatan and Zeevi, Assaf J. and Besbes, Omar},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/USD3V3PR/Gur et al_2014_Stochastic Multi-Armed-Bandit Problem with Non-stationary Rewards.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783503932,"version":0,"updated":1563899939770},"$loki":1565},{"itemID":4739,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pujolle_cell_2019i,\n  title = {{{CELL Cours}}-5-{{GP}}-{{Wi}}-{{Fi}}},\n  date = {2019},\n  author = {Pujolle},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/AIWP6WYX/Cours-5-GP-Wi-Fi.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783503954,"version":0,"updated":1563899940076},"$loki":1566},{"itemID":5740,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kang_study_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {A {{Study}} on the {{Effect}} of {{Moving}} Small Cell in {{Heterogeneous Networks}} with {{Interference Cancellation}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436766/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436766},\n  abstract = {Wireless data traffic is growing exponentially with the spread of smartphones and tablet PCs.

It provides unconditional secure communication based on the laws of physics. From the viewpoint of network research, QKD is considered to be a component for providing secure communication in network systems. A QKD network enables each node to exchange encryption keys with arbitrary nodes. However previous research did not focus on the processing speed of the key management method essential for a QKD network. This paper focuses on the key management method assuming a high-speed QKD system for which we clarify the design, propose a high-speed method, and evaluate the throughput. The proposed method consists of four modules: (1) local key manager handling the keys generated by QKD, (2) one-time pad tunnel manager establishing the transparent encryption link, (3) global key manager generating the keys for application communication, and (4) web API providing keys to the application. The proposed method was implemented in software and evaluated by emulating QKD key generation and application key consumption. The evaluation result reveals that it is capable of handling the encryption keys at a speed of 414 Mb/s, 185 Mb/s, 85 Mb/s and 971 Mb/s, for local key manager, one-time pad tunnel manager, global key manager and web API, respectively. These are sufficient for integration with a high-speed QKD system. Furthermore, the method allows the high-speed QKD system consisting of two nodes to expand corresponding to the size of the QKD network without losing the speed advantage.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Takahashi, Ririka and Tanizawa, Yoshimichi and Dixon, Alexander},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/E99P9AEB/Takahashi et al. - A high-speed key management method for quantum key.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783504246,"version":0,"updated":1563899940540},"$loki":1571},{"itemID":4962,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{truong_cellular_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Cellular {{Simulation}} for {{Distributed Sensing}} over {{Complex Terrains}}},\n  volume = {18},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/7/2323},\n  doi = {10.3390/s18072323},\n  abstract = {Long-range radio transmissions open new sensor application fields, in particular for environment monitoring. For example, the LoRa radio protocol enables connecting remote sensors at a distance as long as ten kilometers in a line-of-sight. However, the large area covered also brings several difficulties, such as the placement of sensing devices in regards to topology in geography, or the variability of communication latency. Sensing the environment also carries constraints related to the interest of sensing points in relation to a physical phenomenon. Thus, criteria for designs are evolving a lot from the existing methods, especially in complex terrains. This article describes simulation techniques based on geography analysis to compute long-range radio coverages and radio characteristics in these situations. As radio propagation is just a particular case of physical phenomena, it is shown how a unified approach also allows for characterizing the behavior of potential physical risks. The case of heavy rainfall and flooding is investigated. Geography analysis is achieved using segmentation tools to produce cellular systems which are in turn translated into code for high-performance computations. The paper provides results from practical complex terrain experiments using LoRa, which confirm the accuracy of the simulation, and scheduling characteristics for sample networks.

We apply a system called 'Mobile DeepLabv3', which uses atrous convolution when applying semantic image segmentation by using MobileNetV2 as a network backbone. The ADE20K dataset is used to train our models specific to indoor environments.

The common practice of clinical treatment is gradually being overhauled by ubiquitous healthcare systems. The wireless body area networks (WBANs) are becoming increasingly important for future healthcare applications. According to the human physiological information, WBAN not only sends the real-time notification to the user but also decreases the transmission delay of patient information to the physician for medical decision. When medical emergency information must be transmitted after a disaster occurrence, the number of WBANs and emergency traffic increase in the particular area. In the situations, a large number of WBANs may be close to each other, thus causing inter-WBAN interference and increasing the transmission delay. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dynamic channel selection scheme (DCSS) in IEEE 802.15.6 WBANs. DCSS records the channel interference degree which is used to adaptively select the best transmission channel and to effectively transmit data. It mitigates the inter-WBAN interference to improve the QoS violation and reduce power consumption when there are WBANs coexisting.},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Tseng, Hsueh-Wen and Wang, Yu-Bin and Yang, Yi and Wu, Ruei-Yu},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/9C8JLMEC/Tseng et al. - An Adaptive Channel Hopping Scheme in IEEE 802.15..pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783504848,"version":0,"updated":1563899940526},"$loki":1578},{"itemID":5889,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{jang_low_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {A {{Low Overhead Feedback Scheme}} of {{Channel Covariance Matrix}} for {{Massive MIMO Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436748/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436748},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {714-717},\n  author = {Jang, Youngrok and Lee, Dongheon and Choi, Sooyong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HFSR38I2/Jang et al. - 2018 - A Low Overhead Feedback Scheme of Channel Covarian.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783504870,"version":0,"updated":1563899941042},"$loki":1579},{"itemID":4432,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{moraes_publish_2018,\n  title = {A {{Publish}}/{{Subscribe Qos}}-{{Aware Framework For Massive Iot Traffic Orchestration}}},\n  url = {https://zenodo.org/record/1098298},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1098298},\n  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) application deployment requires the allocation of resources such as virtual machines, storage, and network elements that must be deployed over distinct infrastructures such as cloud computing, Cloud of Things (CoT), datacenters and backbone networks. For massive IoT data acquisition, a gateway-based data aggregation approach is commonly used featuring sensor/ actuator seamless access and providing cache/ buffering and preprocessing functionality. In this perspective, gateways acting as producers need to allocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is proposed a Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework (PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources between aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules IoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally,  the framework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled backbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users and consumers. Network resources are allocated using a Bandwidth Allocation Model (BAM) to achieve efficient network resource allocation for scheduled IoT data streams. PSIoT-Orch adopts an ICN (Information-Centric Network) PubSub architecture approach to handle IoT data transfers requests among framework components. The proposed framework aims at gathering the inherent advantages of an ICN-centric approach using a PubSub message scheme while allocating resources efficiently keeping QoS awareness and handling restricted network resources (bandwidth) for massive IoT traffic.},\n  journaltitle = Zenodo,\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2018-01-10},\n  author = {Moraes, Pedro Francesco and Reale, Rafael F. and Martins, Joberto S.

However, each solution provides its own IoT infrastructure, devices, APIs, and data formats leading to interoperability issues. Such interoperability issues are the consequence of many critical issues such as vendor lock-in, impossibility to develop IoT application exposing cross-platform, and/or cross-domain, difficulty in plugging non-interoperable IoT devices into different IoT platforms, and ultimately prevents the emergence of IoT technology at a large-scale. To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together.

Motivated by cognitive radio principles, a dynamic power allocation factor is designed for the ARS scheme based on instantaneous channel state information. Closed-form expressions are derived for outage probabilities of the near and far users, respectively. In addition, analytical expressions are derived for asymptotic outage probabilities of the FRS and ARS schemes, respectively. The superior outage performance achieved by the FRS and ARS schemes are corroborated by system-level simulation results.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Liu, Hongwu and Kwak, Kyung Sup},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/YFGCQDQ6/Liu and Kwak - Adaptive Rate Splitting for Uplink Non-Orthogonal .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783506480,"version":0,"updated":1563899940426},"$loki":1598},{"itemID":5836,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{choi_reservationbased_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Reservation-{{Based Cooperative Intersection Crossing Scheme}} for {{Autonomous Driving}} in the {{Intersection}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436693/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436693},\n  abstract = {This paper presents a scheme for crossing an intersection with no traffic light where multiple autonomous vehicles coming from different lanes must travel without collision.

By combining smartphones with existing vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and services when driving. In this paper we propose an Androidbased application that monitors the vehicle through an On Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) interface, being able to detect accidents. Our proposed application estimates the G force experienced by the passengers in case of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to detect accidents. The application reacts to positive detection by sending details about the accident through either e-mail or SMS to pre-defined destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone call to the emergency services. Experimental results using a real vehicle show that the application is able to react to accident events in less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{IEEE}} 36th {{Conference}} on {{Local Computer Networks}} ({{LCN}} 2011)},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{IEEE}} 36th {{Conference}} on {{Local Computer Networks}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-10},\n  pages = {813-819},\n  author = {Zaldivar, Jorge and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WB5YVW29/Zaldivar et al_2011_Providing accident detection in vehicular networks through OBD-II devices and.pdf},\n  note = {00189}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783506788,"version":0,"updated":1563899939324},"$loki":1600},{"itemID":4981,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{cattani_experimental_2017,\n  title = {An Experimental Evaluation of the Reliability of Lora Long-Range Low-Power Wireless Communication},\n  volume = {6},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks},\n  shortjournal = {J.

The performance is characterized using CAM CCDFs which serves as a base for the evaluation of a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control application. Two important effects has been identified that affect to the reliability of the communications. Firstly, there is a degradation with the distance that appears to be stronger for cars and more gentle for trucks. This indicates that occlusions heavily affect the connectivity of ITS-G5A. Secondly, the reliability is below expectations and some of the vehicles perform consistently worse than others. Although further investigation is required, a possible explanation for this is that a highly congested channel is making some of the vehicles get stuck and are not able to regularly access the channel.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-23},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {1899-1903},\n  author = {Parra, Ignacio and Garcia-Morcillo, Alvaro and Izquierdo, Ruben and Alonso, Javier and Fernandez-Llorca, D. and Sotelo, M.A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MJX82H6U/Parra et al. - 2017 - Analysis of ITS-G5A V2X communications performance.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783507418,"version":0,"updated":1563899939950},"$loki":1609},{"itemID":4515,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{mur_linux_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Linux {{Wi}}-{{Fi}} Open Source Drivers -Mac80211, Ath9k/Ath5k-},\n  date = {2019},\n  pages = {11},\n  author = {Mur, Daniel Camps},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/M5RVP68M/Mur - Linux Wi-Fi open source drivers -mac80211, ath9ka.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783507430,"version":0,"updated":1563899939960},"$loki":1610},{"itemID":5656,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kim_simultaneous_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Simultaneous {{Orthogonal Transmission}} for {{Direct Modulation Chirp Spread Spectrum Systems}}},\n  abstract = {A chirp spread spectrum (CSS) is classified into binary orthogonal keying (BOK) method that uses the orthogonal signals and direct modulation (DM) method that uses the antipodal signals.

The conventional base station is broken down into a Remote Radio Head (RRH) and a Base Band Unit (BBU). The RRHs are geographically scattered across multiple sites, whereas the BBUs are sheltered in a data center. In this context, deciding to which RRH users connect is known as the user association problem. As a function of network load conditions, some RRHs may be turned off, reducing network power consumption. Furthermore, RRHs may be mapped to a single BBU, achieving statistical multiplexing gain. Deciding what RRHs are grouped together is known as the RRH clustering problem. Traditionally, user association and RRH clustering are independently addressed. As these two problems are mutually dependent, we provide in this paper a framework for the joint optimization of the user association and the RRH clustering. Our objective is to minimize both the network power consumption and the total transmission delay. As this problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem, it can be solved through exhaustive search. However, the computational complexity becomes intractable as the network size increases. Therefore, we decouple our joint problem into two sub-problems. These sub-problems are iteratively solved until convergence. We further evaluate the performance of our proposed solution. Simulation results show that our optimal solution for the RRH clustering sub-problem outperforms the no-clustering solution, where one BBU is exclusively dedicated to each RRH, and the grand coalition solution, where all RRHs are associated with a single BBU.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {376-381},\n  author = {Taleb, Hussein and Helou, Melhem El and Khawam, Kinda and Lahoud, Samer and Martin, Steven},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SPWG8QVA/Taleb et al. - 2018 - Joint User Association and RRH Clustering in Cloud.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783507750,"version":0,"updated":1563899940748},"$loki":1614},{"itemID":5903,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_analysis_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {An {{Analysis}} of an {{RF Link Budget}} and {{RSSI Circuit Design}} for {{Long}}-{{Range Communications}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436624/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436624},\n  abstract = {It is important for vehicle drivers to obtain useful information through systems such as a global positioning system (GPS), an intelligent transportation system (ITS), or WiFi data communication.

In addition, this paper demonstrates a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) circuit employed to find the strongest received signal from multiple directions.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {768-770},\n  author = {Lee, Kyong-Hee},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/FZPG5MFM/Lee - 2018 - An Analysis of an RF Link Budget and RSSI Circuit .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783507772,"version":0,"updated":1563899941070},"$loki":1615},{"itemID":5097,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{dawaliby_adaptive_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Adaptive Dynamic Network Slicing in {{LoRa}} Networks},\n  volume = {98},\n  issn = {0167739X},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X18318429},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.future.2019.01.042},\n  abstract = {Knowing the heterogeneity of applications and services that need to to be supported in the internet of things (IoT), network slicing came out as a potential solution that virtually isolates 5G networks with various service requirements over a common physical network infrastructure. The latter needs to simultaneously support and isolate traffic issued from mobile and machine services which may require different needs in terms of reliability, latency, and bandwidth. In this paper, network slicing is investigated in LoRa networks over fixed and dynamic slicing strategies. The performance of LoRa slices is evaluated with different spreading factor (SF) configurations. Then, a dynamic inter-slicing algorithm is proposed based on a maximum likelihood estimation that avoids resource starvation and prioritizes a slice over another depending on its QoS requirements. Moreover, a novel intra-slicing strategy is proposed that maximizes resource allocation efficiency of LoRa slices with regard to their delay requirements. An energy module for LoRa in NS3 is also implemented to evaluate the energy consumption of devices in each slice. Simulation results performed in realistic LoRa scenarios highlight the utility of our proposition in improving QoS requirements of IoT devices and providing isolation between slices.},\n  journaltitle = {Future Generation Computer Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Future Gener.

Furthermore, modifications in OFDM waveform for relaxed synchronization and supporting short burst communications for Internet of Things (IoT) devices has paved the way for Universal Filtered MultiCarrier (UFMC) waveform. However, a major disadvantage in deployment of Non-Orthogonal UFMC is the high Peakto-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) being comparable to that of OFDMA. As such, additional PAPR reduction techniques are required for reducing the dynamic range of power amplifier deployed in communication system. We take up Power Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) in which available power is sliced between users and investigate the performance of SC-FDMA for PDNOMA UFMC systems for PAPR reduction. UFMC is known to provide additional diversity to transmitter in uplink and facilitates relaxed synchronization at the receiver side in downlink scenario. Simulation results show that in flat-fading scenario, BER performance of proposed system is found to be significantly better than OFDM and UFMC. However, BER performance of proposed system in AWGN channel is seen to be traded off as the extent of SC-FDMA precoding increases. Also, increasing pilots per subband leads to increased PAPR with OFDM, UFMC whereas SC-FDMA for PD-NOMA UFMC system shows stagnation and significant comparative reduction in PAPR values.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {507-511},\n  author = {Singh, Ajit and Naik, K.

Advances in MAC protocols have enabled significant lifetime improvements, but in systems with low data rate, idle listening, and other communication artifacts can begin to dominate costs. One proposal to combat this is the addition of a second, extremely low power radio component that is always-on. As a consequence of the extremely low power, such radios are incapable of decoding general data, and thus are often delegated the task of listening for a trigger, leading to the terminology wake-up radio, as this extremely low power radio is used to wake up a higher power radio, which is then used for data communication. While wake-up technology has been steadily evolving over the last decade in the hardware arena, few protocols have been developed to exploit it. In this work, we present WaCo, our wake-up radio COOJA extension that allows exploration of the capabilities of the wake-up radio from the desktop environment. We also use our extended simulator to concretely show the potential benefits of the wake-up radio hardware with two, standard data collection protocols.

Recently, both academia and industry are attracted to LoRaWAN because of its recent developments and applicability in the IoT environment. Mostly, the IoT concept involves massive end devices distributed over a wide topographical area, hence establishing a high density and large-scale environment. LoRaWAN makes use of six orthogonal spreading factors (SFs) in order to improve spectral efficiency and increase the capacity. In this paper, we focus on the LoRaWAN class A network end devices and the problem of network scalability under high-density urban environment by using both the confirmed and unconfirmed mode of communication. Simulation results show that the urban environment has a high impact on the distribution of SFs, thus leading to low network performance in terms of success ratio. We also observed that the use of acknowledgment limits the scalability of the LoRaWAN due to the duty cycle constraints. However, this study further reveals that elevating the antenna height can significantly improve the performance in an urban area.},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Farhad, Arshad and Kim, Dae-Ho and Pyun, Jae-Young},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ZITI53V6/Farhad et al. - Scalability of LoRaWAN in an Urban Environment A .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783510414,"version":0,"updated":1563899940992},"$loki":1631},{"itemID":4101,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{bonnefoi_multiarmed_2017,\n  location = {{Lisbon, Portugal}},\n  title = {Multi-{{Armed Bandit Learning}} in {{IoT Networks}}: {{Learning}} Helps Even in Non-Stationary Settings},\n  volume = {228},\n  url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01575419},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-76207-4_15},\n  shorttitle = {Multi-{{Armed Bandit Learning}} in {{IoT Networks}}},\n  booktitle = {{{CROWNCOM}} 2017 - 12th {{EAI International Conference}} on {{Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks}}},\n  series = {Lecture {{Notes}} of the {{Institute}} for {{Computer Sciences}}, {{Social Informatics}} and {{Telecommunications Engineering}}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-05},\n  date = {2017-09},\n  pages = {173-185},\n  keywords = {PDR},\n  author = {Bonnefoi, R\\'emi and Besson, Lilian and Moy, Christophe and Kaufmann, Emilie and Palicot, Jacques},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/CQPLIA32/Bonnefoi et al_2017_Multi-Armed Bandit Learning in IoT Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00013}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783510710,"version":0,"updated":1563899939758},"$loki":1632},{"itemID":5155,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{brown_5g_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{5G Service Velocity}} \\& the {{Distributed Cloud}}},\n  pages = {13},\n  author = {Brown, Gabriel},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/9N5VG6DC/Brown - 5G Service Velocity & the Distributed Cloud.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783510728,"version":0,"updated":1563899940336},"$loki":1633},{"itemID":5839,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{srednik_investigating_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Investigating {{Influence}} of {{North Korea Threat Events}} on {{Attractiveness}} of {{South Korea}} for {{Foreign Visitors}} through {{Big Data Analysis}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437003/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437003},\n  abstract = {Although South Korea (SK) is recognized as one of the most popular destinations for global tourism, concerns occur due to the ongoing threat of North Korea (NK).

In addition, the applications of the STPN to eight-phase, six-phase, and two-phase traffic-light control systems are modularized. The advantage of the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the behaviors of traffic lights in terms of the conditions and events that cause phase alternations. Moreover, the size of the urban traffic network control system can be easily extended with our proposed modular technique. An analysis of the control models is performed via a reachability graph method to demonstrate how the models enforce the transitions of the traffic lights.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures.

In addition, it is of increasing interest to researchers, which a group of drones are networked and coordinated to accomplish a mission delivered from Ground Control Station (GCS). To support those service scenarios, communication path should be maintained between GCS and the UAVs, and the UAVs should be able to exchange a message among themselves. However, communication range between GCS and the UAVs is bounded according to the transceiver power and its sensitivity. Hence, a multihop network approach need to be considered. In such multihop networks, routing protocol plays an important role. Accordingly, in this paper, we present a geolocation-based routing protocol for Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs) with multihop network communication. Our protocol shows robust and resilient performance to the dynamic multihop network topology. A network topology composed of UAVs is highly dynamic due to the high speed of UAVs while executing missions. In this circumstance, our protocol uses geolocation information of neighbors and then find the routing path to the destination by only considering the neighbor information, which in turn, results in low overhead and robustness to the dynamic network topology in FANETs. We also provide implementation of the proposed geolocation-based routing protocol and testbed environments.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {50-52},\n  author = {Choi, Sung-Chan and Hussen, Hassen Redwan and Park, Jong-Hong and Kim, Jaeho},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/G2JAF89B/Choi et al. - 2018 - Geolocation-Based Routing Protocol for Flying Ad H.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783512366,"version":0,"updated":1563899940610},"$loki":1655},{"itemID":4188,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{mikhaylov_analysis_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Analysis of {{Capacity}} and {{Scalability}} of the {{LoRa Low Power Wide Area Network Technology}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper we discuss and analyze the recently proposed LoRa low power wide area network (LPWAN) technology when used under the European frequency regulations.

A discrete event simulation of the controlled intersection validates the model and tests the signal timing plan obtained by an optimization strategy presented in the related literature.},\n  number = {18},\n  journaltitle = {IFAC Proceedings Volumes},\n  shortjournal = {IFAC Proceedings Volumes},\n  series = {7th {{International Workshop}} on {{Discrete Event Systems}} ({{WODES}}'04), {{Reims}}, {{France}}, {{September}} 22-24, 2004},\n  urldate = {2019-01-27},\n  date = {2004-09-01},\n  pages = {207-212},\n  author = {Dotoli, Mariagrazia and Fanti, Maria Pia},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MY2656ZE/Dotoli_Fanti_2004_An urban traffic network model via coloured timed petri nets.pdf},\n  note = {00101}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":611,"created":1563783512902,"version":0,"updated":1563899939390},"$loki":1660},{"itemID":4936,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{lebreton_implementation_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Implementation of a {{Wake}}-up {{Radio Cross}}-{{Layer Protocol}} in {{OMNeT}}++ / {{MiXiM}}},\n  abstract = {This paper presents the DoRa protocol, which is a new cross-layer protocol for handling the double radio of nodes in wake-up radio scenario.

These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard. We also discuss the research challenges and perspectives.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun. Surv.

Also, access to high bandwidth, extendibility and dynamic management are of critical significance, especially when network devices are vertically integrated. Hence, a set of unique predefined line commands and operating systems or firmware should be used. SDN (software-defined networking) is a structure designed for simplifying and improving network management with high flexibility by splitting control plane and data plane. Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities. Although SDN is regarded as a new research issue, it has attracted numerous researchers' attention from both industrial and academic institutes. In this paper, data plane, control plane and application plane as the three planes of SDN and the interfaces between them such as OpenFlow are investigated and the challenges and the latest technologies in relation to SDN are examined. The investigation and overview of SDN reported in this paper might be used by the interested future researchers to better understand and apply SDN in real-life applications.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {J.

The most important challenge is to reduce power consumption when receivers are idle, the so called idle-listening cost. One approach proposes switching off the main receiver, then introduces new wake-up circuitry capable of detecting an incoming transmission, optionally discriminating the packet destination using addressing, then switching on the main radio only when required. This wake-up receiver technology represents the ultimate frontier in low power radio communication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review of the research progress in wake-up radio (WuR) hardware and relevant networking software. First, we present an overview of the WuR system architecture, including challenges to hardware design and a comparison of solutions presented throughout the last decade.

The aim of our adaptive approach is to detect the critical event, such a fire detection in the forest, at the required delay with minimum energy consumption. So, when an event occurs, only the sensor nodes in the detection area will be in active mode, while the others will be in sleep mode. The reaction to the event is made locally. This behavior can consume less energy. The simulation results show that our adaptive approach is better than the non-adaptive approach. We have compared our results to other works and we have proved the efficiency of our approach in terms of energy consumption.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{Fourth International Conference}} on {{Communications}} and {{Networking}} ({{ComNet}})},\n  booktitle = {Fourth {{International Conference}} on {{Communications}} and {{Networking}}, {{ComNet}}-2014},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2014-03},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  author = {Gherairi, Salsabil and Ouni, Sofiane and Kamoun, Farouk},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TCNUSY9M/Gherairi et al. - 2014 - Adaptive TDMA-based clustering for critical event .pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":589,"created":1563806484734,"version":0,"updated":1563899940122},"$loki":1703},{"itemID":4978,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{sandoval_optimal_2018,\n  title = {Optimal Policy Derivation for {{Transmission Duty}}-{{Cycle}} Constrained {{LPWAN}}},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Internet of Things Journal},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Internet Things J.},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {3114--3125},\n  author = {Sandoval, Ruben M. and Garcia-Sanchez, Antonio-Javier and Garcia-Haro, Joan and Chen, Thomas M.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/55GHVPCN/Sandoval et al_2018_Optimal policy derivation for Transmission Duty-Cycle constrained LPWAN.pdf},\n  note = {00004}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":587,"created":1563806656642,"version":0,"updated":1563899940268},"$loki":1705},{"itemID":4787,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kokila_energy_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Energy {{Efficient Routing Protocol}} for {{Self}}-{{Adaptive Sleep}}/{{Wake}}-{{Up Scheduling Approach}} in {{WSN}}},\n  volume = {6},\n  issn = {23219653},\n  url = {http://ijraset.com/fileserve.php?FID=16835},\n  doi = {10.22214/ijraset.2018.4745},\n  abstract = {WSN sensors, usually deployed in the non-accessible environment, are powered using small batteries along with techniques for power harvesting where replacing batteries are not an option. Relying on a battery not only limits the sensor's lifetime but also makes efficient design and management of WSNs a real challenge. The energy supply limitation provoked many research on WSN allthe protocol layers. This project focus on efficient sleep/wake-up scheduling, aiming to minimize idle listening time thereby reducing the energy consumption, which is one of the fundamental research problems in WSNs. The nodes are kept in rest mode keeping in mind the end goal to spare the vitality of every node to the extent that this would be possible without comprising on packet delivery effectiveness and consequently lifetime was increased. The proposed strategy proposes a vitality productive directing convention with self versatile sleep/wakeup planning that precisely predicts the path and sends the packet through cluster based predicted path in P-LEACH the cluster arrangement technique of LEACH in the chain based architecture of PEGASIs is utilized. Finally, the simulation results of the proposed method show improved lifetime, low energy utilization and reduced delay.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology},\n  shortjournal = {Int.

At present, clustering routing algorithm is more widely used in wireless sensor networks. But this way of transmitting information through the cluster can lead to uneven energy consumption in the network, which is known as the ``hot zone'' problem. However, the uneven clusters, the way of multi-hop transmission between clusters can solve this problem.

In this letter, we analyze LoRa systems for increasing average system packet success probability (PSP) under unslotted ALOHA random access protocol. The lower bound for average system PSP is derived when many contending EDs are transmitting by stochastic geometry. And it is shown that the average system PSP can be maximized by properly allocating an SF to each traffic, which also maximizes connectivity of EDs. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the average system PSP to propose a sub-optimal SF allocation scheme to each traffic. Analysis on PSP is validated through simulations, and comparison with existing schemes reveals that our proposed scheme achieves the highest PSP and so the maximum connectivity.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Letters},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

In this paper, we focus on the blockchain network with shards and adopt the security-deposit based consensus protocol, studying the problem of how to balance the security incentive and the economic incentive. Also, the inherent features of the blockchain, i.e., anonymity and decentralization, introduce the information asymmetric issue between the beacon chain and the participants. The contract theory is utilized to formulate the problem between them. As such, the optimal rewards related to the different types of validators can be obtained, as well as the reasonable deposits accordingly. Compared with the fixed deposits, the flexible deposits can provide enough economic incentive for the participants without losing the security incentives.

To utilize such extra resources, in this paper we introduce a model that leverages transaction parallelism by partitioning the nodes into clusters (partitions) and processing independent transactions on different partitions simultaneously. The model also shards the blockchain ledger, assigns different shards of the blockchain ledger to different clusters, and includes both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions.

Recently, the concept of off-chain payments is introduced that led to the idea of establishing a payment network called Lightning Network (LN). Off-chain links provide the ability to do transactions without writing to Blockchain. However, LN's design still favors fees and is creating hub nodes that defeat the purpose of Blockchain. In addition, it is still not reliable as not all the transactions are guaranteed to be transmitted to their destinations. If current retailers would like to use it, these problems might hinder its adoption. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate creating a private payment network among a given set of retailers that will serve their business needs, just like the idea of private Blockchains. The goal is to build a pure peer-to-peer topology that will eliminate the need for relays and increase the robustness of payments. Using off-chain links as edges and retailers as nodes, the problem is formulated as a multi-flow commodity problem where transactions represent the commodities from various sources to destinations. As the multi-flow commodity problem is NP-Complete, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in a dynamic way by updating the edge weights when new payment paths are to be found. The order of transactions is randomized to provide fairness among the retailers.

Besides the use for securing financial activity, blockchain technology is now also merged with various emerging applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET). However, such emerging applications may have comparatively low Internet connectivity due to incorporating mobile devices, that may range away from network infrastructure. This paper investigates the impact of network latency on blockchain forking behavior and possible violations of the aforementioned six confirmations convention for transaction approval. To speed up our simulations, we simplify the blockchain's data structure, and avoid the extensive computation required in proof-of-work (PoW). Through simulation, we show that the six confirmations convention is sensitive to the peer-to-peer network latency, and also show how quickly it is violated with an easier difficulty of PoW mining. Unsurprisingly, the speed at which all nodes on the blockchain converge is shown to be severely affected by the latency of the underlying peer-to-peer network. It is also shown the extent to which nodes with more frequent Internet connectivity can gain an unfair advantage in terms of proof-ofwork mining rewards. We thus recommend that networks with heterogeneous latency profiles across nodes monitor fairness, and potentially preclude some nodes from being miners.},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Wan, Luming},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/YFD3SLLR/Wan - Evaluating the Impact of Network Latency on the Sa.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":486,"created":1563874098790,"version":0,"updated":1563899941188},"$loki":1916},{"itemID":6103,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{_data_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Data {{Mining}}-{{Based Ethereum Fraud Detection}}},\n  abstract = {The popularity of blockchain-based currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, has grown among enthusiasts since 2009.

According to an IBS report, the cost of developing a System on Chip (SoC) at 14nm may be as high as \\$300 million [1]. The economics of semiconductor IC development favors high volume production, while high volume cannot be attained without developing an IC that serves a large number of applications. Some of these applications are in lowmargin Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where an SoC cannot command a high price. Consequently, without the ability to customize IC features after production, the price of an IC will be determined by its lowest priced application. This motivates the manufacturers to develop capabilities for post-production IC customization. The commodity microprocessor business offers an example of post-production customization, where a manufacturer can tailor cache size, number of cores and frequency of operation for a target market segment after a chip has been manufactured. Today, such customization is limited to one-time programming (OTP) for predetermined IC bins. In this paper, we explore how an IC can be programmed repeatedly and securely using a blockchain-based smart contract. This will enable users to upgrade IC features, or rent upgraded IC features for a fixed period after it has been purchased. The availability of such a system could, for example, allow a buyer to upgrade her processor from i3 to i5 after it has been purchased to scale to her computing needs in exchange of a payment made to the manufacturer. IC feature configuration is implemented by firmware updates from the manufacturer. The smart contract takes the feature configuration request from the IC as input and outputs the source of corresponding firmware. To support remote and authorized update by manufacturer, we propose an on-die hardware module that communicates with the smart contract and enforces its functionalities. Availability of this module also facilitates secure firmware update. The blockchain makes the update protocol secure and prevents users from obtaining unauthorized update.

In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a ``data marketplace'' by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial transaction and providing ``by design'' remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end.

Due to the benefits of energy harvesting (EH) technologies, wireless devices are able to support the dataintensive wireless multimedia services by harvesting energy from the environment. Energy harvesting has emerged as the promising technology to solve the energy supply problem while bringing new challenges due to the stochastic nature of the harvested energy in supporting the heterogeneous statistical quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. However, due to the unknown dynamics of the harvested energy as well as the channel state information (CSI), it is challenging to design the efficient routing protocol for selecting the optimal routing and power allocation policies under the statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints.

The fraction of time that the radio in ON is called duty cycle and low duty cycle schedule could help save energy. Most works focus on designing efficient discovery schedule under a pre-defined low duty cycle such that the neighboring nodes can discover each other in a short time. In this paper, we study a more practical problem where each node could adjust the duty cycle dynamically by the remaining energy or the subsequent tasks, which is referred to as adjustable neighbor discovery.

However, the learning process of the existing federated learning platforms rely on the direct communication between the model owner, e.g., central cloud or edge server, and the mobile devices for transferring the model update. Such a direct communication may be energy inefficient or even unavailable in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider adopting the relay network to construct a cooperative communication platform for supporting model update transfer and trading. In the system, the mobile devices generate model updates based on their training data. The model updates are then forwarded to the model owner through the cooperative relay network. The model owner enjoys the learning service provided by the mobile devices. In return, the mobile devices charge the model owner certain prices. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission among the mobile devices that use the same relay node, the rational mobile devices have to choose their relay nodes as well as deciding on their transmission powers. Thus, we formulate a Stackelberg game model to investigate the interaction among the mobile devices and that between the mobile devices and the model owner.

Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a singlekeyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved.

Unfortunately, IoT devices may be limited with storage and computational resources to operate highly secure operations and respond to data requests. In this paper, we propose SSP, a novel mechanism that protects the privacy and integrity of the data collected by IoT devices without having a single point of failure, while minimizing the cryptographic operations that must be performed on IoT devices.

Current blockchain solutions store transactions in append-only and immutable fashion without any indexing, which contributes to limited and inefficient queries. Additionally, there is no support for privacypreserving query processing. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a system that can provide auditors, enforcing regulatory compliance, with efficient, scalable and richer blockchain query processing over Hadoop and synchronized Ethereum clients.

Although blockchain technology has the potential to address these challenges through providing a tamper-proof audit trail of supply chain events and data associated with a product lifecycle, it does not solve the trust problem associated with the data itself. Reputation systems are an effective approach to solve this trust problem. However, current reputation systems are not suited to the blockchain based supply chain applications as they are based on limited observations, they lack granularity and automation, and their overhead has not been explored. In this work, we propose TrustChain, as a three-layered trust management framework which uses a consortium blockchain to track interactions among supply chain participants and to dynamically assign trust and reputation scores based on these interactions. The novelty of Trustchain stems from: (a) the reputation model that evaluates the quality of commodities, and the trustworthiness of entities based on multiple observations of supply chain events, (b) its support for reputation scores that separate between a supply chain participant and products, enabling the assignment of product-specific reputations for the same participant, (c) the use of smart contracts for transparent, efficient, secure, and automated calculation of reputation scores, and (d) its minimal overhead in terms of latency and throughput when compared to a simple blockchain based supply chain model.},\n  pages = {10},\n  author = {Malik, Sidra},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/Z8L8CC4N/Malik - TrustChain Trust Management in Blockchain and IoT.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":60,"created":1563888269882,"version":0,"updated":1563899941182},"$loki":2378},{"itemID":6090,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{wang_fastchain_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{FastChain}}: {{Scaling Blockchain System}} with {{Informed Neighbor Selection}}},\n  abstract = {The main advantage of the Bitcoin-style blockchain systems is immutability of data and decentralized authority.

To address this issue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a subset of nodes c as a root committee.

It is an autonomous network where peers may submit models with improved accuracy and other peers may verify the accuracy improvement. The system maintains an append-only decentralized ledger to keep the log of critical information, including who has trained the model and improved its accuracy, when it has been improved, by how much it has improved, and where to find the newly updated model. DaiMoN rewards these contributing peers with cryptographic tokens. A main feature of DaiMoN is that it allows peers to verify the accuracy improvement of submitted models without knowing the test labels. This is an essential component in order to mitigate intentional model overfitting by model-improving peers. To enable this model accuracy evaluation with hidden test labels, DaiMoN uses a novel learnable Distance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function proposed in this paper. Specific to each test dataset, DEL scrambles the test label vector by embedding it in a low-dimension space while approximately preserving the distance between the dataset's test label vector and a label vector inferred by the classifier. It therefore allows proof-of-improvement (PoI) by peers without providing them access to true test labels. We provide analysis and empirical evidence that under DEL, peers can accurately assess model accuracy. We also argue that it is hard to invert the embedding function and thus, DEL is resilient against attacks aiming to recover test labels in order to cheat.

In this paper, we propose a new architecture of Urban Traffic Light Control based on an IoT network (IoT-UTLC). The objective is to interconnect both roads' infrastructures and traffic lights through an IoT platform. We designed our IoT-UTLC by selecting motes and protocols of wireless sensor network (WSN). Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has been integrated to manage QoS. It enables lights to adapt remotely to any situation and smoothly interrupt traffic light's classic cycles. Our experimental results show that the MQTT protocol is efficient when the packets rate exceeds 35\\% of traffic flow, it reduces traffic delay up to 0.05s at 90\\% of congestion. After verification and validation of our solution using a UPPAAL model checker, our system has been prototyped. Motes' functions have been implemented on Contiki OS and connected via a 6LoWPAN/IEEE 802.15.4 network. Timestamping messages have been performed throughout the system to evaluate the MQTT protocol with different QoS levels.

The message delivery between participated nodes and gateway in the WSNs affects the quality of service (QoS) such as energy consumption and the successful delivery rate (SDR). In this paper, we present a novel packet transmission model for a smart wireless paging sensor network (WPSN) based on LoRaWAN, which supports a real-time elderly care application. The model is used to investigate the performance of star topology communication on elderly care via Markov discrete-time M/M/1 queuing system. The proposed traffic model enables the performance evaluation of WPSN for elderly care. Moreover, an optimal cluster allocation policy is proposed by which maximizing SDR are obtained and QoS constraint requirements are met in terms of energy consumption. We conduct analytic analysis and simulation to exploit the QoS of LoRa based WSNs for elderly care application. The proposed WPSN is experimental studied and validated in a real elder care scenario.

More specifically, this paper focuses on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This paper presents a detailed model of CSS, showing that the symbols are not perfectly orthogonal. The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufficient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2016-11},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  keywords = {SF},\n  author = {Reynders, Brecht and Pollin, Sofie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WMB5B87Q/Reynders and Pollin - 2016 - Chirp spread spectrum as a modulation technique fo.pdf},\n  note = {00051}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":32,"created":1563893520778,"version":0,"updated":1563899939782},"$loki":2413},{"itemID":4446,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_1alliance_2015,\n  title = {1-{{ALLIANCE}}},\n  date = {2015},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/99EFHYWK/2015 - ALLIANCE.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":31,"created":1563895076502,"version":0,"updated":1563899939924},"$loki":2414},{"itemID":4445,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_1semtech_,\n  title = {1-{{SEMTECH}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/E5FUSDPG/SEMTECH.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":30,"created":1563895091360,"version":0,"updated":1563899939922},"$loki":2415},{"itemID":3992,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_1libelium_,\n  title = {1-{{LIBELIUM}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/UCRJZKHD/waspmote_lora_868mhz_915mhz_sx1272_networking_guide.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":29,"created":1563895121186,"version":0,"updated":1563899939674},"$loki":2416},{"itemID":4753,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_1lora_,\n  title = {1-{{Lora}}: {{Detection Theory}}},\n  keywords = {PL},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/IREH59NG/myDetectionTheoryNotes.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":28,"created":1563895135614,"version":0,"updated":1563899940114},"$loki":2417},{"itemID":6458,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bialon_impact_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {On the {{Impact}} of {{Device Characteristics}} on {{Opportunistic Network Performance}}},\n  abstract = {With smartphones gaining relevance in everyone's regular day more than ever, the application of opportunistic networks on those devices has become a popular field of research, as it enables smartphones to connect locally with high bandwidth and to provide networked applications for regional use. Conventional Delay Tolerant Networks and opportunistic network methods and techniques however cannot be directly applied on smartphones. Challenges are brought up by missing ad-hoc communication possibilities and system architecture constraints. Through tethering hotspot-based communication it is possible to create opportunistic networks for smartphones, although with specific network characteristics. We conduct a survey on the impact of device characteristics and network transmission properties on the overall network performance. Using the ONE simulator, we deploy a tethering hotspot-based connection strategy and, as the main contribution of this paper, asses the influence of single device properties onto the global opportunistic network performance.

To analyze the service selection of the secondary transmitters, we formulate the problem as an evolutionary game. Specifically, we model the service adaptation of the secondary transmitters by the replicator dynamics, and analytically prove that a unique evolutionary equilibrium is reached by the evolutionary game. Also, we prove that the evolutionary equilibrium is stable.

The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa configuration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the traffic intensity. The comparison shows the benefits of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its configuration according to its link budget.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-30},\n  date = {2018-10},\n  pages = {192-199},\n  author = {Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Suraty, Luiz and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/CN8P8U28/Ochoa et al. - 2018 - Large Scale LoRa Networks From Homogeneous to Het.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":22,"created":1563897053016,"version":0,"updated":1563899939694},"$loki":2423},{"itemID":4417,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{samie_distributed_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {*{{Distributed Trade}}-{{Based Edge Device Management}} in {{Multi}}-{{Gateway IoT}}},\n  volume = {2},\n  issn = {2378962X},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3232714.3134842},\n  doi = {10.1145/3134842},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems},\n  shortjournal = {ACM Trans.

The IoT gateways play an important role in the IoT applications to bridge between sensor networks and the external environment through the Internet. Typically, the IoT gateways collect and send the data collected from sensors and actuators to external platforms where they will be remotely analyzed. However, the users desire a more adapted IoT gateway that can improve the IoT data privacy preservation before sending them to these external platforms. Thus, an IoT gateway that enables a better control over the set of private IoT resources and protects the collected personal data and their privacy is required. For this purpose, we propose a Semantic IoT Gateway that helps implement a dynamic and flexible privacy-preserving solution for the IoT domain. First, it enables to match between the data consumer's terms of service and the data owner's privacy preferences by generating an adapted privacy policy. Second, it converts the privacy policy into a custom smart contract. Finally, it connects a set of private IoT resources to a distributed network using the blockchain technology to host the generated smart contracts. A smart contract is an executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. Our proposal, which is highlighted through an example and experimentation on a real-world use-case, has given the expected results.},\n  booktitle = {On the {{Move}} to {{Meaningful Internet Systems}}. {{OTM}} 2018 {{Conferences}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {207-225},\n  author = {Loukil, Faiza and Ghedira-Guegan, Chirine and Boukadi, Khouloud and Benharkat, A\\\"icha Nabila},\n  editor = {Panetto, Herv\\'e and Debruyne, Christophe and Proper, Henderik A. and Ardagna, Claudio Agostino and Roman, Dumitru and Meersman, Robert},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W3ZCMLKK/Loukil et al. - 2018 - Semantic IoT Gateway Towards Automated Generation.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":18,"created":1563897659848,"version":0,"updated":1563899939982},"$loki":2427},{"itemID":3692,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bendaoud_network_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {*{{Network Selection}} in {{Wireless Heterogeneous Networks}}: A {{Survey}}},\n  volume = {4},\n  issn = {15094553, 18998852},\n  url = {https://www.itl.waw.pl/czasopisma/JTIT/2018/4/64.pdf},\n  doi = {10.26636/jtit.2018.126218},\n  shorttitle = {Network {{Selection}} in {{Wireless Heterogeneous Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Heterogeneous wireless networks is a term referring to networks combining different radio access technologies with the aim of establishing the best connection possible. In this case, users with multi-mode terminals can connect via different wireless technologies, such as 802.16, 802.11, UMTS, HSPA and LTE, all at the same time. The problem consists in the selection of the most suitable from all radio access technologies available. The decision process is called network selection, and depends on several parameters, such as quality of service, mobility, cost, energy, battery life, etc. Several methods and approaches have been proposed in this context, with their objective being to offer the best QoS to the users, and/or to maximize re-usability of the networks. This paper represents a survey of the network selection methods used. Multiple attribute-dependent decision-making methods are presented. Furthermore, the game theory concept is illustrated, the use of the fuzzy logic is presented, and the utility functions defining the network selection process are discussed.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Telecommunications and Information Technology},\n  shortjournal = {J.

This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the offered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of e ciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for different multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of different parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study. In the first part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user's preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario. We also improve the latter solution by proposing a network selection algorithm that provides a load balancing technique based on matching game theory to overcome network overload conditions in high-speed scenarios. In the second part, the performance study has been evaluated for two scenario types: Cellular and Vehicular. The proposed algorithms were evaluated and validated in both mobile and vehicular environments using the NS3 simulator.},\n  institution = {{Universit\\'e Mohammed V - Rabat}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2017-10-21},\n  keywords = {Game},\n  author = {Drissi, M.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ZI97W7CU/Drissi_2017_A Multi Criteria Real Time Network Selection Framework in Heterogeneous.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":13,"created":1563898102800,"version":0,"updated":1563899939530},"$loki":2430},{"itemID":5165,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kaddour_management_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {*{{Management}} of Joint Radio Resources in Heterogeneous Networks {{Beyond 3G}}},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {126},\n  author = {Kaddour, M and Didi, F and Abdennebi, M},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/H9N2FZZT/Kaddour et al. - A.

The massive number of connected devices associated to its random spatial deployment and random network access introduce new degrees of freedom, demanding for innovative performance evaluation approaches. In this paper we study the interference caused to a LoRa gateway due to the uplink transmissions of multiple coexisting LoRa devices. By admitting an uniform spatial distribution of the devices, we show that the aggregate interference caused to a LoRa gateway follows a nonGaussian distribution and its power can be approximated by a sum of independent non-identical gamma random variables. Our work adopts a typical LoRaWAN operating scenario where the transmissions of LoRa Class A devices are affected by path-loss, shadowing and Rayleigh fading. Numerical results obtained with the modeling methodology are compared with simulation results, and the validation of the proposed model is discussed for different transmission probabilities.},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Irio, Luis and Oliveira, Rodolfo},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TLWBA2M8/Irio and Oliveira - Modeling the Interference caused to a LoRaWAN Gate.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":9,"created":1563984997296,"version":0,"updated":1563985950316},"$loki":2518},{"itemID":3248,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{debbah_wireless_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Wireless {{AI}}: {{Challenges}} and {{Opportunities}}},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {52},\n  author = {Debbah, M\\'erouane},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/AMH4ZCA3/Debbah_Wireless AI.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":9,"created":1563984997534,"version":0,"updated":1563985949096},"$loki":2519},{"itemID":5559,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{chu_interference_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Interference {{Analysis}} of {{Directional UAV Networks}}: {{A Stochastic Geometry Approach}}},\n  abstract = {We characterize the interference characteristics of directional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks based on the stochastic geometry, where each UAV is equipped with a directional antenna and is placed in three dimensional (3D) locations.

Given a beamwidth, we first design an ideal 3D directional antenna model with a constant gain of both main-lobe and side-lobe.

One of the methods to improve user's cost satisfaction in recommending multimedia contents is to use mood inherent in multimedia contents. SNS services based on mood folksonomy are applications using such a method. However, in the applications based on folksonomy, the problem caused by synonyms exists. This paper suggests a cost-satisfactive multimedia contents recommendation method to solve the problem on synonym.

We also show that the module correctly represents the capture effect that lowers the packet drop rate due to collisions. Second, we want to improve the performance of LoRa devices while not impacting energy consumption, the aspect that usually is not taken into account in the literature. We use the simulator to evaluate CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), a simple enhancement to LoRaWAN that lowers the collision ratio. The simulation results show that CSMA considerably lowers the collision ratio while only slightly increasing energy consumption. We also observe that CSMA presents lower energy consumption than LoRa for a large number of devices. Another advantage of CSMA consists of increased throughput and larger network capacity because the ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle do not longer apply.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}} 2018)},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-13},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  pages = {1-7},\n  keywords = {PDR,Tx},\n  author = {To, Thanh-Hai and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SSLB3I38/To and Duda - 2018 - Simulation of LoRa in NS-3 Improving LoRa Perform.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":9,"created":1563984998782,"version":0,"updated":1563985949544},"$loki":2531},{"itemID":4694,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_project_,\n  title = {Project {{SMS}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/2YRAU2YB/Project SMS - sensors_app.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":9,"created":1563984998796,"version":0,"updated":1563985949802},"$loki":2532},{"itemID":5598,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{boufenneche_formal_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Formal {{Modeling}} of {{Greedy Behavior}} in {{Secure Internet}} of {{Things Networks}}},\n  abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, objects should communicate through secure wireless channels and would be able to connect to the Internet.

A question still requiring an answer is: are the IoT technologies usable to enhance traditional measurement systems, since they have been developed for a very similar objective? In this paper the use of a LoRa technology, originally developed for IoT, is investigated with the aim of implementing distributed measurement systems. After the conclusion that LoRa (Long Range) and LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network) architectures show a good match with measurement systems, the paper focuses on the characterization of time related performance indicators that are important for distributed systems. The experimental results show: the capability of low cost transceiver to schedule the transmission of frames with a standard uncertainty less than 3 {$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}s; and an acceptable long term clock stability (Allan Deviation) of commercial available devices (nodes and packet forwarders) for application like smart metering, structural health monitoring and process industry.},\n  number = {12},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

However, a flooding based routing protocol can address these challenges with its multipath characteristics. If the network uses a flooding based routing protocol, not only DATA but also ACK messages are transmitted through multiple paths. Although the messages are transmitted through multiple paths, we cannot avoid the packet loss completely. So, in order to provide high reliability of delivering messages, we need a retransmission mechanism. Though, if the network uses conventional transport layer protocol such as TCP, it will cause a spurious retransmission problem because it was not designed for the multipath environment. To overcome this problem, we suggest Path Similarity based Spurious Retransmission Minimization over Flooding based Routing in UWSN.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-01-18},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {17-24},\n  author = {Jones, Tyler and Dali, Aniket and Rao, Manoj Ramesh and Biradar, Neha and Madassery, Jean and Liu, Kaikai},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/LPZF5AGW/Jones et al_2018_Towards a Layered and Secure Internet-of-Things Testbed via Hybrid Mesh.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985001518,"version":0,"updated":1563985949162},"$loki":2567},{"itemID":3775,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{richardson_rpl_2018,\n  title = {{{RPL}}- {{Routing}} over {{Low Power}} and {{Lossy Networks}}},\n  url = {https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/94/slides/slides-94-rtgarea-2.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-02-18},\n  date = {2018},\n  author = {Richardson, Michael},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/KQXYV8J2/slides-94-rtgarea-2.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985001534,"version":0,"updated":1563985949302},"$loki":2568},{"itemID":4472,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{baccelli_powering_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Powering the {{Internet}} of {{Things}} with {{RIOT}}: {{Why}}? {{How}}? {{What}} Is {{RIOT}}?},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Baccelli, Emmanuel and Schleiser, Kaspar},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/PYP3R48U/Baccelli and Schleiser - Powering the Internet of Things with RIOT Why Ho.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985001548,"version":0,"updated":1563985949676},"$loki":2569},{"itemID":5846,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{khalid_sensing_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Sensing and {{Utilization}} of {{Spectrum}} with {{Cooperation Interference}} for {{Full}}-{{Duplex Cognitive Radio Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Full duplex (FD) radios in cognitive radio (CR) networks enable secondary users (SUs) to perform sensing and transmission simultaneously, and improve the utilization of spectrum.

It is demonstrated that the self-interference, secondary transmit power, PU activity, number of cooperative users, and the sensing outcomes have a significant influence on the sensing and UoS performance.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Khalid, Waqas and Yu, Heejung},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6JHBP5XH/Khalid and Yu - Sensing and Utilization of Spectrum with Cooperati.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985001566,"version":0,"updated":1563985950792},"$loki":2570},{"itemID":5068,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@thesis{avilacampos_evaluacion_2017,\n  title = {Evaluaci\\'on Del Rango de Transmisi\\'on de {{LoRa}} Para Redes de Sensores Inal\\'ambricas Con {{LoRaWAN}} En Ambientes Forestales},\n  type = {B.S. thesis},\n  date = {2017},\n  author = {Avila Campos, Pablo Esteban},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/85XKGVWP/Avila Campos - 2017 - Evaluación del rango de transmisión de LoRa para r.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/C2QJP6SJ/po.es.en.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/PUQEAQ28/poL.es.en.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985001762,"version":0,"updated":1563985950110},"$loki":2571},{"itemID":5674,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_trajectory_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Trajectory {{Optimization}} of {{Energy Efficient FSOC}}-{{UAV}} with {{Atmospheric}} and {{Geometric Loss}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436588/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436588},\n  abstract = {This paper address the issues of optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using free-space optical communication (FSOC).

Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\\% of overall throughput, 15\\% of the time. (2) We quantify the effects of ten problems caused by the mechanics of existing protocols that are responsible for this throughput loss; and (3) We recommend best practices for using vehicular opportunistic connections. Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be significantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP.

However, the learning process of the existing federated learning platforms rely on the direct communication between the model owner, e.g., central cloud or edge server, and the mobile devices for transferring the model update. Such a direct communication may be energy inefficient or even unavailable in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider adopting the relay network to construct a cooperative communication platform for supporting model update transfer and trading. In the system, the mobile devices generate model updates based on their training data. The model updates are then forwarded to the model owner through the cooperative relay network. The model owner enjoys the learning service provided by the mobile devices. In return, the mobile devices charge the model owner certain prices. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission among the mobile devices that use the same relay node, the rational mobile devices have to choose their relay nodes as well as deciding on their transmission powers. Thus, we formulate a Stackelberg game model to investigate the interaction among the mobile devices and that between the mobile devices and the model owner. The Stackelberg equilibrium is investigated by capitalizing on the exterior point method. Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Feng, Shaohan and University, Nanyang Technological and Niyato, Dusit and University, Nanyang Technological and Wang, Ping and University, York and Kim, Dong In and University, Sungkyunkwan and Liang, Ying-Chang},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/9KYSTAAZ/Feng et al. - Joint Service Pricing and Cooperative Relay Commun.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985002104,"version":0,"updated":1563985951076},"$loki":2578},{"itemID":4840,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{farris_survey_21,\n  title = {A {{Survey}} on {{Emerging SDN}} and {{NFV Security Mechanisms}} for {{IoT Systems}}},\n  volume = {21},\n  issn = {1553-877X, 2373-745X},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8424018/},\n  doi = {10.1109/COMST.2018.2862350},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

In this paper we consider a scenario with a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas serving four users, clustered into two groups of two users each, equipped with a single antenna. This simple but relevant scenario allows to capture the main features of NOMA systems, where in each cluster the user having the best channel applies successive interference cancellation (SIC) to remove the signal intended for the other user in the same cluster, while the other user treats interference as noise. Moreover interference among the two clusters also is treated as additional noise. In this scenario we address the problem of beamformer design and power allocation for the four users with the aim of minimizing the total transmit power while satisfying a minimum rate constraint for each user. Starting from the zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) beamformers we propose five solutions based on suitable combinations of fixed beamformers to simplify the beamformer design and power allocation. The performance of the proposed solutions is compared in terms of total consumed power and complexity of the various solutions.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {370-375},\n  author = {Piccoli, Carlo and Tomasin, Stefano and Jorswieck, Eduard},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/RV434KSC/Piccoli et al. - 2018 - Beamformer Design and Power Allocation for Two-Clu.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985002672,"version":0,"updated":1563985950584},"$loki":2586},{"itemID":3403,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{lee_vehicular_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Vehicular Cloud Networking: Architecture and Design Principles},\n  volume = {52},\n  issn = {0163-6804},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6736756/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MCOM.2014.6736756},\n  shorttitle = {Vehicular Cloud Networking},\n  abstract = {Over the past several decades, VANET has been a core networking technology to provide safety and comfort to drivers in vehicular environments.

Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa.

On the physical layer, simulation results show that an ultra narrowband network has a larger coverage, while wideband spread spectrum networks are less sensitive to interference. When considering the contention between nodes and interference between different networks, simulations show that adaptation of frequency and modulation is imperative for efficiently dealing with varying contention and interference in long range unlicensed networks.

That is why, IoT is presently spanning over a diverse range of applications in the fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, military, industry, etc. The resources IoT requires in those applications are heterogeneous in nature, for example, storage, processor, network, sensor nodes, energy, etc. The obvious challenge is how to manage these limited resources efficiently. Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed.

Wireless body area networks (WBAN) technology has gained popularity over the last few years, with a wide range of applications covered, in particular in health and rehabilitation. Wearable and pervasive computing are able to sense, monitor and process the data to provide smart assistance and context-aware ambient intelligence environments. However present-day WBAN devices are mainly battery-powered and due to energy issue they need to be recharged every day or even hours and thus they miss the expectations for a truly unobtrusive user experience. This work presents a novel energy-efscient asynchronous MAC protocol using a nano-watt wake up radio with addressing capabilities to reduce the energy consumption of the communication and then extend the WBAN life time. We present the benests of the wake up radio in a star topology widely used in WBAN where the number of the node is around 5 to 10. The implemented protocol exploiting the low power consumption of the wake up radio, the low latency and the addressing capabilities can increase signiscantly the energy efsciency of the single node and entire network reducing both idle listening and data collisions. Result based on measured power consumption and OMNET++ simulation demonstrate that by using the wake up radio it is possible to reduce the power consumption up to 150 times compared to related protocols and the lifetime can be signiscantly increased in a real world scenario.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 6th {{IEEE International Workshop}} on {{Advances}} in {{Sensors}} and {{Interfaces}} ({{IWASI}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 6th {{International Workshop}} on {{Advances}} in {{Sensors}} and {{Interfaces}} ({{IWASI}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2015-06},\n  pages = {228-233},\n  author = {{Trong Nhan Le} and Pegatoquet, Alain and Magno, Michele},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6FXWF28M/Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/DZBKNYE4/Trong Nhan Le et al. - 2015 - Asynchronous on demand MAC protocol using wake-up .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985005202,"version":0,"updated":1563985949972},"$loki":2612},{"itemID":5816,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{binh_delay_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Delay {{Analysis}} of {{Fixed Multi}}-{{Thread Algorithm}} for {{DBA}} in {{Long Reach PON}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437005/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437005},\n  abstract = {Long-Reach PON (LR-PON) is a broadband access network using passive optical network (PON) technology which the reach is extended to 100 km or higher.

However, routing in IP networks are relatively inflexible. Flows can follow only shortest paths toward their destinations. In contrast, Software Defined Networking (SDN) offers finegrained control over routing, at the expense of controller overhead, failover latency, and deployment challenges. The best choice is to combine both approaches to achieve ``central control over the distributed route computation'' paradigm. Recently a new idea called Fibbing is proposed to realize flexible fine-grained control in conventional IP networks. Fibbing as an alternative loop-free destination based solution brings the flexibility for traditional networks without changing router configurations and/or protocols. The Fibbing controller can steer a traffic flow to follow any specific route. However, how to achieve traffic engineering through dynamic traffic monitoring and route computation is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a framework to achieve an optimized load balancing solution for a Fibbing controlled network. In our system, there are a light weight traffic monitoring module, a demand estimation module, and an optimization engine for routing path computation.

WiFi fingerprinting, which estimates the user's locations using precollecting WiFi signals as references, is of particular interest since these days, every user can easily access to WiFi networks. Among numerous methods, deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods have shown an attractive performance but their major drawback is the sensitivity to the fluctuation of received signals (caused by multipaths). To yield a satisfactory performance, thus, a sufficiently large number of possible cases should be trained, which costs a lot. In this paper, we address the above problem by presenting a convolutional neural network (CNN) based localization method. As success in image classifications, the proposed method can be robust to the small changes of received signals as it exploits the topology of a radio map as well as signal strengths. Via experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed CNN method can outperform the other DNN-based methods using publicly available datasets provided in IPIN 2015.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {753-758},\n  author = {Jang, Jin-Woo and Hong, Song-Nam},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6SBBE9FP/Jang and Hong - 2018 - Indoor Localization with WiFi Fingerprinting Using.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985005554,"version":0,"updated":1563985950902},"$loki":2618},{"itemID":3766,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_contiki_2016,\n  title = {Contiki {{6LoWPAN Quick Guide}}},\n  date = {2016},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/YGMRK6AB/en.stsw-contiki6lp_quick_guide.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985005798,"version":0,"updated":1563985949296},"$loki":2619},{"itemID":4945,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{guntupalli_energy_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Energy {{Efficient Consecutive Packet Transmissions}} in {{Receiver}}-{{Initiated Wake}}-{{Up Radio Enabled WSNs}}},\n  volume = {18},\n  issn = {1530-437X, 1558-1748, 2379-9153},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8335796/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JSEN.2018.2825540},\n  abstract = {In wake-up radio (WuR)-enabled wireless sensor networks, data communication among nodes is triggered in an on-demand manner, by either a sender or a receiver.

In this paper, we propose a receiver-initiated consecutive packet transmission WuR (RI-CPT-WuR) medium access control (MAC) protocol, which eliminates multiple competitions to achieve higher energy efficiency. Furthermore, we develop two associated discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs) for evaluating the performance of RI-CPT-WuR and an existing RI-WuR MAC protocol. Using the solutions from the DTMC models, closed-form expressions for network throughput, average delay, packet reliability ratio, energy consumption and lifetime, and energy efficiency for both protocols are obtained.

For each unit, we simultaneously capture chessboard images and their three-dimensional (3D) point data at a few different orientations. Twodimensional (2D) chess corners are reprojected into 3D space for plane fitting. RANSAC algorithm is applied on LIDAR points before they are used for plane fitting. The mutual rotation between the camera and LIDAR is calculated by aligning the normal vectors of plane fitting results. An arbitrary point from the camera plane is projected on to the LIDAR plane and the distance is minimized to estimate the mutual translation.

In Malaysia, the statistics reveal that residential energy consumption has been on a steady increase due to the growing population as well as a lack of awareness within households regarding proper energy utilization that causes significant amount of energy wastage.

The application of intelligence in IoT, known as Cognitive IoT (CIoT), will enable decision making based on historical data, and automatically train, learn and troubleshoot future issues. This project proposes a smart energy monitoring system for home appliances incorporating CIoT which consists of three parts. Firstly, a Raspberry Pi-based smart plug serving as the gateway, that is able to read current data from individual home appliances, load the trained model from training server and test the verified data using the model. Secondly, Google Colab as the training server will be used to store the training data set and building the Tensorflow-based Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model. This recurrent neural network model will forecast electricity bill and notify users if abnormal energy consumption of individual home appliances is detected. Thirdly, a dashboard using Matplotlib library where users may monitor the real-time energy consumption. The completed LSTM model demonstrates a high accuracy of more than 80\\%, where a low mean squared error with train score = 0.1798 and test score = 0.1229 is determined.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016-10-21},\n  author = {family=Heijden, given=Rens W., prefix=van der, useprefix=true and Dietzel, Stefan and Leinm\\\"uller, Tim and Kargl, Frank},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W67H3GPW/van der Heijden et al_2016_Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation.pdf},\n  note = {00020}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985007178,"version":0,"updated":1563985949118},"$loki":2635},{"itemID":3457,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{ke_lora_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania}},\n  title = {A {{LoRa}} Wireless Mesh Networking Module for Campus-Scale Monitoring: Demo Abstract},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-4890-4},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3055031.3055034},\n  doi = {10.1145/3055031.3055034},\n  shorttitle = {A {{LoRa}} Wireless Mesh Networking Module for Campus-Scale Monitoring},\n  abstract = {LoRa, an emerging wireless technology, is examined for long range communication performance in a large area. Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals.

Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we fill this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system specifically devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios. Our experiments confirm what has been observed before in theory and simulation, i.e., the use of such a system can reduce, by as much as 40\\%, the amount of vehicles involved in highway pileups.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

To achieve low power consumption, every node periodically schedules its radio transceiver into sleep or active state, which is usually called duty cycle mechanism in MAC protocol. In this paper, we design a novel Prediction-Based Asynchronous MAC protocol (PBA-MAC) for heavy traffic load in wireless sensor networks. PBA-MAC applies an efficient wakeup mechanism to save the energy of a sensor node as much as possible. It reduces communication cost by enabling a sender to predict the intended receiver's wakeup time, without introducing unnecessary idle listening or overhearing cost. In addition, it introduces an exponential advance mechanism to handle the prediction error caused by clock drift and hardware platform latency. More importantly, its backcast-based retransmission characteristic can efficiently resolve severe wireless collisions caused by concurrent traffic flows. The PBA-MAC is implemented in Contiki operating system. We compare PBA-MAC to some existing energy-efficient MAC protocols. The experimental results show that PBAMAC significantly improves network energy efficiency and reduces packet delivery latency even under heavy traffic load.},\n  journaltitle = {AEU - International Journal of Electronics and Communications},\n  shortjournal = {AEU - Int.

Many Electronic Control Units (ECUs) have been installed in the vehicle to support ADAS, and massive data stream flows over the in-vehicle network. Therefore, the Ethernet backbone, which can guarantee the high bandwidth, has emerged as an in-vehicle communication technology. However, security on automotive Ethernet has not yet been proposed. The IEEE MACsec with IEEE 802.1X Authentication and Key Management (AKM) may be applied for the in-vehicle secure communication, but it has a constraint that its security scope is based on a point-to-point approach. Whenever a frame arrives at the switches in the transmission path, the decryption and reencryption of the frame are repeated. It may adversely affect the performance of ADAS related to the driver's safety by increasing the end-to-end latency. We therefore propose a new MACsec extension over the Software-Defined Networks (SDN) for an invehicle secure communication, which is based on IEEE 802.1X authentication mechanism. The proposed scheme extends the security scope of MACsec from point-to-point to end-to-end by delegating AKM process of ECUs and switches to SDN controller. It could minimize the cryptographic processes of the ECUs and switches without any modification of the existing MACsec standard, and could protect an automotive system from any manipulation by unauthorized third parties.

Third, we can see that the vegetable yields is maximum when the CO2 level is approximately 870 to 900 (ppm), and the vegetable yield is the maximum when the humidity is 93 to 95 (\\%), but when the temperature is between 16 and 18 (\\textcelsius{}), there is no significant difference in vegetable yields.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Cho, Wanhyun and Na, Myung-Hwan and Park, Yuha},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/9C8IXHAW/Cho et al. - Predicting the Yields of Field Vegetable Using the.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985008546,"version":0,"updated":1563985950812},"$loki":2649},{"itemID":5917,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_consideration_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Consideration of {{Constraints}} in {{Communication Terminal Devices Due}} to an {{Installed Environment}} of {{Sensor Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436967/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436967},\n  abstract = {Sensors are used to obtain information from a controlled target.

The most important challenge is to reduce power consumption when receivers are idle, the so called idle-listening cost. One approach proposes switching off the main receiver, then introduces new wake-up circuitry capable of detecting an incoming transmission, optionally discriminating the packet destination using addressing, then switching on the main radio only when required. This wake-up receiver technology represents the ultimate frontier in low power radio communication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review of the research progress in wake-up radio (WuR) hardware and relevant networking software. First, we present an overview of the WuR system architecture, including challenges to hardware design and a comparison of solutions presented throughout the last decade.

For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area. Such a correlation can be exploited to integrate and extend existing air pollution monitoring networks.

The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa configuration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the traffic intensity. The comparison shows the benefits of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its configuration according to its link budget.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-30},\n  date = {2018-10},\n  pages = {192-199},\n  author = {Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Suraty, Luiz and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/CN8P8U28/Ochoa et al. - 2018 - Large Scale LoRa Networks From Homogeneous to Het.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985009310,"version":0,"updated":1563985949432},"$loki":2656},{"itemID":4698,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_vehicular_b,\n  title = {Vehicular {{Networks C2X}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/YKYTDQ7S/Vehicular_Networks_C2X.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985009320,"version":0,"updated":1563985949808},"$loki":2657},{"itemID":4793,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{ezdiani_wireless_2017,\n  title = {Wireless {{Sensor Network Softwarization}}: {{Towards WSN Adaptive QoS}}},\n  volume = {4},\n  issn = {2327-4662},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017403/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JIOT.2017.2740423},\n  shorttitle = {Wireless {{Sensor Network Softwarization}}},\n  number = {5},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Internet of Things Journal},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Internet Things J.},\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2017-10},\n  pages = {1517-1527},\n  author = {Ezdiani, Syarifah and Acharyya, Indrajit S. and Sivakumar, Sivaramakrishnan and Al-Anbuky, Adnan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/7UNSZ5ZP/Ezdiani et al_2017_Wireless Sensor Network Softwarization.pdf},\n  note = {00011}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985009344,"version":0,"updated":1563985949918},"$loki":2658},{"itemID":4977,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{farooq_analyzing_2018,\n  title = {Analyzing {{LoRa}}: {{A}} Use Case Perspective},\n  shorttitle = {Analyzing {{LoRa}}},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE}} 4th {{World Forum}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{WF}}-{{IoT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {355--360},\n  author = {Farooq, Muhammad Omer and Pesch, Dirk},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/5PEYWXCC/Farooq_Pesch_2018_Analyzing LoRa.pdf},\n  note = {00005}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985009622,"version":0,"updated":1563985950052},"$loki":2659},{"itemID":5616,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{moon_hybrid_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Hybrid {{Precoding}} with {{Power Allocation}} for {{NR MIMO}}\\textendash{{OFDM Systems}}},\n  abstract = {The International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector has established the concept of 5G communication, and is actively developing new radio (NR) standards for 5G applications, which have evolved significantly over existing long-term evolution standards.

The experimental results shows that using canny edge detector after enhancing the image by contourlet transform along with an enhancement function, the brain MRI image can be segmented very efficiently which can outperforms other conventional methods.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {798-800},\n  author = {Akter, Lata Ayesha and Kwon, Goo-Rak},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/I7JEXQZK/Akter and Kwon - 2018 - Integration of Contourlet Transform and Canny Edge.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985010028,"version":0,"updated":1563985950936},"$loki":2666},{"itemID":3978,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_contiki_c,\n  title = {Contiki: {{MQTT}}-and-{{CoAP}}},\n  url = {http://www.cea-iot.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Day-4-Contiki-MQTT-and-CoAP.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-04-19},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/R4E9RSXH/Day-4-Contiki-MQTT-and-CoAP.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985010220,"version":0,"updated":1563985949408},"$loki":2667},{"itemID":4369,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{mehdipourataee_improved_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An {{Improved Abstract State Machine Based Choreography Specification}} and {{Execution Algorithm}} for {{Semantic Web Services}}},\n  volume = {2018},\n  issn = {1058-9244, 1875-919X},\n  url = {https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2018/4094951/},\n  doi = {10.1155/2018/4094951},\n  abstract = {We identify significant weaknesses in the original Abstract State Machine (ASM) based choreography algorithm of Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO), which make it impractical for use in semantic web service choreography engines.

Edge Computing for mobile networks is a new technology which is currently under standardization providing an IT service environment and cloud-computing capabilities at the edge of the mobile network in close proximity to the mobile end users. The aim of this technology is to reduce latency, ensure highly efficient network operation and service delivery, providing improved user experience. All of these can be translated into value and can create opportunities for operators, application and content providers enabling them to better utilize the mobile broadband capabilities. Furthermore, edge computing enables a new value chain for end users but also for industries allowing to efficient deliver their applications over the mobile network providing fresh business opportunities and new use cases. FEC is a feedback free error recovery method where the sender introduces redundant data in advance with the source data enabling the recipient to recover from different arbitrary packet losses. Recently, the adoption of FEC error control method has been boosted by the introduction of the powerful RaptorQ Application Layer FEC (AL-FEC) codes. In this work we propose the integration of ALFEC error protection application at the edge layer. We propose a novel AL-FEC application architecture scheme based on RaptorQ codes and we analyze the performance enhancements such an error control architecture can introduce on Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN)-edge computing integrated systems.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {364-369},\n  author = {Bouras, Christos and Kanakis, Nikolaos},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WGUJZJF4/Bouras and Kanakis - 2018 - AL-FEC Application on NGMN-Edge Computing Integrat.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985010280,"version":0,"updated":1563985950582},"$loki":2669},{"itemID":5950,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{tulkinbekov_cleveldb_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{CLeveldb}}: {{Coalesced Leveldb}} for {{Small Data}}},\n  abstract = {This paper proposes a coalesced key-value pairs generation technique for CLeveldb.

This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  pages = {880-885},\n  author = {Alvear, Oscar and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan-Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3Y6VC32N/Alvear et al_2015_Validation of a vehicle emulation platform supporting OBD-II communications.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985010506,"version":0,"updated":1563985949124},"$loki":2671},{"itemID":5653,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{datta_virtual_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Virtual {{Reality Mobile Application Testing}} in a {{5G Testbed}}},\n  abstract = {This paper describes an experiment for a Virtual Reality (VR) mobile application testing in a 5G testbed.

In this paper, the performance of a LDPC code is evaluated in this harsh channel environment. At the same time, in order to improve the system performance further, an interleaving method in combination with a LDPC code is used to overcome the burst error problem, which frequently occurs in optical satellite communication systems (OSC).

It can help or provide packet forwarding and other network functions. With the development of Internet and the emergence of software-defined networking (SDN), the methods designed for the traditional 5-dimensional rule set is not sufficient to process the current rule set that contains rules of 12 or more dimensions. The main problem is to process the rule sets of 12 or more dimensions in high throughput. To achieve high throughput, we study the implementations on GPU where some use a single hash table and others use Binary Range Tree to process the searching. In 12dimensional rule sets defined by OpenFlow 1.0, 8 fields are in the format of exact value or wildcard, and so using the single hash table or binary range tree is not efficient. Another problem to implement packet classification on GPU is that we must transfer the input data and results via the PCI-E bus that will incur long bus latency. In this paper, we propose a modified hash table to process the fields that contain only exact value or wildcard, and use the compressing method to reduce memory consumption. On the other hand, we implement the proposed method on APU that uses Heterogeneous System Architecture to skip the bus latency. According to the experimental results on AMD A107850 APU, our method can achieve the throughput of 1814 MPPS, and can support the rule sets of more than 12K 12-dimensional rules.

In this scheme, core switch only uses one field to perform lookup. In order to reduce the number of rules in edge switches, we encode the output port number of the last hop into MPLS field. We also propose a scheme to minimize the number of rules in fat-tree topology. In our scheme, the number of rules in core and aggregation switches is the same as the number of ports.

Although WuR exhibits its superiority for light traffic, it is inefficient to handle high traffic load in a network. This paper makes an effort towards improving the performance of WuR under diverse load conditions with a twofold contribution. We first propose three protocols that support variable traffic loads by enabling respectively clear channel assessment (CCA), backoff plus CCA, and adaptive WuC transmissions. These protocols provide various options for achieving reliable data transmission, low latency, and energy efficiency for ultra-low power consumption applications. Then, we develop an analytical framework based on an M/G/1/2 queue to evaluate the performance of these WuR protocols.

In the proposed wireless MIMO switch, the stations whose number is the number of antennas plus one access the relay. As a result, the relay station hardly decodes each information owing to the overloaded access. In each station, firstly, one information signal is decoded by the interference cancellation of its own signal and the zero forcing of relay filter.

This aggravates the already over-congested unlicensed radio bands, calling for new mechanisms to improve spectrum management and energy efficiency, such as transmission power control. Existing protocols are based on simplistic heuristics that often approach interference problems (i.e., packet loss, delay and energy waste) by increasing power, leading to detrimental results. The scope of this work is to investigate how machine learning may be used to bring wireless nodes to the lowest possible transmission power level and, in turn, to respect the quality requirements of the overall network. Lowering transmission power has benefits in terms of both energy consumption and interference. We propose a protocol of transmission power control through a reinforcement learning process that we have set in a multi-agent system. The agents are independent learners using the same exploration strategy and reward structure, leading to an overall cooperative network. The simulation results show that the system converges to an equilibrium where each node transmits at the minimum power while respecting high packet reception ratio constraints. Consequently, the system benefits from low energy consumption and packet delay.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2018-01-27},\n  pages = {375},\n  author = {Chincoli, Michele and Liotta, Antonio},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/G6JTECZ2/Chincoli and Liotta - 2018 - Self-Learning Power Control in Wireless Sensor Net.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985012028,"version":0,"updated":1563985949518},"$loki":2688},{"itemID":5773,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{wang_session_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Session {{Key Agreement}} for {{End}}-to-{{End Security}} in {{Time}}-{{Synchronized Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436968/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436968},\n  abstract = {Time synchronization is important for many network applications.

However, since there is a limit in the frequency resource, it has become very important to improve the spectral efficiency. In-Band Full Duplex (IBFD) systems can improve spectral efficiency up to 2 times.

Considering this existing gap in the Internet of Things (IoT) area, this paper proposes a mechanism for discovering, connecting, and identifying heterogeneous Bluetooth-enabled IoT devices of unknown device type, in order to be integrated into different platforms. This mechanism implements three (3) stages to successfully identify an unknown device. Initially, the discovery and the connection of both known and unknown devices take place so as to retrieve explicitly required specifications of these devices. Sequentially, the measurement of the syntactic similarity of all the devices' specifications and the comparison among the derived results occurs. Based on these results, the estimation of the overall syntactic similarity takes place, identifying finally the device type of the connected unknown devices. The prototype associated with this paper provides an example of this mechanism, demonstrating in detail each stage.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Mavrogiorgou, Argyro and Kiourtis, Athanasios and Touloupou, Marios and Kyriazis, Dimosthenis},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HGKYKZZK/Mavrogiorgou et al. - Identification of Bluetooth-Enabled IoT Devices Th.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985012592,"version":0,"updated":1563985950250},"$loki":2697},{"itemID":6355,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{chen_efficient_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Efficient {{Image Transmission Using LoRa Technology In Agricultural Monitoring IoT Systems}}},\n  abstract = {Reliable image transmission using LoRa in IoT monitoring systems is considered to be challenging due to insufficient LoRa data rate and payload size.

Furthermore we verified that the peak data rate of MHN-E system is over 5Gbps throughput without SFMF (Single Frequency Multi Flow) in outdoor environment.},\n  pages = {5},\n  author = {Cho, Dae-Soon and Kim, Junhyeong and Kim, Ilgyu},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/KBMA7N3H/Cho et al. - Outdoor Demonstration of 5Gbps MHN Enhanced System.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985013638,"version":0,"updated":1563985950988},"$loki":2710},{"itemID":5594,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{wang_socialaware_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Social-{{Aware Routing}} for {{Multi}}-Hop {{D2D Communication}} in {{Relay Cellular Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a promising technology for 5G mobile communication networks due to several benefits such as highly increased spectral efficiency, extended coverage, reduced latency, and enhanced cost and power efficiency.

In this paper, a socialaware routing algorithm is proposed to design the multi-hop path in the cellular network. Based on the Friis transmission equation, we drive the received power distribution and construct a relay cellular network. In addition, the congested ratio and average congested intensity are important indices to measure network congestion. To investigate the impact of network congestion on the end-to-end delay, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in three different congested ratio networks. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm in terms of reducing the end-to-end delay.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Wang, Sai and Shin, Oh-Soon and Shin, Yoan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/JAI4N82F/Wang et al. - Social-Aware Routing for Multi-hop D2D Communicati.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985013860,"version":0,"updated":1563985950238},"$loki":2711},{"itemID":5690,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{hasan_fuzzy_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Fuzzy {{Logic Based Network Selection}} in {{Hybrid OCC}}/{{Li}}-{{Fi Communication System}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436719/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436719},\n  abstract = {For being highly energy efficient and inexpensive, the use of current commercial LEDs for transmitting data is considered as a significant milestone in the area of optical wireless communications. Light-fidelity (Li-Fi) and optical camera communications (OCC) are two latest technologies which use LED as transmitter, with PD and camera as receivers, respectively. Currently, Li-Fi is emerged as highly promising as it supports high data rate and security. But it suffers from some limitations, e.g., short communication distance, low signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) etc. OCC can overcome these limitations, but it only supports lower data rate. Therefore, to provide proper solution, we propose a hybrid OCC/Li-Fi system. We are not going to use both the technologies at the same time, rather access point is selected based on fuzzy logic, considering different application scenarios. Furthermore, at the end of this paper, the performance of the selection mechanism is discussed briefly.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {95-99},\n  author = {Hasan, Moh.

The existing OFDM scheme that maps symbols to subcarriers using an inverse fast Fourier transform (iFFT) operation uses a cyclic prefix (CP) to reduce inter-symbol interference in a multipath channel, which is a disadvantage of power and spectral efficiency respectively. Therefore, this paper aims to complement the existing shortcomings for next generation high-speed communication and to design more efficient MCM system. The proposed system uses IDWT (inverse discrete wavelet transform) operation instead of iFFT operation used in conventional OFDM. A wavelet transform is an operation that filters a signal using wavelet and scaling basis functions. Therefore, we compared the bit error rate (BER), spectral efficiency, and peak to average power ratio (PAPR) performance with the conventional OFDM system through the design of OFDM system based on wavelet transform. As a result, the conventional OFDM and wavelet-OFDM exhibited the same BER performance, and wavelet-OFDM using the Discrete Meyer wavelet had the same spectral efficiency as the conventional OFDM.

The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

To determine the mood vector of a music piece, a Support Vector regressor is created for arousal and valence each using features of a music piece. Then, the regressors predict a mood vector. To map a mood tags to its mood vector, we investigate the relationship between them based on tagging data retrieved from Last.fm.

Use of CCN in wireless environment can cause various issues such as re-transmissions, collisions, delay and link failure. One of the key issues that affects the performance of CCN is the management of Pending Interest Table (PIT). PIT stores each broadcasted Interest packet forwarded upstream towards the content provider and is purged either when the requested content is returned or the PIT Entry Lifetime (PEL) expires. The conventional method in CCN for PEL does not considering the network impairments such as channel error, and congestion. As a result, timeout occurs, and Interest packets are re-transmitted for the chunks that have been dropped or delayed. Due to limited size of storage in wireless CCN, all new incoming Interest packets (including retransmissions) affect the performance of network by bloating PIT. In this paper, therefore, we propose a scheme that purges the PIT entries quickly by prefetching the un-obtained content in advance.

In addition, the reduction of complexity is not effected by the punctured patterns, and the proposed incremental decoding is suitable for all punctured polar codes.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {512-514},\n  author = {Lee, Huang-Chang and Liao, Guan-Chun},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/U6895RJY/Lee and Liao - 2018 - Low Complexity Polar Code Decoder for HARQ Applica.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985016564,"version":0,"updated":1563985950646},"$loki":2739},{"itemID":5829,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kyunglee_efficient_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Efficient {{Slice Allocation}} for {{Novel 5G Services}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436824/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436824},\n  abstract = {The unprecedented growth of novel applications and tsunami of connected devices in the existing networks have forced the service operators to find novel solutions to fulfil the Quality of Service for end users.

This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance.

Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus.

In this paper we take the view that always using lowest energy paths may not be optimal from the point of view of network lifetime and long-term connectivity. To optimize these measures, we propose a new scheme called energy aware routing that uses sub-optimal paths occasionally to provide substantial gains. Simulation results are also presented that show increase in network lifetimes of up to 40\\% over comparable schemes like directed diffusion routing. Nodes also burn energy in a more equitable way across the network ensuring a more graceful degradation of service with time.},\n  eventtitle = {2002 {{IEEE Wireless Communications}} and {{Networking Conference Record}}. {{WCNC}} 2002},\n  booktitle = {2002 {{IEEE Wireless Communications}} and {{Networking Conference Record}}. {{WCNC}} 2002 ({{Cat}}. {{No}}.{{02TH8609}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2002},\n  pages = {350-355},\n  author = {Shah, R.C. and Rabaey, J.M.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/2SYQNEPK/Shah and Rabaey - 2002 - Energy aware routing for low energy ad hoc sensor .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985018002,"version":0,"updated":1563985949990},"$loki":2757},{"itemID":4948,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{polastre_versatile_2004,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Baltimore, MD, USA}},\n  title = {Versatile Low Power Media Access for Wireless Sensor Networks},\n  isbn = {978-1-58113-879-5},\n  url = {http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1031495.1031508},\n  doi = {10.1145/1031495.1031508},\n  abstract = {We propose B-MAC, a carrier sense media access protocol for wireless sensor networks that provides a flexible interface to obtain ultra low power operation, effective collision avoidance, and high channel utilization.

B-MAC supports on-the-fly reconfiguration and provides bidirectional interfaces for system services to optimize performance, whether it be for throughput, latency, or power conservation. We build an analytical model of a class of sensor network applications. We use the model to show the effect of changing B-MAC's parameters and predict the behavior of sensor network applications. By comparing B-MAC to conventional 802.11inspired protocols, specifically S-MAC, we develop an experimental characterization of B-MAC over a wide range of network conditions. We show that B-MAC's flexibility results in better packet delivery rates, throughput, latency, and energy consumption than S-MAC. By deploying a real world monitoring application with multihop networking, we validate our protocol design and model.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Petri Nets}} 1989},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {1990},\n  pages = {1-29},\n  author = {Marsan, M.

Generally, since a visible light communication system generally uses a luminance modulation method, when a plurality of LEDs transmit data at the same time, it is difficult to accurately detect each LED due to light scattering interference of an adjacent LED. To solve this problem, we proposed a spatial filtering technique to group multiple LEDs and to reduce the interference of grouped LED matrix.

While U-Bus Air is a time asynchronous wireless sensor network, packet collisions cause degradation of communication quality as the number of terminals increases. A previous research has been proposed, an appropriate transmission cycle control algorithm based on the estimated collision probability by using collected topology information at a Fusion Center (FC). By using this algorithm, the communication performance is improved by feedback from FC to each terminal. However, its communication overhead becomes large due to topology information and feedback packets, and communication efficiency is degraded. In order to solve this problem, we propose a method to autonomously control receiver beacon transmission interval by leveraging decentralized Q-Learning.

A lot of recent works have proved that an approach of caching at edge devices is efficient to reduce latency and alleviate backhaul load so that the probability to meet users' Quality of Service (QoS) is much higher. However, due to the selfishness of mobile users, it is hard to convince users to store contents for other users. In this regard, we consider the social connection between users in order to induce users to store contents for the social community. So, to implement the socially aware Device to Device (D2D) caching, we construct two types of graphs: i) physical D2D graph which is constructed based on users communication over D2D links and ii) logical social graph which is consist of a group of people who share the common interest. Then, we formulate socially aware D2D caching problem into Markov Decision Process (MDP). Additionally, we consider the distance and the social ties between users, and mobile devices' capacity to optimally store contents under the constraint that energy consumption of cellular link is much higher than D2D link. Finally, we solve the D2D caching problem by using Q-learning where the goal is to minimize the total energy consumption over Macrocell Base Station (MBS) and mobile devices.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Im, Han Yeo Reum and Thar, Kyi and Hong, Choong Seon},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/5BND8GHA/Im et al. - Q-Learning Based Social Community-Aware Energy Eff.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985019292,"version":0,"updated":1563985950686},"$loki":2773},{"itemID":5902,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{han_optical_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Optical {{Spectrum Estimation Technique}} for {{Optical Interference Cancellation}} in {{High Speed Transmission MISO}}-{{OCVLC Environment}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437046/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437046},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we have studied the multiple light source image sensing technology for high speed transmission in optical camera CCD sensor based visible light communication system. To improve transmission capacity in optical camera communications via image sensors, different data must be transmitted simultaneously from each LED. However, multiple LED light source environments for high-speed transmission can cause interference between adjacent LEDs. In this case, since the visible light communication system generally uses intensity modulation, when a plurality of LEDs transmit data at the same time, it is difficult to accurately detect the respective LEDs due to the light scattering interference of the adjacent LEDs. In order to solve these problems, we propose spectral estimation technique and pixel image signal processing technique for each LED. A threshold value is generated based on the center value of the spectrum at the center of each LED, and only the LED which is sensed above the reference value is recognized independently by the ISP. If the spectral level is below the center value, that LED is recognized as off because it is affected by the light spread of adjacent LEDs. This technique accurately recognizes multiple LED pixels and improves the total average bit error rate and throughput of the MISOOCVLC (Optical Camera Visible Light Communication) system.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {765-767},\n  author = {Han, Doohee and Lee, Kyujin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/56YUL4N3/Han and Lee - 2018 - Optical Spectrum Estimation Technique for Optical .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985019324,"version":0,"updated":1563985950916},"$loki":2774},{"itemID":4816,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{hamza_what_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {1. {{What}} Is {{Purple IoT}} ? 2. {{Architecture}} 3. {{Exploring Purple IoT}} 4. {{Concepts}} 5. {{Used Technologies}}},\n  pages = {20},\n  author = {Hamza, Jeljeli},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/Y95ILZ3R/Hamza - 1.

Recently, the concept of off-chain payments is introduced that led to the idea of establishing a payment network called Lightning Network (LN). Off-chain links provide the ability to do transactions without writing to Blockchain. However, LN's design still favors fees and is creating hub nodes that defeat the purpose of Blockchain. In addition, it is still not reliable as not all the transactions are guaranteed to be transmitted to their destinations. If current retailers would like to use it, these problems might hinder its adoption. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate creating a private payment network among a given set of retailers that will serve their business needs, just like the idea of private Blockchains. The goal is to build a pure peer-to-peer topology that will eliminate the need for relays and increase the robustness of payments. Using off-chain links as edges and retailers as nodes, the problem is formulated as a multi-flow commodity problem where transactions represent the commodities from various sources to destinations. As the multi-flow commodity problem is NP-Complete, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in a dynamic way by updating the edge weights when new payment paths are to be found. The order of transactions is randomized to provide fairness among the retailers. The evaluations indicate that the proposed heuristic comes close to an optimal solution while providing scalability and user privacy.},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Erdin, Enes and University, Florida International and Cebe, Mumin and University, Florida International and Akkaya, Kemal and University, Florida International and Bulut, Eyuphan and University, Virginia Commonwealth and Uluagac, A Selcuk and University, Florida International},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/2P2BQWCI/Erdin et al. - A Heuristic-Based Private Bitcoin Payment Network .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985019586,"version":0,"updated":1563985951036},"$loki":2778},{"itemID":3512,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{al-kashoash_comparison_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Comparison of {{6LoWPAN}} and {{LPWAN}} for the {{Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  volume = {13},\n  issn = {1448-837X, 2205-362X},\n  url = {https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1448837X.2017.1409920},\n  doi = {10.1080/1448837X.2017.1409920},\n  abstract = {By 2020, 50 billion devices (things) are expected to be connected to the Internet to form the Internet of Things (IoT) world. In general, two main categories of networks are used in the IoT: short-range and long-range low-power networks. IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities. Each network category has its unique characteristics and strengths and each category has its important role in the IoT world.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {Australian Journal of Electrical and Electronics Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Aust.

Different from network-centric approaches, the proposed framework takes advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and virtualization technology, which will bring better perceived services quality for wireless network users. In the proposed user-centric framework, control plane and data plane are decoupled to manage the HetNets in a flexible and coadjutant way, and resource virtualization technology is introduced to abstract physical resources of HetNets into unified virtualized resources.

A third party network can be a community network managed by its users, a Wi-Fi mesh network or a licensed band femtocell. Recently, many studies have emerged related to mobile data offloading.

To analyze the service selection of the secondary transmitters, we formulate the problem as an evolutionary game. Specifically, we model the service adaptation of the secondary transmitters by the replicator dynamics, and analytically prove that a unique evolutionary equilibrium is reached by the evolutionary game. Also, we prove that the evolutionary equilibrium is stable.

In EC substantial compute and storage resources are placed at the edge of the network, in close proximity to end users. Similarly, NDN provides an alternative to traditional host centric IP architecture which seems a perfect candidate for distributed computation. Although NDN with EC seems a promising approach for enabling future Internet, it can cause various challenges such as expiry time of the Pending Interest Table (PIT) and non-trivial computation of the edge node. In this paper we discuss the expiry time and non-trivial computation in NDN based EC. We argue that if NDN is integrated in EC, then the PIT expiry time will be affected in relation with the processing time on the edge node. Our analysis shows that integrating NDN in EC without considering PIT expiry time may result in the degradation of network performance in terms of Interest Satisfaction Rate.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Ullah, Rehmat and Rehman, Muhammad Atif Ur and Kim, Byung-Seo and Sonkoly, Balazs and Tapolcai, Janos},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/QLT7VWQD/Ullah et al. - On Pending Interest Table in Named Data Networking.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985021172,"version":0,"updated":1563985950280},"$loki":2799},{"itemID":5683,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bruni_dynamic_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Dynamic {{DetectinnTracking Switching}}},\n  abstract = {Advances in deep learning based object detection methods have achieve state-of-the-art detection accuracy in real-time using high-end GPUs.

Nevertheless, in practice, CR suffers from non-Gaussian noise such as man-made impulsive noise, ultra-wideband interference and co-channel interference. In this article, to handle the detection performance degradation in non-Gaussian impulsive noise environments, a robust spectrum sensing scheme namely hyperbolic tangent based energy detector (HT-ED) is proposed. The proposed HT-ED is a semi-blind method which does not require any a priori knowledge about the primary user's signals. Furthermore, the HT-ED can provide a superior detection performance compared with the conventional energy detector (ED) in a wide range of non-Gaussian noises. The simulation results show that the proposed HT-ED is very robust against impulsive noises which are modeled as the Laplace or {$\\alpha$}-stable noises. Moreover the detection performance of HT-ED is much better than those of the traditional ED and FLOM-based methods.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {283-288},\n  author = {Qu, Hua and Xu, Xiguang and Zhao, Jihong and Yan, Feiyu and Wang, Weihua},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/FSBLQQKF/Qu et al. - 2018 - Robust Spectrum Sensing Based on Hyperbolic Tangen.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985022520,"version":0,"updated":1563985950544},"$loki":2814},{"itemID":4061,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pham_faq_,\n  title = {{{FAQ}}.Pdf},\n  author = {{Pham}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ZIFQJL2R/FAQ.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985022718,"version":0,"updated":1563985949472},"$loki":2815},{"itemID":4663,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{mammeri_qualite_2005,\n  langid = {french},\n  title = {Qualit\\'e de service dans les r\\'eseaux},\n  date = {2005},\n  pages = {59},\n  author = {Mammeri, Zoubir},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/EU8W6U8S/Mammeri - 2005 - Qualité de service dans les réseaux.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985022732,"version":0,"updated":1563985949796},"$loki":2816},{"itemID":5851,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{do_image_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An Image Gradient Based {{LED}} Bit Detection Algorithm in Vehicular Optical Camera Communication},\n  abstract = {Information in vehicular optical camera communication (VOCC) systems is transmitted using LED arrays, which are also vehicle lights functioning both illumination and communication.

To solve this problem, a new optical transport network configuration solution must be studied. Therefore, the adoption of DWDM(Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) scheme, which is most advantageous for increasing the data capacity among the various optical communication network technologies proposed to date, is rapidly increasing.[1] However, because DWDM is advantageous in capacity, but requires a large number of wavelengths, DWDM SFP optical module inventory per channel can accumulate, leading to an increase in inventory costs.

UWB is known for its high position accuracy in localization.

In this paper, different localization algorithms for the UWB system were analytically reviewed. The performance of the localization algorithms is discussed in terms of root mean square and cumulative distribution function of localization errors.

For accurate positioning, VLP requires a signal from more than two transmitters. However, the signal from the minimum number of transmitters may not always be available especially in the area close to the walls leading to inaccurate positioning (the deadzone). The simulation for a typical industrial environment shows that the loss of a signal due to a dead-zone is highly dependent on the divergence angle of transmitters and the field of view of the receiver.

In the considered structure, the secondary base station (SB) can help relay the PS's signal via an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol, and a power splitting EH device is adopted at the PR. A cooperative strategy is proposed for maximizing the efficiency of the information and power transfer. We optimize two precoders at the SB (for the PS and SS, respectively) and the power splitting factor for the PR. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, it is a real challenge. To facilitate the optimization process, a precoding structure is first proposed to reduce the number of parameters. The resultant optimization problem can then be equivalently solved using a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach.

The sniffing SBCs are placed in a cycle around the sender so that every node has the same chance to receive the simulated packets from the SN. For the control of all 20 SBCs, a self-developed software is used, which connects from the host to the clients and is used for configuring the experiments.

The IoT vision is to extend the Internet into our everyday lives, so the number of connected devices and innovative applications are growing very fast to bring intelligence into\nas many domains as possible. The QoS for IoT application not only depends on the Internet network and communication\ninfrastructure, it is also impacted by the operation and performance of IoT sensing infrastructure. Therefore, the new QoS parameters such as data accuracy, sampling rate, and\ndevice availability become important for the IoT applications compared to the Internet applications. The huge number of the Internet-connected IoT devices and application, and the spontaneous traffic flow among them make the management of the quality of service complex\nacross the Internet infrastructure. On the other hand, the non-IP devices and their limited capabilities in terms of energy and transmission create the dynamic environment and hinder the direct interaction between devices and applications. The quality of service is becoming one of the critical non-functional IoT element which needs research and studies. A flexible and scalable QoS management mechanism must be implemented in IoT system to keep up with the growth rate of the Internet-connected IoT devices and applications as well as their heterogeneity and diversity. The solution should address the IoT application requirements and user satisfaction while considering the system dynamism, limitations, and characteristics. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networking which separates the control plane and the data plane of the network elements. It makes the network\nelements programmable via the centralized control plane. This approach enables more agile management and control over the network behavior. In this thesis, we take advantage of SDN technology as the future of the Internet to offer a\nflexible and adaptive QoS support scheme for the IoT services. We present an SDN-based middleware to define a QoS management framework to manage the application specific QoS\nneeds across the IoT infrastructure including transport and sensing network. Also, we propose a new QoS model that takes into account the application QoS preferences and the network\nelements status to allocate effectively the resources for the applications across SDN network while maximizing network performance.},\n  institution = {{\\'Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\\'eal}},\n  type = {masters},\n  urldate = {2019-04-11},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  author = {Meshinchi, Atefeh},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/BNHZ9XGG/Meshinchi_2018_QOS-Aware and Status-Aware Adaptive Resource Allocation Framework in SDN-Based.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985025922,"version":0,"updated":1563985949318},"$loki":2851},{"itemID":4727,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{george_reunion_2019,\n  title = {R\\'eunion {{Lancement Atelier}}\\_5\\_{{E3S}}-15 Mai 2019},\n  date = {2019},\n  author = {George, Laurent},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/EQTASLKP/Réunion Lancement Atelier_5_E3S-15 mai 2019 .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985025938,"version":0,"updated":1563985949820},"$loki":2852},{"itemID":4844,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{zarca_enhancing_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Enhancing {{IoT}} Security through Network Softwarization and Virtual Security Appliances},\n  volume = {28},\n  issn = {1099-1190},\n  url = {https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nem.2038},\n  doi = {10.1002/nem.2038},\n  abstract = {Billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are expected to populate our environments and provide novel pervasive services by interconnecting the physical and digital world. However, the increased connectivity of everyday objects can open manifold security vectors for cybercriminals to perform malicious attacks. These threats are even augmented by the resource constraints and heterogeneity of low-cost IoT devices, which make current host-based and static perimeter-oriented defense mechanisms unsuitable for dynamic IoT environments. Accounting for all these considerations, we reckon that the novel softwarization capabilities of Telco network can fully leverage its privileged position to provide the desired levels of security. To this aim, the emerging software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) paradigms can introduce new security enablers able to increase the level of IoT systems protection. In this paper, we design a novel policy-based framework aiming to exploit SDN/NFV-based security features, by efficiently coupling with existing IoT security approaches. A proof of concept test bed has been developed to assess the feasibility of the proposed architecture. The presented performance evaluation illustrates the benefits of adopting SDN security mechanisms in integrated IoT environments and provides interesting insights in the policy enforcement process to drive future research.},\n  number = {5},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Network Management},\n  shortjournal = {Int.

For example, public blockchains have been used to enable many different cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, existing public blockchains and smart contracts deployed on them may disclose sensitive information. Although there is some ongoing work that leverage advanced cryptography to address some of these sensitive information leakage issues, they require significant changes to existing and popular blockchains such as Ethereum and are usually computationally expensive. On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efficient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly. Given these observations, one natural question that arise is, can we leverage both public and private blockchain infrastructures to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and accountable applications ?

This paper presents an automated collaboration framework for emergency management that coordinates all stakeholders within the emergency response system and fully automates the rescue process. Applying the concept of multiaccess edge computing architecture, as well as choreography of the service oriented architecture, the system allows seamless coordination between multiple organizations in a distributed way through standard web services. A service choreography is designed to globally model the emergency management process from the time an accident occurs until the rescue is finished. The choreography can be synthesized to generate detailed specification on peer-to-peer interaction logic, and then the specification can be enacted and deployed on cloud infrastructures.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {1-13},\n  author = {Chen, Lei and Englund, Cristofer},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XUFTNMVT/Chen_Englund_2018_Every Second Counts.pdf},\n  note = {00007}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985026754,"version":0,"updated":1563985949582},"$loki":2859},{"itemID":4550,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{saravanan_smart_2017,\n  location = {{Geneva, Switzerland}},\n  title = {Smart Water Grid Management Using {{LPWAN IoT}} Technology},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-5873-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8016224/},\n  doi = {10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016224},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{Global Internet}} of {{Things Summit}} ({{GIoTS}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{Global Internet}} of {{Things Summit}} ({{GIoTS}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Saravanan, M and Das, Arindam and Iyer, Vishakh},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WVEPTR7C/Saravanan et al_2017_Smart water grid management using LPWAN IoT technology.pdf},\n  note = {00013}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985026786,"version":0,"updated":1563985949710},"$loki":2860},{"itemID":4790,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@incollection{song_improved_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Singapore}},\n  title = {Improved {{Energy Efficient Adaptive Clustering Routing Algorithm}} for {{WSN}}},\n  volume = {812},\n  isbn = {978-981-10-8122-4 978-981-10-8123-1},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-10-8123-1_8},\n  abstract = {Routing algorithm is the key to prolong the lifetime of the overall wireless sensor network.

Due to the ultra low power nature of these radio receivers, energy consumption and latency can be optimized at the same time. Energy consumption of the combined physical and MAC layer of a WUR based design is compared to efficient schedule based low power MAC protocols using the same main underlying transceiver without a wakeup radio receiver. WUR-MAC is based on proven MAC concepts but avoids complicated algorithms that are needed to synchronize nodes in traditional WSNs. Simulation results show that with typically low traffic, the average power consumption of schedule-based MACs is significantly higher than by using WUR-MAC only in the case where very low power Wakeup Receivers ({$<$}40 {$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}W always on) are used.

However, the limited bandwidth available for physical layer modulation in LoRa makes it unsuitable for high bit rate data transfer from devices like image sensors. In this paper, we propose a new method for mangrove forest monitoring in Malaysia, wherein we transfer image sensor data over the LoRa physical layer (PHY) in a node-to-node network model. In implementing this method, we produce a novel scheme for overcoming the bandwidth limitation of LoRa. With this scheme the images, which requires high data rate to transfer, collected by the sensor are encrypted as hexadecimal data and then split into packets for transfer via the LoRa physical layer (PHY). To assess the quality of images transferred using this scheme, we measured the packet loss rate, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) index of each image. These measurements verify the proposed scheme for image transmission, and support the industrial and academic trend which promotes LoRa as the future solution for IoT infrastructure.},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-07-02},\n  date = {2018-09-27},\n  pages = {3257},\n  author = {Jebril, Akram and Sali, Aduwati and Ismail, Alyani and Rasid, Mohd},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/GTVNDLS8/Jebril et al_2018_Overcoming Limitations of LoRa Physical Layer in Image Transmission.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985027148,"version":0,"updated":1563985950038},"$loki":2866},{"itemID":3762,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{rafikzitouni_lab2_,\n  title = {Lab2.Pdf},\n  author = {Rafik Zitouni},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/NUMA3V28/Lab2.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985027368,"version":0,"updated":1563985949290},"$loki":2867},{"itemID":3973,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{antoniolinan_contiki_2016,\n  title = {Contiki: {{Toolchain}}},\n  date = {2016},\n  author = {{Antonio Li\\~n\\'an}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XBG2KXSP/Day_1_-_Workshop_introduction1.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985027382,"version":0,"updated":1563985949400},"$loki":2868},{"itemID":4935,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{frenzel_what_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {What's {{The Difference Between IEEE}} 802.15.4 {{And ZigBee Wireless}}?},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Frenzel, Lou},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/KEJJUCIY/Frenzel - What’s The Difference Between IEEE 802.15.4 And Zi.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/KTMXV59S/Frenzel - What’s The Difference Between IEEE 802.15.4 And Zi.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985027398,"version":0,"updated":1563985949986},"$loki":2869},{"itemID":5562,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{nakazato_revenue_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Revenue {{Model}} with {{Multi}}-{{Access Edge Computing}} for {{Cellular Network Architecture}}},\n  abstract = {Due to the drastic growth in the number of devices connected to mobile networks, the demand for further expansion of the capacity of wireless communication is increasing.

The conventional cloud applications are deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) according to the application requirements and data traffic situations, and the users are controlled with out-ofband C-plane to connect to the surrounding MEC applications. For the installation of MEC in the heterogeneous cellular networks, to the best of authors knowledge, there is no research conducted on whether a business model can be established when additional fees are paid for MEC. In this paper, the authors attempt to introduce a new concept of ecosystem for MEC based on the combination of ultra-broadband mmWave communications.

Health state prediction as a service can be presented with a set of potential future states and over a number of years into the future.

This flexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage).

Duty cycling, however, does not eliminate idle listening, comes at the price of longer latencies and obtains lifetimes that are still insufficient for many critical applications. Using a wake-up receiver (WUR) allows actual communications on the main radio only for transmission or reception, virtually eliminating node idling. However, the range of current WUR prototypes is still significantly shorter than that of the main radio, which can challenge the use of existing WSN protocols in WUR-based networks. In this paper we present an approach to mitigate this limitation of wake-up-based networks. In particular, we show that the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP), a standard protocol for data gathering in WSNs, suitably redefined to work on WUR-endowed nodes, achieves lifetimes of several decades. This constitutes a remarkable improvement over duty cycle-based solutions, where CTP makes the network lasts only a handful of months. At the same time, our WUR-based approach obtains data latencies comparable to those obtained by keeping the main radio always on.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2016-02},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Basagni, Stefano and Petrioli, Chiara and Spenza, Dora},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/GP7HG8CE/Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/XM6RSEUR/Basagni et al. - 2016 - CTP-WUR The collection tree protocol in wake-up r.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985030248,"version":0,"updated":1563985949982},"$loki":2904},{"itemID":5768,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{su_sequential_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {A {{Sequential Auction Game}} for {{QoS}}-{{Aware User Association}} in {{Heterogeneous Cellular Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436793/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436793},\n  abstract = {This paper investigates the user association problem in downlink heterogeneous cellular networks.

We propose a valuation function formulation for participating buyers to respect user QoS requirements, and we introduce a game mechanism with unit demand buyers and myopic bidding strategies that encourages traffic offloading. Furthermore, we investigate the ordering of distinct users that provides an approximation to socially efficient outcomes. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and show significant rate gains for cell edge users.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {464-468},\n  author = {Su, Gongchao and Chen, Bin and Lin, Xiaohui and Wang, Hui},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/847AGNKT/Su et al. - 2018 - A Sequential Auction Game for QoS-Aware User Assoc.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985030278,"version":0,"updated":1563985950626},"$loki":2905},{"itemID":5860,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{lata_review_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Review}} on {{Broadcasting Protocols}} for {{Duty}}-{{Cycled Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Developments in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology have brought about a substantial number of applications.

However, because of this DC scheme network has to face more additional problems such as- transmission delay, low delivery rate, increasing number of transmission in case of broadcasting command to other nodes of the network etc. Many researches have been done in this field for solving those issues and many more are still going on.

Although blockchain technology has the potential to address these challenges through providing a tamper-proof audit trail of supply chain events and data associated with a product lifecycle, it does not solve the trust problem associated with the data itself. Reputation systems are an effective approach to solve this trust problem. However, current reputation systems are not suited to the blockchain based supply chain applications as they are based on limited observations, they lack granularity and automation, and their overhead has not been explored. In this work, we propose TrustChain, as a three-layered trust management framework which uses a consortium blockchain to track interactions among supply chain participants and to dynamically assign trust and reputation scores based on these interactions. The novelty of Trustchain stems from: (a) the reputation model that evaluates the quality of commodities, and the trustworthiness of entities based on multiple observations of supply chain events, (b) its support for reputation scores that separate between a supply chain participant and products, enabling the assignment of product-specific reputations for the same participant, (c) the use of smart contracts for transparent, efficient, secure, and automated calculation of reputation scores, and (d) its minimal overhead in terms of latency and throughput when compared to a simple blockchain based supply chain model.},\n  pages = {10},\n  author = {Malik, Sidra},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/Z8L8CC4N/Malik - TrustChain Trust Management in Blockchain and IoT.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985030878,"version":0,"updated":1563985951048},"$loki":2914},{"itemID":3142,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{david_uppaal_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Uppaal {{SMC}} Tutorial},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {1433-2779, 1433-2787},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10009-014-0361-y},\n  doi = {10.1007/s10009-014-0361-y},\n  abstract = {This tutorial paper surveys the main features of Uppaal SMC, a model checking approach in Uppaal family that allows us to reason on networks of complex real-timed systems with a stochastic semantic.

First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip\\- tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experiments for pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification are con\\- ducted independently and both methods achieve nearly 90\\% on classification.},\n  eventtitle = {2012 15th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}} - ({{ITSC}} 2012)},\n  booktitle = {2012 15th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2012-09},\n  pages = {67-72},\n  author = {Takahashi, Toshimitsu and Kim, HyungKwan and Kamijo, Shunsuke},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/M5JU9NJ4/Takahashi et al_2012_Urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and HMM.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985032318,"version":0,"updated":1563985949138},"$loki":2923},{"itemID":4385,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{shankarpandey_service_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Service {{Selection Based}} on {{Dominant Role}} of the {{Choreography}}},\n  volume = {7},\n  issn = {22307702, 09769811},\n  url = {http://www.aircconline.com/ijwsc/V7N1/7116ijwsc02.pdf},\n  doi = {10.5121/ijwsc.2016.7102},\n  abstract = {Web services are playing dominant role on Internet for e-business.

Accordingly, there are growing needs for UAS Traffic Management (UTM) systems. In this phenomenon, various communication protocols for UTM are emerging. In this paper, especially, the application of UTM system based on Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) protocol is introduced as one of most efficient and stable protocols in environments with high-speed mobility and dynamic changing topology. Furthermore, we design a network architecture that supports direct communication among UAVs as well as UAV and ground station within the UTM framework.

However, the RF algorithm has to input the number of the tree composing the forest as a parameter. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm that limit the number of trees composing the forest using the McNemar test. To evaluate the performance of the proposed RF algorithm, we compared learning time, accuracy and memory usage of the proposed algorithm with the original RF algorithm and other algorithm by using the KDDcup99 dataset.

Urban planners are looking for solutions to reduce traffic congestion. Realtime traffic information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and traffic control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}} ({{IMIS}})},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-06},\n  pages = {450-455},\n  author = {Kim, Wooseong and Gerla, Mario},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/U28YNY9U/Kim_Gerla_2011_NAVOPT.pdf},\n  note = {00022}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985033992,"version":0,"updated":1563985949148},"$loki":2943},{"itemID":4849,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{sama_servicebased_2016,\n  location = {{Washington, DC, USA}},\n  title = {*{{Service}}-{{Based Slice Selection Function}} for {{5G}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-1328-9},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7842265/},\n  doi = {10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842265},\n  eventtitle = {{{GLOBECOM}} 2016 - 2016 {{IEEE Global Communications Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{IEEE Global Communications Conference}} ({{GLOBECOM}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-19},\n  date = {2016-12},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Sama, Malla Reddy and Beker, Sergio and Kiess, Wolfgang and Thakolsri, Srisakul},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/NJ25WB7B/Sama et al_2016_Service-Based Slice Selection Function for 5G.pdf},\n  note = {00016}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985034018,"version":0,"updated":1563985949952},"$loki":2944},{"itemID":5688,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{yun_vehicular_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Vehicular {{Acceleration Advisory Algorithm Using V2V Communication}} in {{Highway Junction Point}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436985/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436985},\n  abstract = {The highway junction point, where the ramp is merged with the mainstream, is the main traffic congestion point in the highway when handling transport demands. A vehicle driving on the ramp generally attempts to enter the highway without predicting the traffic condition, and commonly causes traffic congestion on highways. Traffic congestion in the highway junction is defined as the traffic situation that the transport demand in the conjunction point exceeds the bottleneck capacity and the accumulated demand remains to the bottleneck. Under traffic congestion, vehicles driving on the ramp cannot efficiently enter the highway. As a result, the waiting time of the vehicle on the ramp becomes long, and fuel consumption and CO2 emission increase due to the frequent acceleration and deceleration. In this paper, we propose a vehicular speed acceleration advisory algorithm for the vehicle on the ramp at the junction point. By recognizing the traffic condition on highways using V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication, the proposed algorithm helps to reduce the frequent acceleration and deceleration by drivers. From the simulation results, compared to the conventional driving on the ramp, we show that the proposed algorithm can decrease fuel consumption, CO2 emission under various vehicle densities.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {85-88},\n  author = {Yun, Kwang-Wook and Kim, Hyeong-Geon and Kwon, Joonho and Jeong, Han-You and Choi, Yoon-Ho},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/VWPDMM55/Yun et al. - 2018 - Vehicular Acceleration Advisory Algorithm Using V2.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985034052,"version":0,"updated":1563985950452},"$loki":2945},{"itemID":5805,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kwon_study_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Study}} on {{Verification System}} to {{Support Efficient Interface Test}} in {{Embedded System}}},\n  abstract = {In recent years, embedded systems such as various electronic devices equipped with a microprocessor, which acts as a brain of electronic devices, have been spreading due to the improvement of computational capability of system semiconductors and the generalization of large-capacity memory.

The big data transmitted to the cloud or fog will consume massive network bandwidth. This may result in the IoT network easily encountering network congestion. Moreover, there are IoT applications that need to transfer multimedia data with multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements. A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed. The AQRA improves the average end-to-end flow performance by 10.75\\%, 11.88\\% and 10.82\\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively.

CayleyMenger determinant is mostly used when the beacon and deployed sensors are in the state of parallel planes. We have, however, proposed a mathematical model to compute the coordinates of the submerged sensors even when these sensors and beacon are in non-parallel state configuration. As the knowledge of precise coordinates of the sensors is as important as the collected data in underwater wireless sensor networks, the measure of exact distance between the nodes becomes the prime factor for improved accuracy. The proposed mathematical model of coordinate-determination has better immunity from multipath fading and linearization process of non-linear equations, resulting in more precise location of the sensors. Moreover, a single beacon is used to determine the coordinates of the sensor nodes where none of them have a priori knowledge about their locations.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {525-530},\n  author = {Rahman, Anisur and Muthukkumarasamy, Vallipuram},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SK4CDLGZ/Rahman and Muthukkumarasamy - 2018 - Localization of Submerged Sensors with a Single Be.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985034332,"version":0,"updated":1563985950654},"$loki":2949},{"itemID":6056,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{amiri_sharding_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {On {{Sharding Permissioned Blockchains}}},\n  abstract = {Permissioned Blockchain systems rely mainly on Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols to establish consensus on the order of transactions.

To utilize such extra resources, in this paper we introduce a model that leverages transaction parallelism by partitioning the nodes into clusters (partitions) and processing independent transactions on different partitions simultaneously. The model also shards the blockchain ledger, assigns different shards of the blockchain ledger to different clusters, and includes both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions. Since more than one cluster is involved in each cross-shard transaction, the ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Amiri, Mohammad Javad},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/VQP6HZQQ/Amiri - On Sharding Permissioned Blockchains.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985034346,"version":0,"updated":1563985951032},"$loki":2950},{"itemID":4373,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{muram_framework_2017,\n  location = {{Honolulu, HI, USA}},\n  title = {Towards a {{Framework}} for {{Detecting Containment Violations}} in {{Service Choreography}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-2005-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8034982/},\n  doi = {10.1109/SCC.2017.29},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Services Computing}} ({{SCC}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Services Computing}} ({{SCC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {172-179},\n  author = {Muram, Faiz UL and Javed, Muhammad Atif and Tran, Huy and Zdun, Uwe},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/4SJG8ZTL/Muram et al_2017_Towards a Framework for Detecting Containment Violations in Service Choreography.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985034552,"version":0,"updated":1563985949588},"$loki":2951},{"itemID":4584,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{grassi_navigo_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Boston, MA, USA}},\n  title = {Navigo: {{Interest}} Forwarding by Geolocations in Vehicular {{Named Data Networking}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8461-9},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7158165/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WoWMoM.2015.7158165},\n  shorttitle = {Navigo},\n  eventtitle = {2015 {{IEEE}} 16th {{International Symposium}} on \"{{A World}} of {{Wireless}}, {{Mobile}} and {{Multimedia Networks}}\" ({{WoWMoM}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE}} 16th {{International Symposium}} on {{A World}} of {{Wireless}}, {{Mobile}} and {{Multimedia Networks}} ({{WoWMoM}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-30},\n  date = {2015-06},\n  pages = {1-10},\n  author = {Grassi, Giulio and Pesavento, Davide and Pau, Giovanni and Zhang, Lixia and Fdida, Serge},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MQF8J5RG/Grassi et al. - 2015 - Navigo Interest forwarding by geolocations in veh.pdf},\n  note = {00122}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985034580,"version":0,"updated":1563985949770},"$loki":2952},{"itemID":5617,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bae_distributed_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Distributed {{Radio Listening Synchronization Using Rendezvous Chain Based}} on {{TSCH}}},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Bae, Byeong-Hwan and Chung, Sang-Hwa and Lee, Hee-Jun},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/52Y4QUN7/Bae et al. - Distributed Radio Listening Synchronization Using .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985034598,"version":0,"updated":1563985950290},"$loki":2953},{"itemID":5793,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{reali_orchestration_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Orchestration of {{Cloud Genomic Services}}},\n  abstract = {The amount of resources necessary for genome processing services in clouds is huge.

The massive deployment of such devices may overwhelm the cellular network by imposing strong constraints on the Radio Access Network (RAN) because of the radio resources' scarcity. As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would efficiently help to overcome the risk of congestion. In this paper, we proposed a novel fluid model for M2M communications, which allows gaining an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of such systems. The provided analysis of the model was used to devise a new method to estimate accurately the number of M2M devices willing to connect as well as the number of random access attempts.We proposed, then, a novel implementation of the ACB process, which dynamically computes the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions while includes a corrective action adapting the controller action based on the mismatch existing between the computed and the targeted mean load. Compared to existing approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms allow improving considerably the estimation of the number of M2M devices' arrivals, while outperforming existing techniques in terms of the number of abandons, the success and the collision probabilities, and the average access delay.},\n  eventtitle = {The 19th {{ACM International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 19th {{ACM International Conference}} on {{Modeling}}, {{Analysis}} and {{Simulation}} of {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Systems}} - {{MSWiM}} '16},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {287-291},\n  author = {Bouzouita, Meriam and Hadjadj-Aoul, Yassine and Zangar Tunisia, Nawel and Rubino, Gerardo and Tabbane, Sami},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W7VBDTD4/Bouzouita et al_2016_Dynamic Adaptive Access Barring Scheme For Heavily Congested M2M Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985035544,"version":0,"updated":1563985949270},"$loki":2955},{"itemID":4067,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_evaluation_,\n  title = {\\'Evaluation et Am\\'elioration Des Plates-Formes Logicielles Pour R\\'eseaux de Capteurs sans-Fil, Pour Optimiser La Qualit\\'e de Service et l'\\'energie},\n  url = {http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2016_0051_ROUSSEL.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-04-17},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/N8LVHV5W/DDOC_T_2016_0051_ROUSSEL.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985035570,"version":0,"updated":1563985949484},"$loki":2956},{"itemID":4754,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_interoperability_b,\n  title = {Interoperability on the {{Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/Z4QVJDT4/pilgrimbeart1248-ifm7nov2013-131107105002-phpapp01.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985035584,"version":0,"updated":1563985949878},"$loki":2957},{"itemID":5819,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_low_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Low {{Complexity Beam Searching Algorithm Using Asymptotic Property}} of {{Massive MIMO Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436659/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436659},\n  abstract = {This paper considers a low complexity codebookbased beam searching algorithm for massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems in limited scattering environments.

It represents a key component of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart spaces. One of the most difficult challenges to support M2M communications is their huge number compared to available radio resources. Hence, to deal with random access channel (RACH) overload and to better control the access in LTE-A Networks, the 3GPP proposed the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor concept. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve this method based on adaptive multiple ACB factors, according to M2M traffic category with respect to their access delay budget and drop rate (QoS parameters). Simulations were done for testing the effectiveness of our MACB scheme and show that using multiples ACB factors and dynamically adjusting them to the congestion level in addition to traffic type category increases the access probability and reduces overload. The obtained results were then compared to the basic ACB method and show that the access probability increases especially for high priority traffic.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016-01},\n  pages = {693-698},\n  author = {Zangar, Nawel and Gharbi, Sami and Abdennebi, Marwen},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/QPWEPI5R/Zangar et al_2016_Service differentiation strategy based on MACB factor for M2M Communications in.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985036644,"version":0,"updated":1563985949278},"$loki":2967},{"itemID":4405,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{jiang_joint_2018,\n  title = {A {{Joint Multi}}-{{Criteria Utility}}-{{Based Network Selection Approach}} for {{Vehicle}}-to-{{Infrastructure Networking}}},\n  volume = {19},\n  issn = {1524-9050, 1558-0016},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8248667/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TITS.2017.2778939},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

The IoT gateways play an important role in the IoT applications to bridge between sensor networks and the external environment through the Internet. Typically, the IoT gateways collect and send the data collected from sensors and actuators to external platforms where they will be remotely analyzed. However, the users desire a more adapted IoT gateway that can improve the IoT data privacy preservation before sending them to these external platforms. Thus, an IoT gateway that enables a better control over the set of private IoT resources and protects the collected personal data and their privacy is required. For this purpose, we propose a Semantic IoT Gateway that helps implement a dynamic and flexible privacy-preserving solution for the IoT domain. First, it enables to match between the data consumer's terms of service and the data owner's privacy preferences by generating an adapted privacy policy. Second, it converts the privacy policy into a custom smart contract. Finally, it connects a set of private IoT resources to a distributed network using the blockchain technology to host the generated smart contracts. A smart contract is an executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. Our proposal, which is highlighted through an example and experimentation on a real-world use-case, has given the expected results.},\n  booktitle = {On the {{Move}} to {{Meaningful Internet Systems}}. {{OTM}} 2018 {{Conferences}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {207-225},\n  author = {Loukil, Faiza and Ghedira-Guegan, Chirine and Boukadi, Khouloud and Benharkat, A\\\"icha Nabila},\n  editor = {Panetto, Herv\\'e and Debruyne, Christophe and Proper, Henderik A. and Ardagna, Claudio Agostino and Roman, Dumitru and Meersman, Robert},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W3ZCMLKK/Loukil et al. - 2018 - Semantic IoT Gateway Towards Automated Generation.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985036722,"version":0,"updated":1563985949758},"$loki":2969},{"itemID":5761,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{virdaus_performance_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Performance {{Analysis}} of {{Hybrid}}-{{Based Packet Forwarding}} in {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436677/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436677},\n  abstract = {In Wireless Sensor Networks, preserving energy is very important to prolong the sensor node's life. Duty cycle mechanism could preserve the node's energy by providing active and sleep period. However, the uncontrolled duty cycle may affect the delivery rate due to its inconsistency of relay participation in multi-hop packet forwarding. We have observed the effect of duty cycle mechanism to deliver data with a broadcast flooding; which we know that flooding is a fundamental network service for disseminating data. From our observation, controlling a contention window size based on node's density takes an important part in reducing packet collision that leads to a good packet delivery rate. However, in a congested traffic, controlling contention window size based on node's density is not enough because the incoming packet may be congested in packet buffer which is resulting to a packet dropping. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid-based packet forwarding to increase the reliability of transmission by controlling the number of contention window size based on the node's density and packet buffer information. To preserve the energy of the nodes, we also implemented the probability-based broadcast to suppress the number of unnecessary traffic. We compared our work with broadcast flooding, adaptive contention window size, and distance-based broadcast. From our experiment, Hybridbased packet forwarding achieved the best performance in packet reception rate and can control the unnecessary traffic better than others.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {432-435},\n  author = {Virdaus, Irvanda Kurniadi and Kang, Moonsoo and Lee, Chung Ghiu},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/HTMKBXA2/Virdaus et al. - 2018 - Performance Analysis of Hybrid-Based Packet Forwar.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985036762,"version":0,"updated":1563985950614},"$loki":2970},{"itemID":3715,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{bouzouita_adaptive_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Messina, Italy}},\n  title = {Adaptive Access Protocol for Heavily Congested {{M2M}} Networks},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-0679-3},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7543886/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ISCC.2016.7543886},\n  abstract = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications are expected to be one of the major drivers of future cellular networks, due to a plethora of services provided to operators and consumers. This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion. One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances. Thus, we proposed, in this paper, a new method to estimate accurately the number of random access attempts in a way to measure efficiently the congestion level. Then, we proposed a novel implementation of the ACB process that mainly consists of dynamically adapting the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions by improving significantly the access's success probability while minimizing radio resources' underutilization.

In addition, by defining the I/O required for each interlocking function module and designing the interface between modules, the interlocking function module studies the reliable network simulator interlocking function, including the functions given in the standard.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Lee, Sung-Hun and Park, Tae-Uk and Cho, Soo-Hyun and Cho, Hyun-Kyu and Cho, Kyu-Chul},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/2FGQIZLD/Lee et al. - A Study on Simplified Test Bench Evaluation Model .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985037784,"version":0,"updated":1563985950840},"$loki":2982},{"itemID":4295,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{lim_spreading_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Spreading {{Factor Allocation}} for {{Massive Connectivity}} in {{LoRa Systems}}},\n  volume = {22},\n  issn = {1089-7798},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8268120/},\n  doi = {10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2797274},\n  abstract = {Along with enhanced mobile broadband and ultrareliable low latency communication, massive connectivity has been one of the key requirements for enabling technologies of 5G. For IoT, low power consumption and wide area coverage for end devices (ED) are important figures of merit, for which LoRa, SigFox and Narrow Band-IoT are dominant technologies. In this letter, we analyze LoRa systems for increasing average system packet success probability (PSP) under unslotted ALOHA random access protocol. The lower bound for average system PSP is derived when many contending EDs are transmitting by stochastic geometry. And it is shown that the average system PSP can be maximized by properly allocating an SF to each traffic, which also maximizes connectivity of EDs. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the average system PSP to propose a sub-optimal SF allocation scheme to each traffic. Analysis on PSP is validated through simulations, and comparison with existing schemes reveals that our proposed scheme achieves the highest PSP and so the maximum connectivity.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Letters},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

Our WRx features very low power consumption ({$<$} 1.3{$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}W), high sensitivity (up to -55dBm), fast reactivity (wake-up time of 130{$\\mathrm{\\mu}$}s), and selective addressing, a key enabler of new high performance protocols. We then present ALBAWUR, a cross-layer solution for data gathering in sensing systems that redesigns a previous leading protocol, ALBA-R, extending it to exploit the features of our WRx. We evaluate the performance of ALBA-WUR via simulations, showing that the use of the WRx produces remarkable energy savings (up to five orders of magnitude), and achieves lifetimes that are decades longer than those obtained by ALBA-R in sensing systems with duty cycling, while keeping latencies at bay.},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE INFOCOM}} 2015 - {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications}}},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE Conference}} on {{Computer Communications}} ({{INFOCOM}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2015-04},\n  pages = {522-530},\n  author = {Spenza, Dora and Magno, Michele and Basagni, Stefano and Benini, Luca and Paoli, Mario and Petrioli, Chiara},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6CM74A8X/Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/JLXYXZMT/Spenza et al. - 2015 - Beyond duty cycling Wake-up radio with selective .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985038072,"version":0,"updated":1563985949968},"$loki":2984},{"itemID":5830,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kim_study_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Study}} on {{D2D Caching Systems}} with {{Mobile Helpers}}},\n  abstract = {Due to the increase of video-on-demand and streaming services, the amount of data traffic in both wired and wireless networks is increasing exponentially.

The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Fitwi, Alem and University, Binghamton and Chen, Yu and University, Binghamton and Zhu, Sencun and University, Penn State},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ZHEDHGMK/Fitwi et al. - A Lightweight Blockchain-Based Privacy Protection .pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985038120,"version":0,"updated":1563985951052},"$loki":2986},{"itemID":3461,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{farooq_operating_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Operating {{Systems}} for {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  volume = {11},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/11/6/5900},\n  doi = {10.3390/s110605900},\n  shorttitle = {Operating {{Systems}} for {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2011-05-31},\n  pages = {5900-5930},\n  author = {Farooq, Muhammad Omer and Kunz, Thomas},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6E6T6QJ5/Farooq_Kunz_2011_Operating Systems for Wireless Sensor Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00219}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985038340,"version":0,"updated":1563985949182},"$loki":2987},{"itemID":4564,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@book{cesa-bianchi_prediction_2006,\n  langid = {french},\n  location = {{Cambridge ; New York}},\n  title = {Prediction, learning, and games},\n  isbn = {978-0-521-84108-5},\n  pagetotal = {394},\n  publisher = {{Cambridge University Press}},\n  date = {2006},\n  keywords = {ML,Game},\n  author = {Cesa-Bianchi, Nicol\\`o and Lugosi, G\\'abor},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/8JU7HZE7/Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi - 2006 - Prediction, learning, and games.pdf},\n  note = {02716}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985038388,"version":0,"updated":1563985949760},"$loki":2989},{"itemID":5023,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{hoeller_exploiting_2018,\n  title = {Exploiting {{Time Diversity}} of {{LoRa Networks Through Optimum Message Replication}}},\n  booktitle = {2018 15th {{International Symposium}} on {{Wireless Communication Systems}} ({{ISWCS}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {1--5},\n  author = {Hoeller, Arliones and Souza, Richard Demo and L\\`opez, Onel L.

To satisfy rapidly evolving and newly emerging services, PON devices have to be evolved in order to make them adaptable to the always changing requirements while facilitating energy-saving operations. In this paper, we propose an adaptive software-defined (SD) ONU energy-saving mechanism. We propose to enhance the standard PON devices with advanced SDN capabilities so that an SD-controller can practice its global network knowledge to orchestrate an independent energy-saving mechanism for ONU's receiver (Rx) and transmitter (Tx) via the assignment of Rx sleeping duration and Tx wake-up threshold, respectively. In low traffic condition, the proposed mechanism can reduce the ONU's transmitter active time up to 98\\% while still guaranteeing the QoS requirements.

In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a ``data marketplace'' by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial transaction and providing ``by design'' remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end.

This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the offered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of e ciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for different multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of different parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study. In the first part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user's preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario.

In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users' complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufficient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great influences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper first defines the SFSD and describes the important influences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  urldate = {2019-04-27},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {39895-39906},\n  author = {Min, Xunyou and Xu, Xiaofei and Liu, Zhizhong and Chu, Dianhui and Wang, Zhongjie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/I8KMID9I/Min et al. - 2018 - An Approach to Resource and QoS-Aware Services Opt.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985041082,"version":0,"updated":1563985949410},"$loki":3016},{"itemID":4765,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{wannachai_adaptive_2015,\n  location = {{Singapore}},\n  title = {Adaptive {{Transmission Range Based}} on {{Event Detection}} for {{WSNs}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-8055-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7106944/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ISSNIP.2015.7106944},\n  eventtitle = {2015 {{IEEE Tenth International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Sensors}}, {{Sensor Networks}} and {{Information Processing}} ({{ISSNIP}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE Tenth International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Sensors}}, {{Sensor Networks}} and {{Information Processing}} ({{ISSNIP}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-02},\n  date = {2015-04},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  keywords = {Range},\n  author = {Wannachai, Autanan and Champrasert, Paskorn},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/59QLME7G/Wannachai_Champrasert_2015_Adaptive Transmission Range Based on Event Detection for WSNs.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985041112,"version":0,"updated":1563985949896},"$loki":3017},{"itemID":5606,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{katsumata_i2v_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{I2V Multi}}-{{Hop Broadcast Communication}} by {{TC}}-{{BF Method}}},\n  abstract = {A novel Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) multi-hop broadcast communication technique is proposed.

Providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in such frameworks is highly challenging because of the dynamic and loosely coupled nature of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). A framework called the SPontaneous Information and Resource sharing InfrasTructure (SPIRIT) has been presented before to address the challenges of proximity-aware mobile sensor sharing. SPIRIT allows mobile applications to share sensors as services in an automatic fashion by enabling the service providers and clients to express a variety of QoS specifications. This paper presents a set of mobility-aware QoS mechanisms for enabling the implementation of QoS specifications along the multihop paths between service providers and clients in highly mobile environments. Simulations in small-scale Mobile Ad Hoc Networks show SPIRIT's ability to effectively control and manage traffic flows while maintaining desired QoS.

Existing schemes for iBGP routing include the full-mesh (FM) solution, route reflection (RR) solution and confederation. Optimal prefix routing and route diversity are the main strength of the FM solution. However, it is rarely employed in a large networks due to its poor scalability. The RR scheme solves the scalability challenge at the cost of FM optimality due to Route Reflector's partial view of the network. The concept of Software Defined Networking (SDN) entails decoupling of the control plane from the forwarding plane such that the control plane is logically centralized benefiting from an overall knowledge of the network for decision making. In this work, we propose a solution based on multicasting which employs relay nodes in the iBGP message dissemination. The relay nodes are elected and act as boundaries of multicast groups, relaying and filtering prefixes into other multicast groups. We evaluate the use of single and multiple relay nodes per multicast group. Our solution brings session management scalability and minimization of duplicate prefix announcement through elimination of peer sessions deemed unnecessary.

Every smart device in IoT consists of a power source sensors, microprocessor and transceiver module to sense, communicate and exchange data among each other. In distributed IoT networks, the energy efficiency of the smart objects is a key factor in the overall network performance. Most of the times IoT's have to deal with low power and communication disconnection due to the limited memory, processing capability, and power. Few techniques for stringent Quality of Service (QoS) routing in IoT have been proposed despite its great impact on future network. In this paper, we propose energyefficient possibilistic routing based on fuzzy logic model for IoT to controls the transmission of the routing request packets to increase the network lifetime and decrease the packet loss. The proposed fuzzy logic controller accepts the input descriptors in routing metrics to optimize the network performance. The proposed algorithm adopts energy-efficient possibilistic routing by using fuzzy inference rules to merge energy aware metrics for choosing the optimal delivery path. In the simulations, we verify that the proposed algorithm has longer IoT network lifetime and consumes the residual energy of each smart node more consistently when compared with the existing traditional protocols.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {320-325},\n  author = {Shah, Babar},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/KVXT2Q74/Shah - 2018 - Fuzzy Energy Efficient Routing for Internet of Thi.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985042060,"version":0,"updated":1563985950562},"$loki":3030},{"itemID":2963,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{xu_jamming_2006,\n  title = {Jamming Sensor Networks: Attack and Defense Strategies},\n  volume = {20},\n  issn = {0890-8044},\n  doi = {10.1109/MNET.2006.1637931},\n  shorttitle = {Jamming Sensor Networks},\n  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are built upon a shared medium that makes it easy for adversaries to conduct radio interference, or jamming, attacks that effectively cause a denial of service of either transmission or reception functionalities.

In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Network},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Netw.},\n  date = {2006-05},\n  pages = {41-47},\n  keywords = {SIR},\n  author = {Xu, Wenyuan and Ma, Ke and Trappe, W. and Zhang, Yanyong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SYTFJXL4/Xu et al_2006_Jamming sensor networks.pdf},\n  note = {00565}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":10,"created":1563985042352,"version":0,"updated":1563985949066},"$loki":3031},{"itemID":3284,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{perera_context_21,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Context {{Aware Computing}} for {{The Internet}} of {{Things}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  volume = {16},\n  issn = {1553-877X},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0982},\n  doi = {10.1109/SURV.2013.042313.00197},\n  shorttitle = {Context {{Aware Computing}} for {{The Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  abstract = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace.

In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches.

The concept of a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) sensor network was introduced, built up by lightweight Ultra Low Power (ULP) nodes attached to the back of the animals, transmitting sensor data via long range telemetry over a distance of several kilometers. The network architecture was discussed and suitable transmission schemes meeting the harsh energy and weight restrictions were evaluated. For an optimal system performance, however, it is also essential that the receiving network is properly designed. In this paper, we elaborate the development of a LPWA reception network of telemetry-related base stations, tackling the highly demanding requirements for mobility, energy efficiency and remote maintainability. Both, hardware as well as software components are addressed and their interactions are illustrated. The energetically self-sustaining base stations are equipped with directional and omni-directional antennas in a MIMO-like fashion.

It is an autonomous network where peers may submit models with improved accuracy and other peers may verify the accuracy improvement. The system maintains an append-only decentralized ledger to keep the log of critical information, including who has trained the model and improved its accuracy, when it has been improved, by how much it has improved, and where to find the newly updated model. DaiMoN rewards these contributing peers with cryptographic tokens. A main feature of DaiMoN is that it allows peers to verify the accuracy improvement of submitted models without knowing the test labels. This is an essential component in order to mitigate intentional model overfitting by model-improving peers. To enable this model accuracy evaluation with hidden test labels, DaiMoN uses a novel learnable Distance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function proposed in this paper. Specific to each test dataset, DEL scrambles the test label vector by embedding it in a low-dimension space while approximately preserving the distance between the dataset's test label vector and a label vector inferred by the classifier. It therefore allows proof-of-improvement (PoI) by peers without providing them access to true test labels. We provide analysis and empirical evidence that under DEL, peers can accurately assess model accuracy. We also argue that it is hard to invert the embedding function and thus, DEL is resilient against attacks aiming to recover test labels in order to cheat.

The technology, however, less considers both of the cache placement in time for handover (HO) of mobile terminals and the increase in the traffic between MEC servers for cache distribution. The increase in the traffic is caused by duplicated routes of cache transfer from a location of content data to cache locations and by cache placements on more MEC servers to improve cache hit rate according to a mobile terminal transition. In this paper, we propose a novel proactive cache system which transfers cache data in time for HO of mobile terminals and reduces the traffic between MEC servers, using a route de-duplicating technique for cache transfer and selective data delivery utilizing the locations of mobile terminals predicted from cellular-radio information. We also propose the system architecture which enables services to utilize cellular-radio information by APIs, and evaluate the system by a simulation of the HO prediction and the estimation of the traffic between MEC servers for transferring caches.

Since radar technology is continuously evolving and diversifying, however, the library based method can not properly classify the signals for new threats which are not in the existing libraries, thus limiting the choice of appropriate jamming techniques. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the signals so that the optimal jamming technique can be selected by using only the parameter data of the radar signal.

Standard MAC protocols developed for duty-cycled WSNs such as BMAC, which is the default MAC protocol for TinyOS, employ an extended preamble and preamble sampling. While this ``low power listening'' approach is simple, asynchronous, and energy-efficient, the long preamble introduces excess latency at each hop, is suboptimal in terms of energy consumption, and suffers from excess energy consumption at nontarget receivers. X-MAC proposes solutions to each of these problems by employing a shortened preamble approach that retains the advantages of low power listening, namely low power communication, simplicity and a decoupling of transmitter and receiver sleep schedules. We demonstrate through implementation and evaluation in a wireless sensor testbed that X-MAC's shortened preamble approach significantly reduces energy usage at both the transmitter and receiver, reduces per-hop latency, and offers additional advantages such as flexible adaptation to both bursty and periodic sensor data sources.},\n  pages = {14},\n  author = {Buettner, Michael and Yee, Gary V and Anderson, Eric and Han, Richard},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/8AZQMW8U/Buettner et al. - X-MAC A Short PreambSleenMsAoCr NPertowtoocrkosl .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":11,"created":1563985046542,"version":0,"updated":1563985950024},"$loki":3073},{"itemID":5895,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{song_freeviewpoint_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Free-{{Viewpoint Relationship Description Based Streaming Systems}} for {{Arbitrary View Switching}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436845/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436845},\n  abstract = {Recent advances in video processing and transmitting technologies have increased user interest and demand for realistic services.

OpenHIE provides a framework for implementing an HIE which is based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Its design has been proven to work, and other countries and organizations have shown interest in adopting its components. Currently, OpenHIE can provide the de facto standard for securing health information systems. However, several essential security features concerning the privacy of health information have yet to be implemented. Here we explore the application of Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) on OpenHIE to realize the aforementioned security features.

Due to the benefits of energy harvesting (EH) technologies, wireless devices are able to support the dataintensive wireless multimedia services by harvesting energy from the environment. Energy harvesting has emerged as the promising technology to solve the energy supply problem while bringing new challenges due to the stochastic nature of the harvested energy in supporting the heterogeneous statistical quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. However, due to the unknown dynamics of the harvested energy as well as the channel state information (CSI), it is challenging to design the efficient routing protocol for selecting the optimal routing and power allocation policies under the statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints. To overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose the Q-learning based optimal routing and power allocation policies through learning from the history of the energy harvesting process while satisfying the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over multihop big-data relay networks. In particular, under the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS requirements, we formulate the endto-end effective-capacity optimization problem for the batteryfree energy harvesting based big-data multihop relay networks. Then, we apply the Markov decision process and Q-learning methods for deriving the optimal multihop routing algorithms over big-data multihop relay networks. Also conducted is a set of simulations which evaluate the system performances and show that our proposed Q-learning based multihop routing scheme outperforms the other existing schemes under the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over multihop big-data relay networks.},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Zhang, Xi and Wang, Jingqing and Zhu, Qixuan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/W74AYANG/Zhang et al. - Q-Learning Based Energy Harvesting for Heterogeneo.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":11,"created":1563985047272,"version":0,"updated":1563985951082},"$loki":3082},{"itemID":3836,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bloessl_performance_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Performance {{Assessment}} of {{IEEE}} 802.11p with an {{Open Source SDR}}-{{Based Prototype}}},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {1536-1233},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8031977/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TMC.2017.2751474},\n  abstract = {We present a complete simulation and experimentation framework for IEEE 802.11p.

In this work, we present an enhanced LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN MAC protocol is characterized by the restrictive use of the channel, limited by the regulatory authorities to a 1\\% duty cycle per cycle (i.e., 36 s per hour) per node. This regulation penalizes the nodes which require a channel access time greater than the limited duty cycle to occasionally transmit a large amount of data such as video surveillance or access control information in applications like smart school surveillance. However, some other nodes like environment sensors sharing a same LoRaWAN server may send very small amounts of information (e.g. temperature, humidity, ...) and under-use the authorized activity time of 1\\% duty cycle. Hence the idea of implementing an activity time sharing mechanism among nodes that allows devices to borrow additional activity time from a device or set of devices that have completed the transmission of their packets and do not need the remaining time of the corresponding duty cycle. Our work extends and improves the activity time sharing mechanism initially proposed in [1]. Instead of FIFO sharing-time allocation based on a global activity time, which may lead to the starvation of the nodes that are others than that in the head of FIFO line, we propose a new time allocation algorithm based on the classification of the different requests according to their needs in terms of their QoS requirements. It allows to satisfy a larger number of nodes requiring extra time, with less control overheads while ensuring fairness. Our time-sharing algorithm has been implemented and tested on the wasp-mote chip of libelium, showing the performance improvement and its practical usability.},\n  booktitle = {Ad-Hoc, {{Mobile}}, and {{Wireless Networks}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {147-162},\n  author = {Benkahla, Norhane and Tounsi, Hajer and Song, Ye-Qiong and Frikha, Mounir},\n  editor = {Montavont, Nicolas and Papadopoulos, Georgios Z.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/YN2LAJUR/Benkahla et al. - 2018 - Enhanced Dynamic Duty Cycle in LoRaWAN Network.pdf},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-00247-3_15},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":11,"created":1563985048670,"version":0,"updated":1563985951026},"$loki":3086},{"itemID":4377,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{berard_analysing_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Analysing Timed Compatibility of Web Service Choreography},\n  volume = {7},\n  issn = {1757-8779, 1757-8787},\n  url = {http://www.inderscience.com/link.php?id=10009398},\n  doi = {10.1504/IJCCBS.2017.10009398},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Critical Computer-Based Systems},\n  shortjournal = IJCCBS,\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {253},\n  author = {B\\'erard, B\\'eatrice and Boufaida, Mahmoud and Benabdelhafid, Maya Souilah},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":11,"created":1563985049124,"version":0,"updated":1563985949594},"$loki":3087},{"itemID":4457,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_lowpower_,\n  title = {Low-Power, {{Long}}-Range {{WAN}} for {{IoT}}: A Technology Overview},\n  url = {http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/Paper/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/3BE7JT5S/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":11,"created":1563985049144,"version":0,"updated":1563985949666},"$loki":3088},{"itemID":5872,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{ningombam_decentralized_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Decentralized {{Resource Allocation}} for {{Multicast D2D Communications Using Stochastic Geometry}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss on the device-to-device (D2D) communication to fulfill the exponentially growing demands of the high data rate services.

One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a network selection scheme, which is for users that select an optimal network with best comprehensive performance between different types of networks. However, the optimal network may be not the most reasonable one due to compensation of MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making), and the network is called pseudo-optimal network. This paper conducts a performance evaluation of a number of widely used MADM-based methods for network selection that aim to keep the mobile users always best connected anywhere and anytime, where subjective weight and objective weight are all considered. The performance analysis shows that the selection scheme based on MEW (weighted multiplicative method) and combination weight can better avoid accessing pseudo-optimal network for balancing network load and reducing ping-pong effect in comparison with three other MADM solutions.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  author = {Zhou, Jian and Zhu, Can-yan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/INK55447/Zhou_Zhu_2016_Compensatory Analysis and Optimization for MADM for Heterogeneous Wireless.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":11,"created":1563985049710,"version":0,"updated":1563985949630},"$loki":3092},{"itemID":5625,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{choi_impact_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Impact of {{Imperfect Spectrum Sensing}} on {{Hybrid Backscatter Assisted Cognitive Wireless Powered Radio Networks}}},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a proper sensing period when the detection probability of determining the state of the primary user (PU) changes in a hybrid harvest-then-transmit (HTT) system according to the sensing period.

Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a singlekeyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved. Finally, we implement the protocol in a local simulated blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that our multi-keyword search protocol outperforms the traditional method with an average of 14.67\\% less time delay and 59.96\\% less financial cost.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Jiang, Shan and University, Hong Kong Polytechnic and Cao, Jiannong and University, Hong Hong Polytechnic and Mccann, Julie A and London, Imperial College and Yang, Yanni and University, Hong Kong Polytechnic and Liu, Yang and Limited, Alibaba Group Holding and Wang, Xiaoqing and Limited, Alibaba Group Holding and Deng, Yuming and Limited, Alibaba Group Holding},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/F7N38L7G/Jiang et al. - Privacy-Preserving and Efficient Multi-Keyword Sea.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":11,"created":1563985050264,"version":0,"updated":1563985951042},"$loki":3098},{"itemID":3992,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_1libelium_,\n  title = {1-{{LIBELIUM}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/UCRJZKHD/waspmote_lora_868mhz_915mhz_sx1272_networking_guide.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":9,"created":1563985050662,"version":0,"updated":1563985949412},"$loki":3099},{"itemID":4445,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_1semtech_,\n  title = {1-{{SEMTECH}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/E5FUSDPG/SEMTECH.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":9,"created":1563985050674,"version":0,"updated":1563985949656},"$loki":3100},{"itemID":4446,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_1alliance_2015,\n  title = {1-{{ALLIANCE}}},\n  date = {2015},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/99EFHYWK/2015 - ALLIANCE.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":9,"created":1563985050686,"version":0,"updated":1563985949658},"$loki":3101},{"itemID":4753,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_1lora_,\n  title = {1-{{Lora}}: {{Detection Theory}}},\n  keywords = {PL},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/IREH59NG/myDetectionTheoryNotes.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":9,"created":1563985050696,"version":0,"updated":1563985949876},"$loki":3102},{"itemID":4057,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pham_lowcost_g,\n  title = {Low-Cost {{LoRa IoT}} Device: A Step-by-Step Tutorial},\n  author = {{Pham}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/DSDKZMDR/RESSACS16-Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985050828,"version":0,"updated":1563985949464},"$loki":3103},{"itemID":5612,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{layek_centeremphasized_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Center-{{Emphasized Gradient}}-{{Feature Based Quality Assessment Method}} for {{Screen Content Images}}},\n  abstract = {Screen content images (SCI) are composed of texts, graphics, images, emails, web pages, and other computergenerated components which make it different from the pure natural images. As a result, image quality assessment (IQA) methods designed for natural images are not always suitable for screen content images. However, as time goes, many screen contents are being generated which share several properties of natural images. As a result, IQA methods for SCI need to be more generic while giving priority to the prominent SCI features. The image gradient is a very important feature for all kinds of images, especially for SCI. In this paper, we proposed a novel image gradient based similarity index (CGSI) for screen content images where the gradient is used both as a quality map and extractor for another feature map. Our previous studies show that the center part of an image is visually the most important part and HVS is more sensitive to any distortion in the middle area. To address this issue, the center area of both gradient and feature similarity maps are raised by element-wise squaring. Eventually, the final quality score is calculated using a summation of standard deviation based pooling strategy. We evaluated our proposed method on three large scale SCI databases and compared with 8 other state-of-the-art IQA methods designed for both natural and screen content images. Results show that the proposed approach provides competitive performance and defeats all other methods with a large gap in overall performance. Also, the relatively faster running time makes it suitable for most of the real-time applications.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Layek, Abu and Thu, Ngo Thien and Yu, SoYeon and Chung, TaeChoong and Huh, Eui-Nam},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/R5BFPAQT/Layek et al. - Center-Emphasized Gradient-Feature Based Quality A.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985050882,"version":0,"updated":1563985950278},"$loki":3104},{"itemID":5888,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{elsayed_detection_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Detection and {{Countermeasures}} of {{DDoS Attacks}} in {{Cloud Computing}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436989/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436989},\n  abstract = {Greater portions of the world are moving to cloud computing because of its advantages However, due to its distributed nature, it can be easily exploited by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

The proposed algorithm aims at adapting the period that the system interferes with others and reducing the packet loss rate of uplink communication of the whole system to below the required value by adapting DC with the help of measurement-based spectrum database (MSD). In the proposed method, MSD knows the number of LoRa nodes that interfere with the nodes of other systems. The DC is calculated for keeping the period of interference to less than a certain duration. In addition, the DC is also adapted based on the required packet loss rate to improve communication efficiency.

According to an IBS report, the cost of developing a System on Chip (SoC) at 14nm may be as high as \\$300 million [1]. The economics of semiconductor IC development favors high volume production, while high volume cannot be attained without developing an IC that serves a large number of applications. Some of these applications are in lowmargin Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where an SoC cannot command a high price. Consequently, without the ability to customize IC features after production, the price of an IC will be determined by its lowest priced application. This motivates the manufacturers to develop capabilities for post-production IC customization. The commodity microprocessor business offers an example of post-production customization, where a manufacturer can tailor cache size, number of cores and frequency of operation for a target market segment after a chip has been manufactured. Today, such customization is limited to one-time programming (OTP) for predetermined IC bins. In this paper, we explore how an IC can be programmed repeatedly and securely using a blockchain-based smart contract. This will enable users to upgrade IC features, or rent upgraded IC features for a fixed period after it has been purchased. The availability of such a system could, for example, allow a buyer to upgrade her processor from i3 to i5 after it has been purchased to scale to her computing needs in exchange of a payment made to the manufacturer. IC feature configuration is implemented by firmware updates from the manufacturer. The smart contract takes the feature configuration request from the IC as input and outputs the source of corresponding firmware. To support remote and authorized update by manufacturer, we propose an on-die hardware module that communicates with the smart contract and enforces its functionalities. Availability of this module also facilitates secure firmware update. The blockchain makes the update protocol secure and prevents users from obtaining unauthorized update.

Even the simplest objects will become ``smart'' because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  urldate = {2019-02-14},\n  date = {2017-03-01},\n  pages = {74-84},\n  author = {Aloi, G. and Caliciuri, G. and Fortino, G. and Gravina, R. and Pace, P. and Russo, W. and Savaglio, C.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/L6P8YIFR/Aloi et al_2017_Enabling IoT interoperability through opportunistic smartphone-based mobile.pdf},\n  note = {00106}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985052022,"version":0,"updated":1563985949216},"$loki":3111},{"itemID":4974,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{grosswindhager_enabling_2018,\n  title = {Enabling Runtime Adaptation of Physical Layer Settings for Dependable Uwb Communications},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE}} 19th {{International Symposium}} on\" {{A World}} of {{Wireless}}, {{Mobile}} and {{Multimedia Networks}}\"({{WoWMoM}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {01--11},\n  author = {Gro\\textbackslash{}s swindhager, Bernhard and Boano, Carlo Alberto and Rath, Michael and R\\\"omer, Kay},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WY462BZI/Gros swindhager et al_2018_Enabling runtime adaptation of physical layer settings for dependable uwb.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985052050,"version":0,"updated":1563985950046},"$loki":3112},{"itemID":5661,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_devkopter_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {{{DevKopter}}, {{Multicopter Development Platform}} for {{Engineers}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437029/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437029},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the development of a standard flight platform for verification of small UAV research and development.

As a multi-hop wireless network, U-Bus Air gathers meter reading information connected to a monitoring center. The terminal with the function of connecting to a monitoring center is called a gateway (GW). The multi-hop function is used to connect GWs; this reduces the cost of connecting wide-area wireless networks. However, the order of installing a new terminal is random because it is determined by timing of replacement on meter in individual homes on meters in individual homes. As a result, the installing location of GWs cannot be specified in advance. Consequently, any created network topology will exhibit redundancies, such as unnecessary GWs, or generate many small networks. In this paper, we propose two different redundancy reducing methods that use information of terminals on cloud to reconstruct a network topology. The proposed methods consists of three steps: gathering information, emulating the topology to reduce redundancy using cloud, and providing feedback to rebuild information of each smart meter. We perform a computer simulation to evaluate the packet delivery ratio (PDR) and the reduction ratio of the number of GWs. We confirm that the redundancy can be reduced by using the proposed methods without affecting the performance of the network topology.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {223-228},\n  author = {Sanada, Hiroshi and Fujii, Takeo and Aizawa, Reina and Kawata, Takuya},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/P8Y5RV88/Sanada et al. - 2018 - Routing Redundancy Reducing Method for U-Bus Air U.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985053188,"version":0,"updated":1563985950520},"$loki":3122},{"itemID":4755,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_live_,\n  title = {Live {{Objects}}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MXBJMHZZ/Presentation Live-Objects.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985053740,"version":0,"updated":1563985949880},"$loki":3123},{"itemID":5556,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{atoev_secure_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {The {{Secure UAV Communication Link Based}} on {{OTP Encryption Technique}}},\n  abstract = {The demand on the security and reliability of the communication and data link of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is much higher since the environment of the modern battlefield is becoming more and more complex.

Even when the gates used to perform these operations are noisy, the quantum computation must be tolerable to the errors.

In this paper, we propose a Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming model (MOMILP) aiming at simultaneously minimizing the VM rejection ratio, the resource wastage and the number of used PMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which combines such objectives in a Multi-Objective model. We also assume heterogeneous configuration for the data center which has been proven, through recent research work and industrial experience, to be more costeffective for some applications especially those with intensive Input/Output (I/O) operations. To assess the performance of the proposed model, a comparative study has been curried out. Through the simulation results, it was observed that the proposed model achieves total gains reaching 35\\% and 10\\% in terms of resource wastage and power consumption respectively. It was also reported that the power consumption is not only impacted by the number of used PMs but also by the selected PM configurations.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {401-406},\n  author = {Regaieg, Rym and Koubaa, Mohamed and Osei-Opoku, Evans and Aguili, Taoufik},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6WIMGPST/Regaieg et al. - 2018 - Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming M.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985054480,"version":0,"updated":1563985950600},"$loki":3130},{"itemID":3652,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{masoudi_software_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Software Defined Networks: {{A}} Survey},\n  volume = {67},\n  issn = {10848045},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084804516300297},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jnca.2016.03.016},\n  shorttitle = {Software Defined Networks},\n  abstract = {As a result of the development of internet and ICT (information-centric technology) advances including mobile, cloud, social networking, big data, multimedia and the tendency towards digital society, the management and configuration of them have become highly complex, challenging and time consuming.

Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities. Although SDN is regarded as a new research issue, it has attracted numerous researchers' attention from both industrial and academic institutes. In this paper, data plane, control plane and application plane as the three planes of SDN and the interfaces between them such as OpenFlow are investigated and the challenges and the latest technologies in relation to SDN are examined.

In this paper, we model a LoRa network consisting of nodes with different communication settings in terms of bandwidth and spreading factor. We compute the average success probability per configuration as a function of density taking into account both intra and inter-spreading factor collisions. We, also, formulate and solve an optimization problem to maximize the node capacity for a given deployment area and frequency by optimizing the number of nodes having different spreading factor configurations. We present numerical results and we show that solutions close to the optimal can increase the maximum number of nodes by more than 700\\% compared to case where equal number of users per spreading factor are considered.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 25th {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-20},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {516-520},\n  author = {Zorbas, Dimitrios and Papadopoulos, Georgios Z. and Maille, Patrick and Montavont, Nicolas and Douligeris, Christos},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/URAPMILT/Zorbas et al. - 2018 - Improving LoRa Network Capacity Using Multiple Spr.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985056056,"version":0,"updated":1563985949956},"$loki":3140},{"itemID":4957,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{sutton_zippy_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Seoul, South Korea}},\n  title = {Zippy: {{On}}-{{Demand Network Flooding}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-3631-4},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2809695.2809705},\n  doi = {10.1145/2809695.2809705},\n  shorttitle = {Zippy},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the challenge of rapidly disseminating rare events through a multi-hop network, while achieving unprecedented energy-efficiency.

As a consequence, data breaches are expected to increase in gravity and occurrence. To counteract unintended data disclosure, a great deal of effort has been dedicated in devising methods for uncovering privacy leaks. Existing solutions, however, have not addressed the time- and data-intensive nature of leak detection. The shift from hardware-specific implementation to software-based solutions is the core idea behind the concept of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). On the other hand, the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm is characterized by the decoupling of the forwarding and control planes. In this paper, an SDN/NFV-enabled architecture is proposed for improving the efficiency of leak detection systems. Employing a previously developed identification strategy, Personally Identifiable Information detector (PIID) and load balancer VNFs are packaged and deployed in OpenStack through an NFV MANO. Meanwhile, SDN controllers permit the load balancer to dynamically redistribute traffic among the PIID instances. In a physical testbed, tests are conducted to evaluate the proposed architecture. Experimental results indicate that the proportions of forwarding and parsing on total overhead is influenced by the traffic intensity. Furthermore, an NFV-enabled system with scalability features was found to outperform a nonvirtualized implementation in terms of latency (85.1\\%), packet loss (98.3\\%) and throughput (8.41\\%).},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Go, Sharleen Joy Y and Guinto, Richard and Festin, Cedric Angelo M and Austria, Isabel and Ocampo, Roel and Tan, Wilson M},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/LUKRACEH/Go et al. - An SDNNFV-Enabled Architecture for Detecting Pers.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985056114,"version":0,"updated":1563985950298},"$loki":3142},{"itemID":4742,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pujolle_cell_2019l,\n  title = {{{CELL TD}}-{{Cell}}-{{GP}}},\n  date = {2019},\n  author = {Pujolle},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ERU394NI/TD-Cell-GP.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985056562,"version":0,"updated":1563985949852},"$loki":3143},{"itemID":5579,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{lee_ambient_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Ambient {{Environment Recognition Algorithm Fusing Vision}} and {{LiDAR Sensors}} for {{Robust Multi}}-Channel {{V2X System}}},\n  abstract = {Recently, 5G commercialization issues and standardization of WAVE communication have been done on V2X communication of autonomous vehicles.

Detection of community structure in real networks is vital in terms of both theoretical and practical value. Many community detection methods are derived from specific backgrounds and their reliability is still questionable. Researchers hardly focus on the general definition of communities and the general community detection algorithms. The discrepancy between the two might pose some obstacles to the optimization of them so that it is hard to use one algorithm to perfect the other. Recently, Lu et al. [1] have proposed a general method for constructing network model from the real-world problem.

The current spectrum access process of legacy WLANs uses clear channel assessment (CCA) and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), where the spectrum is sensed before use and a random binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanism is employed for collision avoidance. While LAA uses a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism, moderately similar to the CCA CSMA/CA for channel access. However, there is a fairness issue when these two technologies coexist. In this paper, we propose a channel observation-based LBT (CoLBT) mechanism for fairness in LAAWi-Fi coexistence scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a more realistic practical channel observation-based collision probability observed by the LAA evolved Node B (eNB) to adaptively scale-up and scale-down the backoff contention window for channel contention, to reduce the waste of resources and improve LAAWiFi coexistence performance. Simulation results validate that the proposed CoLBT mechanism is effective in LAA-WiFi coexistence scenario and can improve fairness performance, compared with the current mechanism of LBT.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {154-158},\n  author = {Ali, Rashid and Shahin, Nurullah and Musaddiq, Arslan and Kim, Byung-Seo and Kim, Sung Won},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/CSIL7EYB/Ali et al. - 2018 - Fair and Efficient Channel Observation-Based Liste.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985060162,"version":0,"updated":1563985950494},"$loki":3165},{"itemID":6116,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{jalalzai_proteus_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Proteus: {{A Scalable BFT Consensus Protocol}} for {{Blockchains}}},\n  abstract = {Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus exhibits higher throughput in comparison to Proof of Work (PoW) in blockchains.

Previously, proposed solutions improve BFT performance for normal operation, but will fall back to quadratic message complexity once the protocol observes a certain number of failures. To address this issue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a subset of nodes c as a root committee. Proteus guarantees stable performance, regardless of the number of failures in the network and it improves on the quadratic message complexity of typical BFT-based protocols to O(cn) messages, where c {$<<$} n, for large number of nodes n. We tested our protocol on 200 Amazon EC2 instances, with two different baseline BFT protocols (PBFT and Bchain) for comparison.

Within this family of possible technology choices, two different branches have emerged: the standards based on spreaded wideband communication and the standards based on narrowband communication, both promising to reach long range connectivity at very low power. More specifically, this paper focuses on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This paper presents a detailed model of CSS, showing that the symbols are not perfectly orthogonal. The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufficient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2016-11},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  keywords = {SF},\n  author = {Reynders, Brecht and Pollin, Sofie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WMB5B87Q/Reynders and Pollin - 2016 - Chirp spread spectrum as a modulation technique fo.pdf},\n  note = {00051}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985061204,"version":0,"updated":1563985949522},"$loki":3171},{"itemID":4400,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{hejazi_survey_2018,\n  location = {{Eger}},\n  title = {Survey of Platforms for Massive {{IoT}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-1208-8},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8325598/},\n  doi = {10.1109/FIOT.2018.8325598},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Future IoT Technologies}} ({{Future IoT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Future IoT Technologies}} ({{Future IoT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-16},\n  date = {2018-01},\n  pages = {1-8},\n  author = {Hejazi, Hamdan and Rajab, Husam and Cinkler, Tibor and Lengyel, Laszlo},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/H6UDRLX6/Hejazi et al_2018_Survey of platforms for massive IoT.pdf},\n  note = {00009}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985061234,"version":0,"updated":1563985949624},"$loki":3172},{"itemID":5636,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{suarez_talk_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Talk {{Half Listen To Half}}: {{Energy}}-{{Efficient Neighbor Discovery}} in {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Due to the combination of constrained power, low duty cycle, and high mobility, neighbor discovery is one of the most challenging problems in wireless sensor networks.

The difference between it and the existing congestion control algorithm is that it is derived from actual congestions. BBR measures the bottleneck bandwidth and round-trip propagation time sequentially and sends data based on bandwidth delay product (BDP). The mere dependence on the BDP unfairly allocates a larger part of the bandwidth to a flow with long RTT than a short RTT flow. This nature of the BBR entirely conflicts with the trend of traditional TCP where a short RTT flow is more vibrant than long RTT flow. To solve this problem, we previously proposed the bottleneck queue buildup suppression method and verified that through NS-3. However, during the testbed experiments, we found that the previous method was unstable and led to unexpected results. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an improved version of the previously proposed algorithm. We confirmed through extensive testbed experiments that our proposed BBR-E improves fairness between the flows with different RTTs and ensures better throughput.},\n  pages = {3},\n  author = {Kim, Geon-Hwan and Song, Yeong-Jun and Mahmud, Imtiaz and Cho, You-Ze},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/LBGNC98K/Kim et al. - Enhanced BBR Congestion Control Algorithm for Impr.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985061790,"version":0,"updated":1563985950324},"$loki":3177},{"itemID":5834,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{jang_mobility_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Mobility {{Modeling}} and {{Analysis}} in {{Mobile Communication Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437045/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437045},\n  abstract = {In the previous work by Wang et al.

The main standard, IEEE802.15.4e 2012, introduces a deterministic and synchronous multi-channel extension (DSME) model. Three main issues should be tackled and improved with this model; a high energy consumption of end nodes during the contention access period (CAP), a long association and guaranteed time slot (GTS) earning times during a network initialization phase and a long network discovery time. These issues have been analysed and improved in a star topology wireless sensor network (WSN). Four scenarios with different numbers of nodes are investigated. Nodes numbers are set according to network saturation ratios (25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%). This paper proposes three enhancements for the performance of this model. Two new approaches are proposed to reduce the energy consumption of end nodes during the CAP period, a new association scheme during network initialization phase using a tight TDMA algorithm to minimize the time required for association and getting a GTS slot and reduce power consumption due to collisions, and a new technique to reduce network discovery time. Simulation results show significant improvements in reducing energy consumption and radio duty cycle (RDC) of end nodes by a factor of (71) and (77) respectively. Good improvements are also achieved in reducing association and GTS earning times by a factor of (8) on average. Finally, network discovery time has been reduced for fast association and further energy saving of end nodes.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {426-431},\n  author = {Alsudany, Sameer K. and Boussakta, Said and Johnston, Martin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TBGVGQTU/Alsudany et al. - 2018 - Enhancements of IEEE802.15.4e DSME Model of Wirele.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985063476,"version":0,"updated":1563985950612},"$loki":3182},{"itemID":4358,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{sudhakar_fair_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Fair Service Matching Agent for Federated Cloud},\n  volume = {76},\n  issn = {00457906},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045790618332282},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.compeleceng.2019.03.002},\n  journaltitle = {Computers \\& Electrical Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Computers \\& Electrical Engineering},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2019-06},\n  pages = {13-23},\n  author = {Sudhakar, S. and Nithya, N.S. and Radhakrishnan, B.L.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/ASLA6X8P/Sudhakar et al_2019_Fair service matching agent for federated cloud.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985063902,"version":0,"updated":1563985949572},"$loki":3183},{"itemID":4693,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_cell_,\n  title = {{{CELL ETSI G5}} Technology He {{European}} Approach},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/N3PQREL2/ETSI_G5_technology_the_European_approach.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985063918,"version":0,"updated":1563985949800},"$loki":3184},{"itemID":5560,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{choi_networking_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Networking Framework}} for {{Multiple}}- {{Heterogeneous Unmanned Vehicles}} in {{FANETs}}},\n  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) cooperation scenario has gained a great amount of interests because it is possible to support various scenarios based on their different characteristics of unmanned vehicle systems.

Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones).

These devices are usually battery operated and have a radio transceiver that is typically their most power-hungry block. Wake-up radio schemes can be used to achieve a reasonable balance among energy consumption, range, data receiving capabilities and response time. In this paper, a high-sensitivity low power wake-up radio receiver (WUR) for wireless sensor networks is presented. The wake-up radio is comprised of a fully passive differential RF-toDC converter that rectifies the incident RF signal, a low-power comparator and an ultra low power microcontroller to detects the envelope of the on-off keying (OOK) wake-up data used as address. We designed and implemented a novel low power tunable wake up radio with addressing capability, a minimal power consumption of only 196nW and a maximum sensitivity of -55dBm and minimal wake up time of 130{$\\mu$}s without addressing and around 1,6ms with 2byte addressing at 10Kbit/s data rate. The flexibility of the solution makes the wake up radio suitable for both power constrained low range application (such as Body Area Network) or applications with long range needs. The wake up radio can work also at different frequencies and the addressing capability directly on board helps reduce false positives. Experimental on field results demonstrate the low power of the solution, the high sensitivity and the functionality.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{IEEE}} 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{IEEE}} 10th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-28},\n  date = {2014-10},\n  pages = {92-99},\n  author = {Magno, Michele and Benini, Luca},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/4N2XTWE6/Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/I2ZFEJCV/Magno and Benini - 2014 - An ultra low power high sensitivity wake-up radio .pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985067774,"version":0,"updated":1563985949966},"$loki":3203},{"itemID":5003,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{duda_wishwalt_2018,\n  title = {{{WiSH}}-{{WalT}}: {{A Framework}} for {{Controllable}} and {{Reproducible LoRa Testbeds}}},\n  shorttitle = {{{WiSH}}-{{WalT}}},\n  booktitle = {{{IEEE PIMRC}}},\n  date = {2018},\n  author = {Duda, Andrzej and Lone, Qasim and Duble, Etienne and Rousseau, Franck and Moerman, Ingrid and Giannoulis, Spilios},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/TJZJPHU5/Duda et al_2018_WiSH-WalT.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985067804,"version":0,"updated":1563985950074},"$loki":3204},{"itemID":5729,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{go_relay_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Relay {{Position Considering Interference}} from {{Other Sub}}-{{Channels}} in {{D2D Group}}-Casting {{Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437023/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437023},\n  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a way to communicate directly between devices without going through the base station or other infrastructure.

Although sub-channels in OFDMA systems are theoretically orthogonal, there is non-negligible interference from other sub-channels due to in-band emission.

To this end, we naturally extend the definition of sample complexity so that it makes sense in the switching best arm setting, which may be of independent interest.

In our previous research we have devised an Information Flow security model that gives the vertices and edges numerical attributes, based on their user credibility and connection strength, such as age of user account and the friendship duration of two users, from which we have assessed the level of information sharing willingness of an ego node to users that are not directly connected to it, thus categorizing them as adversaries or acquaintances. In this research we use this model to generate a trustworthy network of users by creating a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph instance and iterating the removal of the weak-attributed edges and their connected vertices.

They are time-based, with pre-configured pattern and expensive cameras. Although traffic lights can communicate wirelessly with incoming vehicles, they are less adapted to an urban environment. If we consider light signs as an Internet of Things (IoT) network, one issue is to model thoroughly the change of signs' states and the Quality of Service (QoS) of this network. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of Urban Traffic Light Control based on an IoT network (IoT-UTLC). The objective is to interconnect both roads' infrastructures and traffic lights through an IoT platform. We designed our IoT-UTLC by selecting motes and protocols of wireless sensor network (WSN). Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has been integrated to manage QoS. It enables lights to adapt remotely to any situation and smoothly interrupt traffic light's classic cycles. Our experimental results show that the MQTT protocol is efficient when the packets rate exceeds 35\\% of traffic flow, it reduces traffic delay up to 0.05s at 90\\% of congestion. After verification and validation of our solution using a UPPAAL model checker, our system has been prototyped. Motes' functions have been implemented on Contiki OS and connected via a 6LoWPAN/IEEE 802.15.4 network. Timestamping messages have been performed throughout the system to evaluate the MQTT protocol with different QoS levels. In our experiments, we measured the Round-trip delay time (RTT) of messages exchanged between the WSN and IoT Cloud.

One of the major efforts to meet it is the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP(DASH) standard. However, its performance heavily depends on the client's adaptive quality selection algorithm that is not included in the standard. The existing conventional algorithms are basically based on a procedural algorithm that is not easy to capture and reflect all variations of dynamic network and traffic conditions in real network environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel quality selection mechanism based on the Deep Q-Network(DQN) model, the DQN-based DASH ABR(\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend\\dbend{} ) mechanism.

Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, thus moving the control logic from the node to a central controller. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature. Moreover, it delves into some of the challenges facing this paradigm, as well as the major SDWSN design requirements that need to be considered to address these challenges.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {1872-1899},\n  author = {Kobo, H.

When such networks have multiple IP domains between the external gateway and internal networks, domains that are lower in the hierarchy become more secure, but at the cost of flexibility. Our proposed system architecture aims to increase communication flexibility in such networks without requiring complex encapsulation and achieves this goal via a practical method that does not change the packet size.

In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions.

Unlike the half-duplex (HD) cellular systems, the extra residual self-interference (RSI) and the cochannel interference (CCI) are involved in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) received signals due to the simultaneous transmission and reception in an FD base station (BS). Accordingly, we aim at developing the UL and DL precoders to suppress the influence of the RSI and CCI, where the EE criterion is adopted to reach the goal of the green communication. However, the EE precoder design is a fractional non-convex problem. To find the tractable solution, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) method to conduct the DL and UL precoders iteratively. For given DL precoders, the closed-form solution of UL precoders can be eventually yielded by an iterative water-filling (IWF) procedure. Nevertheless, the similar method cannot directly be applied to optimize the DL precoders. We then resort to the UL-DL duality that transfers the DL precoder design to an equivalent UL precoder design problem. We further apply the primal-dual decomposition to the DL precoder design and solve it by the IWF algorithm.

We have previously proposed a minimum mean square error (MMSE) location estimation method using multiple items of sensed information as well the received signal power and shown that its estimation errors are smaller than those of the conventional method using only the received signal power. Machine learning has recently become attractive as an optimization algorithm, and in this paper we propose to apply machine learning with a back propagation method for indoor location estimation using multiple items of sensed information. Our proposed machine learning location estimation method is experimentally validated and compared with the MMSE method. The machine learning location estimation method was found to reduce the standard deviation of the location estimation error and increase the probability that the estimated distance is within 2.5 m of the actual distance.},\n  pages = {4},\n  author = {Kudoh, Eisuke},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/2FSFLW9W/Kudoh - Location Estimation Applying Machine Learning Usin.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985073546,"version":0,"updated":1563985950328},"$loki":3245},{"itemID":5874,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{choi_hierarchical_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Hierarchical {{Trust Chain Framework}} for {{IoT Services}}},\n  abstract = {To support blockchain enabled Internet of Things (IoT) services, a lightweight approach is necessary in order to reduce the processing overhead and memory redundancy.

The result of the charge measured in the charging EV can be different from the charge amount claimed to be charged in the charging station. This is because the charge is measured separately from each other using its smart meters. And if mechanical measurements are assumed to be accurate, it is possible to lie in one of the EV or charging station. Also, billing information can be manipulated. To prevent those problems, this paper proposes the blockchain based billing system. The EV and the charging station store the billing information in the blockchain after mutual authentication and prevent the modification. A blockchain is the system in which all nodes have the same ledger, therefore cannot be tampered with.

In this paper, we implemented the lightweight block cipher CHAM released ICISC 2017 in javascript. IN addition, the computation speed is increased by reducing the number of operations. The proposed technique is experiented in various web browser environments, such as Goggle Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. It is confirmed that the encryption is faster than the normal algorithm.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {774-778},\n  author = {Park, Chanhui and Park, Taehwan and Seo, Hwajeong and Kim, Howon},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/5G27PP5S/Park et al. - 2018 - Optimization of CHAM Encryption Algorithm Based on.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985075682,"version":0,"updated":1563985950922},"$loki":3261},{"itemID":6458,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bialon_impact_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {On the {{Impact}} of {{Device Characteristics}} on {{Opportunistic Network Performance}}},\n  abstract = {With smartphones gaining relevance in everyone's regular day more than ever, the application of opportunistic networks on those devices has become a popular field of research, as it enables smartphones to connect locally with high bandwidth and to provide networked applications for regional use.

Challenges are brought up by missing ad-hoc communication possibilities and system architecture constraints. Through tethering hotspot-based communication it is possible to create opportunistic networks for smartphones, although with specific network characteristics. We conduct a survey on the impact of device characteristics and network transmission properties on the overall network performance. Using the ONE simulator, we deploy a tethering hotspot-based connection strategy and, as the main contribution of this paper, asses the influence of single device properties onto the global opportunistic network performance.

LPWAN devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multi-hop network. However, to ensure efficient and reliable communication LPWAN devices often provide a large number of transmission parameters. For example, a LoRa device can be configured to use different spreading factors, bandwidth settings, coding rates and transmission powers, resulting in over 6720 possible settings. It is a challenge to determine the setting that minimises transmission energy cost while meeting the required communication performance. This paper is the first to present a thorough analysis of the impact of LoRa transmission parameter selection on communication performance. We study in detail the impact of parameter settings on energy consumption and communication reliability. Using this study we develop a link probing regime which enables us to quickly determine transmission settings that satisfy performance requirements. The presented work is a first step towards an automated mechanism for LoRa transmission parameter selection that a deployed LoRa network requires, but is not yet specified within the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) framework.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Distributed Computing}} in {{Sensor Systems}} ({{DCOSS}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Distributed Computing}} in {{Sensor Systems}} ({{DCOSS}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-06-30},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {27-34},\n  author = {Bor, Martin and Roedig, Utz},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MXY9SFZN/Bor and Roedig - 2017 - LoRa Transmission Parameter Selection.pdf},\n  note = {00042}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985076192,"version":0,"updated":1563985950032},"$loki":3264},{"itemID":5833,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{mahn-suk_performance_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Performance {{Test}} of {{LTE}}-{{R Railway Wireless Communication}} at {{High}}-{{Speed}} (350 Km/h) {{Environments}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8437021/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437021},\n  abstract = {LTE-Railway (LTE-R) is a communication technology that enables immediate and effective response in case of emergencies by providing voice, data, and video services through LTE, a 4thgeneration wireless communication technology, optimized for the railway environment.

In the field of face recognition, researches using DNN have been carried out. However, face adversarial example is a serious threat in face recognition system. Face adversarial example adding a little of noise to the original face image can cause the misrecognition in the face recognition system. For example, an attacker intentionally modifies a face image with small distortion, which could cause the face recognition system to misidentify another person. It also shows the possibility of wrong recognition by another person when it is modulated by several points on the face. However, the concept of face friendsafe adversarial example can be useful in a military situation where friend and enemy forces are mixed. In the face recognition field, face friend-safe adversarial example may be needed that is correctly recognized by a friend face recognition system and misidentified by an enemy face recognition system. In this paper, we propose a face friend-safe adversarial example targeting the FaceNet face recognition system. The proposed scheme generates a face friend-safe adversarial example that is misrecognized by a enemy face recognition system but is correctly recognized by friend face recognition system with minimum distortion.

Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler's objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T . To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T . This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward ``variation'' and the minimal achievable regret, and by establishing a connection between the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},\n  booktitle = NIPS,\n  date = {2014},\n  author = {Gur, Yonatan and Zeevi, Assaf J. and Besbes, Omar},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/USD3V3PR/Gur et al_2014_Stochastic Multi-Armed-Bandit Problem with Non-stationary Rewards.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985076884,"version":0,"updated":1563985949510},"$loki":3268},{"itemID":4804,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{toldov_adaptive_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Adaptive {{MAC}} Layer for Interference Limited {{WSN}}},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {148},\n  author = {Toldov, Viktor},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/NR8DFCS5/Toldov - Adaptive MAC layer for interference limited WSN.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985076900,"version":0,"updated":1563985949924},"$loki":3269},{"itemID":5740,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kang_study_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {A {{Study}} on the {{Effect}} of {{Moving}} Small Cell in {{Heterogeneous Networks}} with {{Interference Cancellation}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436766/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436766},\n  abstract = {Wireless data traffic is growing exponentially with the spread of smartphones and tablet PCs.

It provides unconditional secure communication based on the laws of physics. From the viewpoint of network research, QKD is considered to be a component for providing secure communication in network systems. A QKD network enables each node to exchange encryption keys with arbitrary nodes. However previous research did not focus on the processing speed of the key management method essential for a QKD network. This paper focuses on the key management method assuming a high-speed QKD system for which we clarify the design, propose a high-speed method, and evaluate the throughput. The proposed method consists of four modules: (1) local key manager handling the keys generated by QKD, (2) one-time pad tunnel manager establishing the transparent encryption link, (3) global key manager generating the keys for application communication, and (4) web API providing keys to the application. The proposed method was implemented in software and evaluated by emulating QKD key generation and application key consumption. The evaluation result reveals that it is capable of handling the encryption keys at a speed of 414 Mb/s, 185 Mb/s, 85 Mb/s and 971 Mb/s, for local key manager, one-time pad tunnel manager, global key manager and web API, respectively. These are sufficient for integration with a high-speed QKD system. Furthermore, the method allows the high-speed QKD system consisting of two nodes to expand corresponding to the size of the QKD network without losing the speed advantage.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Takahashi, Ririka and Tanizawa, Yoshimichi and Dixon, Alexander},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/E99P9AEB/Takahashi et al. - A high-speed key management method for quantum key.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985077364,"version":0,"updated":1563985950362},"$loki":3274},{"itemID":4647,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{friedman_multimedia_2004,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Multim\\'edia et {{Qualit\\'e}} de {{Service}}: C2},\n  date = {2004},\n  pages = {65},\n  author = {Friedman, Timur},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SGCVZ8XI/Friedman - 2004 - M2 Informatique Réseaux Multimédia et Qualité de S.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985077744,"version":0,"updated":1563985949788},"$loki":3275},{"itemID":5669,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{kim_indoor_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague}},\n  title = {Indoor {{Semantic Segmentation}} for {{Robot Navigating}} on {{Mobile}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436956/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436956},\n  abstract = {In recent years, there have been many successes of using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) in the task of pixel-level classification (also called \"semantic image segmentation\").

We apply a system called 'Mobile DeepLabv3', which uses atrous convolution when applying semantic image segmentation by using MobileNetV2 as a network backbone.

One solution of this dilemma is to establish a blockchain network with shards. In this paper, we focus on the blockchain network with shards and adopt the security-deposit based consensus protocol, studying the problem of how to balance the security incentive and the economic incentive. Also, the inherent features of the blockchain, i.e., anonymity and decentralization, introduce the information asymmetric issue between the beacon chain and the participants. The contract theory is utilized to formulate the problem between them. As such, the optimal rewards related to the different types of validators can be obtained, as well as the reasonable deposits accordingly. Compared with the fixed deposits, the flexible deposits can provide enough economic incentive for the participants without losing the security incentives. Besides, the simulation results demonstrate that the contract theory approach is capable of maximizing the beacon chain's utility and satisfying the incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the participants.},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Li, Jing},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/G4ECPMZA/Li - Contract-Based Approach for Security Deposit in Bl.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985077826,"version":0,"updated":1563985951058},"$loki":3278},{"itemID":4582,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{briante_supporting_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Supporting Augmented Floating Car Data through Smartphone-Based Crowd-Sensing},\n  volume = {1},\n  issn = {22142096},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214209614000412},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.vehcom.2014.08.002},\n  abstract = {Over the last few years, academia, governmental agencies, automotive and electronic industries have increased their interest in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and services.

For example, the LoRa radio protocol enables connecting remote sensors at a distance as long as ten kilometers in a line-of-sight. However, the large area covered also brings several difficulties, such as the placement of sensing devices in regards to topology in geography, or the variability of communication latency. Sensing the environment also carries constraints related to the interest of sensing points in relation to a physical phenomenon. Thus, criteria for designs are evolving a lot from the existing methods, especially in complex terrains. This article describes simulation techniques based on geography analysis to compute long-range radio coverages and radio characteristics in these situations. As radio propagation is just a particular case of physical phenomena, it is shown how a unified approach also allows for characterizing the behavior of potential physical risks. The case of heavy rainfall and flooding is investigated. Geography analysis is achieved using segmentation tools to produce cellular systems which are in turn translated into code for high-performance computations. The paper provides results from practical complex terrain experiments using LoRa, which confirm the accuracy of the simulation, and scheduling characteristics for sample networks.

The common practice of clinical treatment is gradually being overhauled by ubiquitous healthcare systems. The wireless body area networks (WBANs) are becoming increasingly important for future healthcare applications. According to the human physiological information, WBAN not only sends the real-time notification to the user but also decreases the transmission delay of patient information to the physician for medical decision. When medical emergency information must be transmitted after a disaster occurrence, the number of WBANs and emergency traffic increase in the particular area. In the situations, a large number of WBANs may be close to each other, thus causing inter-WBAN interference and increasing the transmission delay. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dynamic channel selection scheme (DCSS) in IEEE 802.15.6 WBANs. DCSS records the channel interference degree which is used to adaptively select the best transmission channel and to effectively transmit data.

For massive IoT data acquisition, a gateway-based data aggregation approach is commonly used featuring sensor/ actuator seamless access and providing cache/ buffering and preprocessing functionality. In this perspective, gateways acting as producers need to allocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is proposed a Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework (PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources between aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules IoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally,  the framework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled backbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users and consumers. Network resources are allocated using a Bandwidth Allocation Model (BAM) to achieve efficient network resource allocation for scheduled IoT data streams. PSIoT-Orch adopts an ICN (Information-Centric Network) PubSub architecture approach to handle IoT data transfers requests among framework components. The proposed framework aims at gathering the inherent advantages of an ICN-centric approach using a PubSub message scheme while allocating resources efficiently keeping QoS awareness and handling restricted network resources (bandwidth) for massive IoT traffic.},\n  journaltitle = Zenodo,\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2018-01-10},\n  author = {Moraes, Pedro Francesco and Reale, Rafael F. and Martins, Joberto S.

Considering back-off power control, information signal of near user is split into two data streams for uplink transmissions, whereas information signal of far user is transmitted without rate splitting. In the FRS scheme, a fixed power allocation factor is applied at near user for allocating transmit power between data streams. At the BS receiver, successive interference cancellation is applied for recovering all data streams. Motivated by cognitive radio principles, a dynamic power allocation factor is designed for the ARS scheme based on instantaneous channel state information. Closed-form expressions are derived for outage probabilities of the near and far users, respectively.

It is also shown that our proposed algorithm is fast enough to be used in real time.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {654-659},\n  author = {Choi, Myungwhan and Rubenecia, Areeya and Choi, Hyo Hyun},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/P946W3WC/Choi et al. - 2018 - Reservation-Based Cooperative Intersection Crossin.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985083018,"version":0,"updated":1563985950770},"$loki":3306},{"itemID":3334,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{zaldivar_providing_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Bonn, Germany}},\n  title = {Providing Accident Detection in Vehicular Networks through {{OBD}}-{{II}} Devices and {{Android}}-Based Smartphones},\n  isbn = {978-1-61284-928-7 978-1-61284-926-3 978-1-61284-927-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6115556/},\n  doi = {10.1109/LCN.2011.6115556},\n  abstract = {The increasing activity in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) area faces a strong limitation: the slow pace at which the automotive industry is making cars \"smarter\". On the contrary, the smartphone industry is advancing quickly. Existing smartphones are endowed with multiple wireless interfaces and high computational power, being able to perform a wide variety of tasks. By combining smartphones with existing vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and services when driving. In this paper we propose an Androidbased application that monitors the vehicle through an On Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) interface, being able to detect accidents. Our proposed application estimates the G force experienced by the passengers in case of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to detect accidents. The application reacts to positive detection by sending details about the accident through either e-mail or SMS to pre-defined destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone call to the emergency services. Experimental results using a real vehicle show that the application is able to react to accident events in less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{IEEE}} 36th {{Conference}} on {{Local Computer Networks}} ({{LCN}} 2011)},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{IEEE}} 36th {{Conference}} on {{Local Computer Networks}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-10},\n  pages = {813-819},\n  author = {Zaldivar, Jorge and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/WB5YVW29/Zaldivar et al_2011_Providing accident detection in vehicular networks through OBD-II devices and.pdf},\n  note = {00189}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985084954,"version":0,"updated":1563985949126},"$loki":3307},{"itemID":4981,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{cattani_experimental_2017,\n  title = {An Experimental Evaluation of the Reliability of Lora Long-Range Low-Power Wireless Communication},\n  volume = {6},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks},\n  shortjournal = {J.

In the competition, between 8-10 autonomous vehicles formed two platoons in different lanes and were required to merge into a predefined competition zone. The performance is characterized using CAM CCDFs which serves as a base for the evaluation of a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control application. Two important effects has been identified that affect to the reliability of the communications. Firstly, there is a degradation with the distance that appears to be stronger for cars and more gentle for trucks. This indicates that occlusions heavily affect the connectivity of ITS-G5A. Secondly, the reliability is below expectations and some of the vehicles perform consistently worse than others. Although further investigation is required, a possible explanation for this is that a highly congested channel is making some of the vehicles get stuck and are not able to regularly access the channel.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-23},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {1899-1903},\n  author = {Parra, Ignacio and Garcia-Morcillo, Alvaro and Izquierdo, Ruben and Alonso, Javier and Fernandez-Llorca, D. and Sotelo, M.A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/MJX82H6U/Parra et al. - 2017 - Analysis of ITS-G5A V2X communications performance.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985085488,"version":0,"updated":1563985949684},"$loki":3312},{"itemID":5157,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{brown_4g_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{4G}} \\& {{5G}}-{{Ready Network Slicing}}},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {12},\n  author = {Brown, Gabriel},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/E29LA8DN/Brown - 2017 - 4G & 5G-Ready Network Slicing.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985085504,"version":0,"updated":1563985950136},"$loki":3313},{"itemID":5677,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_efficient_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Efficient {{Reconciliation Protocol}} with {{Polar Codes}} for {{Quantum Key Distribution}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436787/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436787},\n  abstract = {Information reconciliation is a critical process of any Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, where two legitimate parties agree on a secret key.

The conventional base station is broken down into a Remote Radio Head (RRH) and a Base Band Unit (BBU). The RRHs are geographically scattered across multiple sites, whereas the BBUs are sheltered in a data center. In this context, deciding to which RRH users connect is known as the user association problem. As a function of network load conditions, some RRHs may be turned off, reducing network power consumption. Furthermore, RRHs may be mapped to a single BBU, achieving statistical multiplexing gain. Deciding what RRHs are grouped together is known as the RRH clustering problem. Traditionally, user association and RRH clustering are independently addressed. As these two problems are mutually dependent, we provide in this paper a framework for the joint optimization of the user association and the RRH clustering. Our objective is to minimize both the network power consumption and the total transmission delay. As this problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem, it can be solved through exhaustive search. However, the computational complexity becomes intractable as the network size increases. Therefore, we decouple our joint problem into two sub-problems. These sub-problems are iteratively solved until convergence. We further evaluate the performance of our proposed solution. Simulation results show that our optimal solution for the RRH clustering sub-problem outperforms the no-clustering solution, where one BBU is exclusively dedicated to each RRH, and the grand coalition solution, where all RRHs are associated with a single BBU.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{Tenth International Conference}} on {{Ubiquitous}} and {{Future Networks}} ({{ICUFN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-07-17},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {376-381},\n  author = {Taleb, Hussein and Helou, Melhem El and Khawam, Kinda and Lahoud, Samer and Martin, Steven},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/SPWG8QVA/Taleb et al. - 2018 - Joint User Association and RRH Clustering in Cloud.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985086464,"version":0,"updated":1563985950586},"$loki":3321},{"itemID":5903,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lee_analysis_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {An {{Analysis}} of an {{RF Link Budget}} and {{RSSI Circuit Design}} for {{Long}}-{{Range Communications}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436624/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436624},\n  abstract = {It is important for vehicle drivers to obtain useful information through systems such as a global positioning system (GPS), an intelligent transportation system (ITS), or WiFi data communication.

In this paper, network slicing is investigated in LoRa networks over fixed and dynamic slicing strategies. The performance of LoRa slices is evaluated with different spreading factor (SF) configurations. Then, a dynamic inter-slicing algorithm is proposed based on a maximum likelihood estimation that avoids resource starvation and prioritizes a slice over another depending on its QoS requirements. Moreover, a novel intra-slicing strategy is proposed that maximizes resource allocation efficiency of LoRa slices with regard to their delay requirements. An energy module for LoRa in NS3 is also implemented to evaluate the energy consumption of devices in each slice.

However, a major disadvantage in deployment of Non-Orthogonal UFMC is the high Peakto-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) being comparable to that of OFDMA. As such, additional PAPR reduction techniques are required for reducing the dynamic range of power amplifier deployed in communication system. We take up Power Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) in which available power is sliced between users and investigate the performance of SC-FDMA for PDNOMA UFMC systems for PAPR reduction. UFMC is known to provide additional diversity to transmitter in uplink and facilitates relaxed synchronization at the receiver side in downlink scenario.

However, BER performance of proposed system in AWGN channel is seen to be traded off as the extent of SC-FDMA precoding increases.

The sequences with unpredictably complex rules create a basis image and the basis image is XOR-computed with the original image.

Advances in MAC protocols have enabled significant lifetime improvements, but in systems with low data rate, idle listening, and other communication artifacts can begin to dominate costs. One proposal to combat this is the addition of a second, extremely low power radio component that is always-on. As a consequence of the extremely low power, such radios are incapable of decoding general data, and thus are often delegated the task of listening for a trigger, leading to the terminology wake-up radio, as this extremely low power radio is used to wake up a higher power radio, which is then used for data communication. While wake-up technology has been steadily evolving over the last decade in the hardware arena, few protocols have been developed to exploit it. In this work, we present WaCo, our wake-up radio COOJA extension that allows exploration of the capabilities of the wake-up radio from the desktop environment. We also use our extended simulator to concretely show the potential benefits of the wake-up radio hardware with two, standard data collection protocols. Our results simultaneously confirm that wake-up technology has tremendous potential and that our simulator extension provides an effective mechanism for such exploration.},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Piyare, Timofei Istomin Rajeev},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/6DFT7MCS/Piyare - WaCo A Wake-Up Radio COOJA Extension for Simulati.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985089858,"version":0,"updated":1563985950016},"$loki":3336},{"itemID":5155,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{brown_5g_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{5G Service Velocity}} \\& the {{Distributed Cloud}}},\n  pages = {13},\n  author = {Brown, Gabriel},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/9N5VG6DC/Brown - 5G Service Velocity & the Distributed Cloud.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985089874,"version":0,"updated":1563985950132},"$loki":3337},{"itemID":5826,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{cho_determination_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Prague, Czech Republic}},\n  title = {Determination of {{Optimum Threshold Values}} for {{NPRACH Preamble Detection}} in {{NB}}-{{IoT Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4646-5},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8436646/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436646},\n  abstract = {In this paper, we describe the NPRACH of 3GPP NBIoT system and propose a possible receiver algorithm for NPRACH detection and timing advance estimation.

The advantage of the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the behaviors of traffic lights in terms of the conditions and events that cause phase alternations. Moreover, the size of the urban traffic network control system can be easily extended with our proposed modular technique. An analysis of the control models is performed via a reachability graph method to demonstrate how the models enforce the transitions of the traffic lights.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures.

In addition, it is of increasing interest to researchers, which a group of drones are networked and coordinated to accomplish a mission delivered from Ground Control Station (GCS). To support those service scenarios, communication path should be maintained between GCS and the UAVs, and the UAVs should be able to exchange a message among themselves. However, communication range between GCS and the UAVs is bounded according to the transceiver power and its sensitivity. Hence, a multihop network approach need to be considered. In such multihop networks, routing protocol plays an important role. Accordingly, in this paper, we present a geolocation-based routing protocol for Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs) with multihop network communication. Our protocol shows robust and resilient performance to the dynamic multihop network topology. A network topology composed of UAVs is highly dynamic due to the high speed of UAVs while executing missions. In this circumstance, our protocol uses geolocation information of neighbors and then find the routing path to the destination by only considering the neighbor information, which in turn, results in low overhead and robustness to the dynamic network topology in FANETs.

The fraction of time that the radio in ON is called duty cycle and low duty cycle schedule could help save energy. Most works focus on designing efficient discovery schedule under a pre-defined low duty cycle such that the neighboring nodes can discover each other in a short time. In this paper, we study a more practical problem where each node could adjust the duty cycle dynamically by the remaining energy or the subsequent tasks, which is referred to as adjustable neighbor discovery.

We propose a model for the combined deployment of multiple choreographies on top of a shared set of services, and we further investigate the problem through experiments.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Service}}-{{Oriented}} and {{Cloud Computing}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {153-165},\n  author = {Gomes, Raphael and Lima, J\\'unio and Costa, F\\'abio and family=Rocha, given=Ricardo, prefix=da, useprefix=true and Georgantas, Nikolaos},\n  editor = {Celesti, Antonio and Leitner, Philipp},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/NPZUDYD2/Gomes et al. - 2016 - A Model-Based Approach for the Pragmatic Deploymen.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985096342,"version":0,"updated":1563985949616},"$loki":3364},{"itemID":4528,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kifouche_ieee_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{IEEE Wireless Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{WCNC}} 2019)},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {16},\n  author = {Kifouche, Abdenour and Hamouche, Redha and Kocik, Remy and Rachedi, Abderrezak and Baudoin, Genevieve},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/iot/storage/GQXFPU7R/Kifouche et al. - IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Confer.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":12,"created":1563985096364,"version":0,"updated":1563985949700},"$loki":3365},{"itemID":6373,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{sui_energyefficient_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Energy-{{Efficient Resource Allocation}} with {{Flexible Frame Structure}} for {{Heterogeneous Services}}},\n  abstract = {The key objective of the fifth generation (5G) wireless technology is to support services with vastly variable requirements, which necessitates the flexible numerology and frame structure for radio resource allocation.

These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard. We also discuss the research challenges and perspectives.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun. Surv.

Proposed framework is a comprehensive solution which allows an anycast service has its unique domain-name (a.k.a FQDN), which is associated to multiple replicated servers' unicast addresses in the worldwide. With DNS query/reply service, and through Explicit Multicast (Xcast)-based replica probing, ranking, and selection procedures, clients finally reach the nearby server.

The message delivery between participated nodes and gateway in the WSNs affects the quality of service (QoS) such as energy consumption and the successful delivery rate (SDR). In this paper, we present a novel packet transmission model for a smart wireless paging sensor network (WPSN) based on LoRaWAN, which supports a real-time elderly care application. The model is used to investigate the performance of star topology communication on elderly care via Markov discrete-time M/M/1 queuing system. The proposed traffic model enables the performance evaluation of WPSN for elderly care. Moreover, an optimal cluster allocation policy is proposed by which maximizing SDR are obtained and QoS constraint requirements are met in terms of energy consumption. We conduct analytic analysis and simulation to exploit the QoS of LoRa based WSNs for elderly care application. The proposed WPSN is experimental studied and validated in a real elder care scenario.
