The development of D2D is driven by mobile operators to harvest short range communications for improving network performance and supporting proximity-based services. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental and interrelated aspects of D2D communication, security and privacy, which are essential for the adoption and deployment of D2D. We present an extensive review of the state-of-the-art solutions for enhancing security and privacy in D2D communication. By summarizing the challenges, requirements, and features of different proposals, we identify lessons to be learned from existing studies and derive a set of ``best practices.'' The primary goal of our work is to equip researchers and developers with a better understanding of the underlying problems and the potential solutions for D2D security and privacy. To inspire follow-up research, we identify open problems and highlight future directions with regard to system and communication design.

For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Network},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Netw.},\n  date = {2006-05},\n  pages = {41-47},\n  author = {Xu, Wenyuan and Ma, Ke and Trappe, W. and Zhang, Yanyong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/SYTFJXL4/Xu et al_2006_Jamming sensor networks.pdf},\n  note = {00565}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525872630,"version":0},"$loki":4},{"itemID":2968,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{lu_realtime_2016,\n  title = {Real-{{Time Wireless Sensor}}-{{Actuator Networks}} for {{Industrial Cyber}}-{{Physical Systems}}},\n  volume = {104},\n  issn = {0018-9219},\n  doi = {10.1109/JPROC.2015.2497161},\n  abstract = {With recent adoption of wireless sensor-actuator networks (WSANs) in industrial automation, industrial wireless control systems have emerged as a frontier of cyber-physical systems.

The advantage of the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the behaviors of traffic lights in terms of the conditions and events that cause phase alternations. Moreover, the size of the urban traffic network control system can be easily extended with our proposed modular technique.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Petri Nets}} 1989},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {1990},\n  pages = {1-29},\n  author = {Marsan, M.

Wireless communications have potential to support road safety by enabling road users to exchange information. In contrast to vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications for avoidance of inter-vehicle collisions, very limited efforts are made on communication mechanisms for pedestrian safety. This paper addresses the issue in a concrete way. We first formulate the requirement of the minimum information exchange distance for providing road users to have the necessary amount of time to perceive the situation and react. We then report our field tests and measurement based analysis to investigate if a Wi-Fi system can satisfy the application requirement. We also introduce a pedestrian protection application, V2ProVu, which provides the functionalities of the Wi-Fi communications, risk calculation, and hazard alarming. Our study discloses several useful insights including 1) information exchange for a velocity of 80 km/h has to be made before vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) distance is below 72 meters and 2) while this requirement is not too hard for radio communications technologies, the V2P communication range is greatly reduced if the signal is blocked by a human body.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium Proceedings}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2014-06},\n  pages = {1037-1042},\n  keywords = {VRU,Delay},\n  author = {Anaya, Jose Javier and Merdrignac, Pierre and Shagdar, Oyunchimeg and Nashashibi, Fawzi and Naranjo, Jose E.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/NC5EHJSX/Anaya et al_2014_Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protection of vulnerable road users.pdf},\n  note = {00080}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525873018,"version":0},"$loki":18},{"itemID":3183,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{bagheri_cellularbased_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Vienna, Austria}},\n  title = {Cellular-Based Vehicle to Pedestrian ({{V2P}}) Adaptive Communication for Collision Avoidance},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-6729-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7297588/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICCVE.2014.7297588},\n  abstract = {Road safety is one of the most important applications of vehicular networks. However, improving pedestrian safety via vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) wireless communication has not been extensively addressed. In this paper, our vision is to propose a method which enables development of V2P road safety applications via wireless communication and only utilizing the existing infrastructure and devices. As pedestrians' smartphones do not support the IEEE 802.11p amendment which is customized for vehicular networking, we have initiated an approach that utilizes cellular technologies. Study shows potential of utilizing 3G and LTE for highly mobile entities of vehicular network applications. In addition, some vehicles are already equipped with cellular connectivity but otherwise the driver's smartphone is used as an alternative. However, smartphone limited battery life is a bottleneck in realization of such pedestrian safety system. To tackle the energy limitation in smartphones, we employ an adaptive multi-level approach which operates in an energy-saving mode in risk-free situations but switches to normal mode as it detects a risky situation. Based on our evaluation and analysis, this adaptive approach considerably saves electrical energy and thus makes the cellular-based road-safety system practical.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{International Conference}} on {{Connected Vehicles}} and {{Expo}} ({{ICCVE}})},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{International Conference}} on {{Connected Vehicles}} and {{Expo}} ({{ICCVE}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2014-11},\n  pages = {450-456},\n  keywords = {VRU},\n  author = {Bagheri, Mehrdad and Siekkinen, Matti and Nurminen, Jukka K.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/884447MX/Bagheri et al_2014_Cellular-based vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) adaptive communication for collision.pdf},\n  note = {00030}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525873044,"version":0},"$loki":19},{"itemID":3184,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bagheri_cloudbased_23,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Cloud-{{Based Pedestrian Road}}-{{Safety}} with {{Situation}}-{{Adaptive Energy}}-{{Efficient Communication}}},\n  volume = {8},\n  issn = {1939-1390},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7518724/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MITS.2016.2573338},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Intell.

Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\\% of overall throughput, 15\\% of the time.

Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be significantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP. The central message in this paper is that wireless conditions in the vicinity of a roadside access point are predictable, and by exploiting this information, vehicular opportunistic access can be greatly improved.},\n  eventtitle = {The 5th International Conference},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on {{Mobile}} Systems, Applications and Services  - {{MobiSys}} '07},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2007},\n  pages = {206},\n  author = {Hadaller, David and Keshav, Srinivasan and Brecht, Tim and Agarwal, Shubham},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/WFJHZ6TI/Hadaller et al_2007_Vehicular opportunistic communication under the microscope.pdf},\n  note = {00274}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525873268,"version":0},"$loki":27},{"itemID":3199,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{briante_supporting_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Supporting Augmented Floating Car Data through Smartphone-Based Crowd-Sensing},\n  volume = {1},\n  issn = {22142096},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214209614000412},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.vehcom.2014.08.002},\n  abstract = {Over the last few years, academia, governmental agencies, automotive and electronic industries have increased their interest in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and services.

In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is explored to improve the segment identification accuracy of map-matching algorithms. The proposed ANN is continuously trained by using the horizontal shift imposed on GPS points and once it is trained, it will be used to correct raw GPS points before inputting them into the map-matching algorithm.

We have also defined an algorithm for accident prediction and alerting involving vehicles and pedestrians.

Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we fill this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system specifically devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios. Our experiments confirm what has been observed before in theory and simulation, i.e., the use of such a system can reduce, by as much as 40\\%, the amount of vehicles involved in highway pileups.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Traditional Kalman filter-based INS/GPS integration schemes have several inadequacies related to sensor error model and immunity to noise. Alternatively, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks with three layers have been implemented to improve the position accuracy of the integrated system. However, MLP neural networks show poor accuracy for low-cost INS because of the large inherent sensor errors. For the first time the paper demonstrates the use of knowledge-based source difference artificial neural network (SDANN) to improve navigation performance of low-cost sensor, with or without external aiding sources. Unlike the conventional MLP or artificial neural networks (ANN), the structure of SDANN consists of two MLP neural networks called the coarse model and the difference model. The coarse model learns the input\\textendash{}output data relationship whereas the difference model adds knowledge to the system and fine-tunes the coarse model output by learning the associated training or estimation error. Our proposed SDANN model illustrated a significant improvement in navigation accuracy of up to 81\\% over conventional MLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDANN method is effective for GPS/INS integration schemes using low-cost inertial sensors, with and without GPS.},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = {Measurement Science and Technology},\n  shortjournal = {Meas.

employed in civil missions are receiving remarkable attention from both research and industry. UAVs embed more and more sensor technology, and their small mounted cameras allow for efficient mapping of large areas in short time. Yet, civil missions such as rescue operations would need a timely delivery of high-resolution images, which calls for high-speed communication such as provided by WLAN IEEE 802.11n. Driven by extensive experiments, the key finding of this contribution is that 802.11n performs poorly in highly mobile and aerial scenarios, as the throughput between UAVs drops far below the theoretical maximum as soon as they become airborne. This is partially caused by the limitations of the embedded hardware, but also a result of the network dynamics of the aerial links. In order to dissect the origins of the low performance figures, we isolate the potential causes of degradation by analyzing our data of throughput, packet loss, aircraft and antenna orientation, and cruise speed. We discuss quantitatively how practical it is to deliver high-resolution images when being exposed to aerial throughput. We believe that it will be a long way until micro UAVs transferring large-size data become reality and argue for a new amendment of IEEE 802.11 addressing the communication among highly-mobile UAVs.},\n  eventtitle = {The 8th {{ACM}} International Workshop},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 8th {{ACM}} International Workshop on {{Wireless}} Network Testbeds, Experimental Evaluation \\& Characterization - {{WiNTECH}} '13},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2013},\n  pages = {25},\n  keywords = {drone,Delay},\n  author = {Asadpour, Mahdi and Giustiniano, Domenico and Hummel, Karin Anna},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/XPSRA3NT/Asadpour et al_2013_From ground to aerial communication.pdf},\n  note = {00024}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525873612,"version":0},"$loki":48},{"itemID":3260,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{fernandezllorca_autonomous_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Autonomous {{Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using}} a {{Fuzzy Steering Controller}}},\n  volume = {12},\n  issn = {1524-9050, 1558-0016},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5715879/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TITS.2010.2091272},\n  abstract = {Collision avoidance is one of the most difficult and challenging automatic driving operations in the domain of intelligent vehicles. In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers' behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to define the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed field tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Unfortunately, GPS data is still plagued with errors that frequently produce inaccurate trajectories. Research in map matching algorithms focuses on how to efficiently match GPS tracking data to the underlying road network. This article presents an innovative map matching algorithm that considers the trajectory of the data rather than merely the current position as in the typical map matching case. Instead of computing the precise angle which is traditionally used, a discrete eightdirection chain code, to represent a trend of movement, is used. Coupled with distance information, map matching decisions are made by comparing the differences between trajectories representing the road segments and GPS tracking data chain-codes. Moreover, to contrast the performance of the chain-code algorithm, two evaluation strategies, linear and non-linear, are analyzed. The presented chain-code map matching algorithm was evaluated for wheelchair navigation using university campus sidewalk data. The evaluation results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in terms of accuracy and computational time.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Transactions in GIS},\n  shortjournal = {Trans.

Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT.

Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network.

A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016-10-21},\n  author = {family=Heijden, given=Rens W., prefix=van der, useprefix=true and Dietzel, Stefan and Leinm\\\"uller, Tim and Kargl, Frank},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/W67H3GPW/van der Heijden et al_2016_Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation.pdf},\n  note = {00020}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525873784,"version":0},"$loki":56},{"itemID":3293,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{alvear_architecture_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An {{Architecture Offering Mobile Pollution Sensing}} with {{High Spatial Resolution}}},\n  volume = {2016},\n  issn = {1687-725X, 1687-7268},\n  url = {http://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2016/1458147/},\n  doi = {10.1155/2016/1458147},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Sensors},\n  shortjournal = {J.

Existing map-matching algorithms are compared and contrasted with respect to positioning sensors, map qualities, assumptions and accuracies. The results of these comparisons provide interesting insights into the workings of existing algorithms and the issues they must address for improving their performance. Example findings are: (a) not all map-matching algorithms pay sufficient attention to topology of networks, directionality of roads or turn-restrictions; (b) most map-matching algorithms make an unbalanced trade-off between performance and accuracy; and (c) weight-based map-matching algorithms balance simplicity and accuracy and advanced map-matching algorithms provide high accuracy but with low performance. Based on the findings, suggestions are made to improve existing algorithms.},\n  journaltitle = {Computers, Environment and Urban Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Comput. Environ.

This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  pages = {880-885},\n  author = {Alvear, Oscar and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan-Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/3Y6VC32N/Alvear et al_2015_Validation of a vehicle emulation platform supporting OBD-II communications.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525873864,"version":0},"$loki":60},{"itemID":3306,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{zhao_extended_2003,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {An {{Extended Kalman Filter Algorithm}} for {{Integrating GPS}} and {{Low Cost Dead Reckoning System Data}} for {{Vehicle Performance}} and {{Emissions Monitoring}}},\n  volume = {56},\n  issn = {03734633, 14697785},\n  url = {http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0373463303002212},\n  doi = {10.1017/S0373463303002212},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Navigation},\n  shortjournal = {J.

Four prediction models for the learning algorithms are applied and used with neural network solutions: back-propagation, Cascade-forward back-propagation, adaptive filter and extended Kalman filter, to estimate which model can be recommended. The noise simulation and bridge's short-period GPS of the monitoring displacement component of one Hz sampling frequency are used to validate the four models and the previous method. The results show that the Adaptive neural networks filter is suggested for de-noising the observations, specifically for the GPS displacement components of structures.

Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures.

In this paper, we propose an urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and hidden Markov models (HMM). Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac\\- curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth\\- ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip\\- tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework.

This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}} ({{IMIS}})},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-06},\n  pages = {450-455},\n  author = {Kim, Wooseong and Gerla, Mario},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/U28YNY9U/Kim_Gerla_2011_NAVOPT.pdf},\n  note = {00022}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525874284,"version":0},"$loki":84},{"itemID":3397,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{gerla_picsonwheels_2013,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{San Diego, CA}},\n  title = {Pics-on-Wheels: {{Photo}} Surveillance in the Vehicular Cloud},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-5288-8 978-1-4673-5287-1 978-1-4673-5286-4},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6504250/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504250},\n  shorttitle = {Pics-on-Wheels},\n  abstract = {Cloud computing allows user to access remote hardware, data and software through the network.

The feasibility of the Pics-on-Wheels service is demonstrated in a San Francisco scenario using published taxicab routes.},\n  eventtitle = {2013 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}} 2013)},\n  booktitle = {2013 {{International Conference}} on {{Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{ICNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2013-01},\n  pages = {1123-1127},\n  author = {Gerla, M. and {Jui-Ting Weng} and Pau, G.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/YAXKVPA9/Gerla et al_2013_Pics-on-wheels.pdf},\n  note = {00048}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525874304,"version":0},"$loki":85},{"itemID":3401,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{hancke_role_2012,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {The {{Role}} of {{Advanced Sensing}} in {{Smart Cities}}},\n  volume = {13},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/13/1/393},\n  doi = {10.3390/s130100393},\n  abstract = {In a world where resources are scarce and urban areas consume the vast majority of these resources, it is vital to make cities greener and more sustainable.

Ubiquitous sensing poses numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an overview of the state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical challenges associated with these technologies. In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies play a role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated with these applications are discussed.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-01-18},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {17-24},\n  author = {Jones, Tyler and Dali, Aniket and Rao, Manoj Ramesh and Biradar, Neha and Madassery, Jean and Liu, Kaikai},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/LPZF5AGW/Jones et al_2018_Towards a Layered and Secure Internet-of-Things Testbed via Hybrid Mesh.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525874428,"version":0},"$loki":92},{"itemID":3438,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{selimi_blockchainenabled_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Munich, Germany}},\n  title = {Towards {{Blockchain}}-Enabled {{Wireless Mesh Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-5838-5},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3211933.3211936},\n  doi = {10.1145/3211933.3211936},\n  eventtitle = {The 1st {{Workshop}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 1st {{Workshop}} on {{Cryptocurrencies}} and {{Blockchains}} for {{Distributed Systems}}  - {{CryBlock}}'18},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {13-18},\n  author = {Selimi, Mennan and Kabbinale, Aniruddh Rao and Ali, Anwaar and Navarro, Leandro and Sathiaseelan, Arjuna},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/ERIYLWB5/Selimi et al_2018_Towards Blockchain-enabled Wireless Mesh Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00009}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525874444,"version":0},"$loki":93},{"itemID":3441,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kabbinale_blockchain_2018,\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  eprint = {1811.04078},\n  primaryClass = {cs},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Blockchain for {{Economically Sustainable Wireless Mesh Networks}}},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04078},\n  abstract = {Decentralization, in the form mesh networking and blockchain, two promising technologies, is coming to the telecommunications industry.

Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals. The results show our LoRa mesh networking module achieved a 88.49\\% packet delivery ratio (PDR), while the LoRaWAN in starnetwork topology was only 58.7\\% under the same conditions.},\n  eventtitle = {The 16th {{ACM}}/{{IEEE International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 16th {{ACM}}/{{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Information Processing}} in {{Sensor Networks}}  - {{IPSN}} '17},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {259-260},\n  author = {Ke, Kai-Hsiang and Liang, Qi-Wen and Zeng, Guan-Jie and Lin, Jun-Han and Lee, Huang-Chen},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/MNV4WHIT/Ke et al_2017_A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-scale monitoring.pdf},\n  note = {00006}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525874550,"version":0},"$loki":99},{"itemID":3459,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{ochoa_evaluating_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Rome}},\n  title = {Evaluating {{LoRa}} Energy Efficiency for Adaptive Networks: {{From}} Star to Mesh Topologies},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-3839-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8115793/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115793},\n  shorttitle = {Evaluating {{LoRa}} Energy Efficiency for Adaptive Networks},\n  abstract = {The LoRa technology has emerged as an interesting solution for low power, long range IoT applications by proposing multiple ''degrees of freedom'' at the physical layer. This flexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2017-10},\n  pages = {1-8},\n  author = {Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Guizar, Arturo and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/IAAQ2PAE/Ochoa et al_2017_Evaluating LoRa energy efficiency for adaptive networks.pdf},\n  note = {00016}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525874582,"version":0},"$loki":100},{"itemID":3461,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{farooq_operating_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Operating {{Systems}} for {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  volume = {11},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/11/6/5900},\n  doi = {10.3390/s110605900},\n  shorttitle = {Operating {{Systems}} for {{Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2011-05-31},\n  pages = {5900-5930},\n  author = {Farooq, Muhammad Omer and Kunz, Thomas},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/6E6T6QJ5/Farooq_Kunz_2011_Operating Systems for Wireless Sensor Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00219}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525874594,"version":0},"$loki":101},{"itemID":3463,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{amjad_tinyosnew_2016,\n  title = {{{TinyOS}}-{{New Trends}}, {{Comparative Views}}, and {{Supported Sensing Applications}}: {{A Review}}},\n  volume = {16},\n  issn = {1530-437X, 1558-1748, 2379-9153},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7387670/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JSEN.2016.2519924},\n  shorttitle = {{{TinyOS}}-{{New Trends}}, {{Comparative Views}}, and {{Supported Sensing Applications}}},\n  number = {9},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Sensors Journal},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Sens.

This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources).

After a general introduction to the 802.15.4e standard, we describe the details of the main 802.15.4e MAC behavior modes, namely Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (DSME), and Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN). For each of them, we provide a detailed description and highlight the main features and possible application domains. Also, we survey the current literature and summarize open research issues.},\n  journaltitle = {Computer Communications},\n  shortjournal = {Comput.

Research has shown a substantial development of solutions for a wide range of devices and IoT platforms over the past 6-7 years. However, each solution provides its own IoT infrastructure, devices, APIs, and data formats leading to interoperability issues. Such interoperability issues are the consequence of many critical issues such as vendor lock-in, impossibility to develop IoT application exposing cross-platform, and/or cross-domain, difficulty in plugging non-interoperable IoT devices into different IoT platforms, and ultimately prevents the emergence of IoT technology at a large-scale. To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together.

In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  urldate = {2019-02-14},\n  date = {2017-03-01},\n  pages = {74-84},\n  author = {Aloi, G. and Caliciuri, G. and Fortino, G. and Gravina, R. and Pace, P. and Russo, W. and Savaglio, C.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/L6P8YIFR/Aloi et al_2017_Enabling IoT interoperability through opportunistic smartphone-based mobile.pdf},\n  note = {00106}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525874970,"version":0},"$loki":118},{"itemID":3603,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{wang_iot_2018,\n  title = {{{IoT Security Model}} and {{Performance Evaluation}}: {{A Blockchain Approach}}},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICNIDC.2018.8525716},\n  shorttitle = {{{IoT Security Model}} and {{Performance Evaluation}}},\n  abstract = {It is a research hotspot that using blockchain technology to solve the security problems of the Internet of Things (IoT).

The big data transmitted to the cloud or fog will consume massive network bandwidth. This may result in the IoT network easily encountering network congestion. Moreover, there are IoT applications that need to transfer multimedia data with multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements. A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed. The AQRA improves the average end-to-end flow performance by 10.75\\%, 11.88\\% and 10.82\\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. The AQRA improves the standard deviation of end-to-end flow performance by 14.37\\%, 17.95\\% and 14.28\\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively.

Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, thus moving the control logic from the node to a central controller. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature. Moreover, it delves into some of the challenges facing this paradigm, as well as the major SDWSN design requirements that need to be considered to address these challenges.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {1872-1899},\n  author = {Kobo, H.

As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would efficiently help to overcome the risk of congestion.

One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances.

It represents a key component of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart spaces. One of the most difficult challenges to support M2M communications is their huge number compared to available radio resources. Hence, to deal with random access channel (RACH) overload and to better control the access in LTE-A Networks, the 3GPP proposed the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor concept. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve this method based on adaptive multiple ACB factors, according to M2M traffic category with respect to their access delay budget and drop rate (QoS parameters). Simulations were done for testing the effectiveness of our MACB scheme and show that using multiples ACB factors and dynamically adjusting them to the congestion level in addition to traffic type category increases the access probability and reduces overload. The obtained results were then compared to the basic ACB method and show that the access probability increases especially for high priority traffic.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016-01},\n  pages = {693-698},\n  author = {Zangar, Nawel and Gharbi, Sami and Abdennebi, Marwen},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/QPWEPI5R/Zangar et al_2016_Service differentiation strategy based on MACB factor for M2M Communications in.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525875544,"version":0},"$loki":142},{"itemID":3738,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@incollection{bouzouita_random_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A Random Access Model for {{M2M}} Communications in {{LTE}}-Advanced Mobile Networks},\n  isbn = {978-0-12-800887-4},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780128008874000201},\n  booktitle = {Modeling and {{Simulation}} of {{Computer Networks}} and {{Systems}}},\n  publisher = Elsevier,\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2015},\n  pages = {577-599},\n  author = {Bouzouita, Meriam and Hadjadj-Aoul, Yassine and Zangar, Nawel and Tabbane, Sami and Viho, C\\'esar},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/YMDPKI2S/Bouzouita et al_2015_A random access model for M2M communications in LTE-advanced mobile networks.pdf},\n  doi = {10.1016/B978-0-12-800887-4.00020-1},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525875558,"version":0},"$loki":143},{"itemID":3739,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bouzouita_estimating_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Estimating the Number of Contending {{IoT}} Devices in {{5G}} Networks: {{Revealing}} the Invisible},\n  issn = {2161-3915},\n  url = {https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ett.3513},\n  doi = {10.1002/ett.3513},\n  shorttitle = {Estimating the Number of Contending {{IoT}} Devices in {{5G}} Networks},\n  journaltitle = {Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies},\n  shortjournal = {Trans.

The IoT vision is to extend the Internet into our everyday lives, so the number of connected devices and innovative applications are growing very fast to bring intelligence into\nas many domains as possible. The QoS for IoT application not only depends on the Internet network and communication\ninfrastructure, it is also impacted by the operation and performance of IoT sensing infrastructure. Therefore, the new QoS parameters such as data accuracy, sampling rate, and\ndevice availability become important for the IoT applications compared to the Internet applications. The huge number of the Internet-connected IoT devices and application, and the spontaneous traffic flow among them make the management of the quality of service complex\nacross the Internet infrastructure. On the other hand, the non-IP devices and their limited capabilities in terms of energy and transmission create the dynamic environment and hinder the direct interaction between devices and applications. The quality of service is becoming one of the critical non-functional IoT element which needs research and studies. A flexible and scalable QoS management mechanism must be implemented in IoT system to keep up with the growth rate of the Internet-connected IoT devices and applications as well as their heterogeneity and diversity. The solution should address the IoT application requirements and user satisfaction while considering the system dynamism, limitations, and characteristics. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networking which separates the control plane and the data plane of the network elements. It makes the network\nelements programmable via the centralized control plane. This approach enables more agile management and control over the network behavior. In this thesis, we take advantage of SDN technology as the future of the Internet to offer a\nflexible and adaptive QoS support scheme for the IoT services. We present an SDN-based middleware to define a QoS management framework to manage the application specific QoS\nneeds across the IoT infrastructure including transport and sensing network. Also, we propose a new QoS model that takes into account the application QoS preferences and the network\nelements status to allocate effectively the resources for the applications across SDN network while maximizing network performance.},\n  institution = {{\\'Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\\'eal}},\n  type = {masters},\n  urldate = {2019-04-11},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  author = {Meshinchi, Atefeh},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/BNHZ9XGG/Meshinchi_2018_QOS-Aware and Status-Aware Adaptive Resource Allocation Framework in SDN-Based.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/F4MX94LC/3096.html},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525875840,"version":0},"$loki":167},{"itemID":3803,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@phdthesis{drissi_multi_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Multi Criteria Real Time Network Selection Framework}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Environment}} for {{5G}} Systems: {{Application}} for {{Mobile}} and {{Vehicular Heterogeneous Networks}}},\n  url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01872986/document},\n  shorttitle = {A {{Multi Criteria Real Time Network Selection Framework}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Environment}} for {{5G}} Systems},\n  abstract = {Network selection receives considerable attention from communication networks researchers. This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the offered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of e\u000eciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for different multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of different parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study. In the first part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user's preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario. We also improve the latter solution by proposing a network selection algorithm that provides a load balancing technique based on matching game theory to overcome network overload conditions in high-speed scenarios. In the second part, the performance study has been evaluated for two scenario types: Cellular and Vehicular. The proposed algorithms were evaluated and validated in both mobile and vehicular environments using the NS3 simulator.},\n  institution = {{Universit\\'e Mohammed V - Rabat}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2017-10-21},\n  keywords = {game},\n  author = {Drissi, M.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/ZI97W7CU/Drissi_2017_A Multi Criteria Real Time Network Selection Framework in Heterogeneous.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/4KD8ZQNP/tel-01872986.html},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525875880,"version":0},"$loki":168},{"itemID":3806,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bari_automated_2007,\n  title = {Automated Network Selection in a Heterogeneous Wireless Network Environment},\n  volume = {21},\n  issn = {0890-8044},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4107918/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MNET.2007.314536},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Network},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Netw.},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2007-01},\n  pages = {34-40},\n  author = {Bari, Farooq and Leung, Victor},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/SM8ZITCD/Bari_Leung_2007_Automated network selection in a heterogeneous wireless network environment.pdf},\n  note = {00282}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525875896,"version":0},"$loki":169},{"itemID":3808,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{qingyangsong_network_2005,\n  location = {{Seoul, Korea}},\n  title = {A Network Selection Mechanism for next Generation Networks},\n  volume = {2},\n  isbn = {978-0-7803-8938-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1494578/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICC.2005.1494578},\n  eventtitle = {{{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}}, 2005. {{ICC}} 2005. 2005},\n  booktitle = {{{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}}, 2005. {{ICC}} 2005. 2005},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2005},\n  pages = {1418-1422},\n  author = {{Qingyang Song} and Jamalipour, A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/I5RKEB5Z/Qingyang Song_Jamalipour_2005_A network selection mechanism for next generation networks.pdf},\n  note = {00352}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525875912,"version":0},"$loki":170},{"itemID":3810,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{niyato_dynamics_2009,\n  title = {Dynamics of {{Network Selection}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Networks}}: {{An Evolutionary Game Approach}}},\n  volume = {58},\n  issn = {0018-9545, 1939-9359},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4607241/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TVT.2008.2004588},\n  shorttitle = {Dynamics of {{Network Selection}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Networks}}},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

In comparison with other RAT selection techniques, including network-centric, hybrid and user-centric methods, simulation results prove the efficiency of our hybrid approach in enhancing resource utilization and maximizing user satisfaction.},\n  eventtitle = {2013 {{IEEE}} 9th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2013 {{IEEE}} 9th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-14},\n  date = {2013-10},\n  pages = {521-528},\n  author = {Helou, Melhem El and Ibrahim, Marc and Lahoud, Samer and Khawam, Kinda},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/HG9H96IA/Helou et al. - 2013 - Radio access selection approaches in heterogeneous.pdf},\n  note = {00013}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525875976,"version":0},"$loki":174},{"itemID":3819,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{wenhuizhang_handover_2004,\n  location = {{Atlanta, GA, USA}},\n  title = {Handover Decision Using Fuzzy {{MADM}} in Heterogeneous Networks},\n  isbn = {978-0-7803-8344-9},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1311263/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WCNC.2004.1311263},\n  eventtitle = {2004 {{IEEE Wireless Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {2004 {{IEEE Wireless Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{IEEE Cat}}. {{No}}.{{04TH8733}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-14},\n  date = {2004},\n  pages = {653-658},\n  author = {{Wenhui Zhang}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/LN3E74FF/Wenhui Zhang - 2004 - Handover decision using fuzzy MADM in heterogeneou.pdf},\n  note = {00487}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525875990,"version":0},"$loki":175},{"itemID":3826,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{dhar_network_2007,\n  location = {{Allahabad, India}},\n  title = {Network {{Selection}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Environment}}: {{A Ranking Algorithm}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4244-1877-0 978-1-4244-1878-7},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4475744/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WCSN.2007.4475744},\n  shorttitle = {Network {{Selection}} in {{Heterogeneous Wireless Environment}}},\n  eventtitle = {2007 {{Third International Conference}} on {{Wireless Communication}} and {{Sensor Networks}}},\n  booktitle = {2007 {{Third International Conference}} on {{Wireless Communication}} and {{Sensor Networks}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-14},\n  date = {2007-12},\n  pages = {41-44},\n  author = {Dhar, Joydip and Ravi, Kiran S and Yashwanth, Reddy K},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/BYYWAFB4/Dhar et al_2007_Network Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Environment.pdf},\n  note = {00019}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525876018,"version":0},"$loki":176},{"itemID":3831,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{zitouni_software_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Software {{Defined Radio Prototyping}} of {{5G Radio Access Technology}} for {{VANET}}},\n  abstract = {Channel capacity and radio resources management are critical issues for IEEE 802.11p VANET networks. Existing solutions are mainly focused on channel access, routing and PHYsical (PHY) layer separately, even if they are proved efficient through simulations, they are far to consider real-world conditions. In this deliverable, we propose a candidate 5G Radio Access Technology (RAT) for VANET based on Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) of a transmitter, and Signal Interference Cancellation (SIC) applied at a receiver. We prove that this solution allows to more than two users to share the same frequency at the same time.

We consider software featuring of both: packet structure and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) encoding.

Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modified. Finally, it enables a seamless switch between simulations and experiments and, thus, helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Comparing the transceiver's performance with independent results from simulations and experiments, we underline its potential to be used as a tool for further studies of IEEE 802.11p networks both in field operational tests as well as for simulation-based development of novel physical layer solutions.

Consequently, a considerable number of applications never seen before is emerging to make daily lifestyle more practical and connected through sharing, storing and processing personal data. When applied to industry, the same technologies can cause a real revolution in the manner how the information is treated. The value of the processed data is increasing fast and point to the fourth industrial revolution, or industry 4.0. This paper evaluates the performance of two ICT (Information and Communication Technology) protocols coming from the consumer world with an enormous potential to be used by industry. Experiments were performed to measure the round trip time using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and WebSocket protocols with the exchange of data between one server in Italy and another in Brazil. The results can be analyzed for each possible application and different network paths. The average latency samples using each of the protocols were similar, defining the payload size of the requests, but changing according to the way.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE Symposium}} on {{Computers}} and {{Communications}} ({{ISCC}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE Symposium}} on {{Computers}} and {{Communications}} ({{ISCC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-15},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {01233-01238},\n  author = {Silva, Diego R.

The main reason is due to the existence of white spots. The lack of communication between breeders does not allow the dissemination of vital information such as water points location, bush fires geographic location, epidemic area, and available pastureland. However, in undeserved areas, satellite communications are very expensive for rural population. Therefore, we propose a lowcost communication based on LoRa transmission that enables different services like short message text, voice messages, status of a water points, geographic location. The deployed architecture is a delay tolerant ad-hoc network that can cover a large area with a mesh system.},\n  eventtitle = {2019 22nd {{Conference}} on {{Innovation}} in {{Clouds}}, {{Internet}} and {{Networks}} and {{Workshops}} ({{ICIN}})},\n  booktitle = {2019 22nd {{Conference}} on {{Innovation}} in {{Clouds}}, {{Internet}} and {{Networks}} and {{Workshops}} ({{ICIN}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-16},\n  date = {2019-02},\n  pages = {236-238},\n  author = {Seye, Madoune R. and Diallo, Moussa and Gueye, Bamba and Cambier, Christophe},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/Z2A4LDBK/Seye et al. -

In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users' complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufficient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great influences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper first defines the SFSD and describes the important influences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  urldate = {2019-04-27},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {39895-39906},\n  author = {Min, Xunyou and Xu, Xiaofei and Liu, Zhizhong and Chu, Dianhui and Wang, Zhongjie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/I8KMID9I/Min et al. - 2018 - An Approach to Resource and QoS-Aware Services Opt.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1556525876542,"version":0},"$loki":215}],"idIndex":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215],"binaryIndices":{"itemID":{"name":"itemID","dirty":true,"values":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213]},"exportNotes":{"name":"exportNotes","dirty":true,"values":[]},"useJournalAbbreviation":{"name":"useJournalAbbreviation","dirty":true,"values":[]},"DOIandURL":{"name":"DOIandURL","dirty":false,"values":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214]},"asciiBibLaTeX":{"name":"asciiBibLaTeX","dirty":true,"values":[]},"asciiBibTeX":{"name":"asciiBibTeX","dirty":true,"values":[]},"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":{"name":"biblatexExtendedNameFormat","dirty":true,"values":[]},"bibtexParticleNoOp":{"name":"bibtexParticleNoOp","dirty":true,"values":[]},"bibtexURL":{"name":"bibtexURL","dirty":true,"values":[]}},"constraints":null,"uniqueNames":[],"transforms":{"Better BibTeX metadata":[{"type":"Better BibTeX metadata","value":{"BetterBibTeX":"5.1.75"}}]},"objType":"Better BibLaTeX","dirty":false,"cachedIndex":null,"cachedBinaryIndex":null,"cachedData":null,"adaptiveBinaryIndices":false,"transactional":false,"cloneObjects":true,"cloneMethod":"parse-stringify","asyncListeners":false,"disableMeta":false,"disableChangesApi":true,"disableDeltaChangesApi":true,"autoupdate":false,"serializableIndices":true,"ttl":null,"maxId":215,"DynamicViews":[],"events":{"insert":[],"update":[],"pre-insert":[],"pre-update":[],"close":[],"flushbuffer":[],"error":[],"delete":[null],"warning":[null]},"changes":[]}
