This is irrespective of the constraints of the operational environment, thus alleviating outage and accuracy problems associated with the use of stand-alone location sensors.

Advanced systems to improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart cities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later use, to intelligent control systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously, the possible improvements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous sensing poses numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an overview of the state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical challenges associated with these technologies. In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies play a role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated with these applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies belong to different disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts to bridge these to provide a broad overview, which can be of help to researchers and developers in understanding how advanced sensing can play a role in smart cities.},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2012-12-27},\n  pages = {393-425},\n  author = {Hancke, Gerhard and Silva, Bruno and Hancke, Jr., Gerhard},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/3XSTERPC/Hancke et al_2012_The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf},\n  note = {00318}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902589808,"version":0,"updated":1559047884660},"$loki":340},{"itemID":3704,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bera_softwaredefined_2017,\n  title = {Software-{{Defined Networking}} for {{Internet}} of {{Things}}: {{A Survey}}},\n  volume = {4},\n  issn = {2327-4662},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8017556/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JIOT.2017.2746186},\n  shorttitle = {Software-{{Defined Networking}} for {{Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Internet of Things Journal},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Internet Things J.},\n  urldate = {2019-03-22},\n  date = {2017-12},\n  pages = {1994-2008},\n  author = {Bera, Samaresh and Misra, Sudip and Vasilakos, Athanasios V.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/FLAE22VT/Bera et al_2017_Software-Defined Networking for Internet of Things.pdf},\n  note = {00057}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902589842,"version":0,"updated":1559047884772},"$loki":341},{"itemID":3884,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{pham_lowcost_f,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Low-Cost {{LoRa IoT}} Device: A Step-by-Step Tutorial},\n  pages = {45},\n  author = {Pham, Congduc},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/B8YCD9VI/Pham -

First, we present a NS-3 module that simulates the behavior of LoRa in an accurate way. To validate the module, we compare its results with measurements on a real-world testbed and with measured values reported by other work. We also show that the module correctly represents the capture effect that lowers the packet drop rate due to collisions. Second, we want to improve the performance of LoRa devices while not impacting energy consumption, the aspect that usually is not taken into account in the literature. We use the simulator to evaluate CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), a simple enhancement to LoRaWAN that lowers the collision ratio. The simulation results show that CSMA considerably lowers the collision ratio while only slightly increasing energy consumption. We also observe that CSMA presents lower energy consumption than LoRa for a large number of devices. Another advantage of CSMA consists of increased throughput and larger network capacity because the ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle do not longer apply.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}} 2018)},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-13},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  pages = {1-7},\n  author = {To, Thanh-Hai and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/SSLB3I38/To and Duda - 2018 - Simulation of LoRa in NS-3 Improving LoRa Perform.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902590186,"version":0,"updated":1559047885028},"$loki":346},{"itemID":3348,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lopes_traffic_2010,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Funchal, Madeira Island, Portugal}},\n  title = {Traffic and Mobility Data Collection for Real-Time Applications},\n  isbn = {978-1-4244-7657-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5625282/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625282},\n  abstract = {Successful development of effective real-time traffic management and information systems requires high quality traffic information in real-time.

Next, we detail some techniques for data preprocessing and integration, or fusion, phases. Even though the comprehensive use of historical traffic data and assignment models to support the most part of online services and operations, real-time data is extremely important to promote models' accuracy and, therefore, the reliability of information and outputs derived from data fusion and processing. Together with techniques and theoretical formulas we present a case study applied to the Portuguese Brisa's A5 motorway, a 25 km inter-urban highway between Lisbon and Cascais. Traffic on this motorway heading to Lisbon in the morning rush hours typically experiences high levels of congestion. Brisa, the motorway operator company, has equipped A5 with a variety of traffic sensors to be used in a real-time multi-purpose way, either for traffic management and control or for traveler information and third-part applications.},\n  eventtitle = {2010 13th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}} - ({{ITSC}} 2010)},\n  booktitle = {13th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2010-09},\n  pages = {216-223},\n  author = {Lopes, J. and Bento, J. and Huang, E. and Antoniou, C. and Ben-Akiva, M.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/FWP7R8TC/Lopes et al_2010_Traffic and mobility data collection for real-time applications.pdf},\n  note = {00021}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902590452,"version":0,"updated":1559047884634},"$loki":347},{"itemID":4120,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{even-dar_action_2006,\n  title = {Action {{Elimination}} and {{Stopping Conditions}} for the {{Multi}}-{{Armed Bandit}} and {{Reinforcement Learning Problems}}},\n  volume = {7},\n  abstract = {We incorporate statistical confidence intervals in both the multi-armed bandit and the reinforcement learning problems.

This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the confidence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability).

Traditional Kalman filter-based INS/GPS integration schemes have several inadequacies related to sensor error model and immunity to noise. Alternatively, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks with three layers have been implemented to improve the position accuracy of the integrated system. However, MLP neural networks show poor accuracy for low-cost INS because of the large inherent sensor errors. For the first time the paper demonstrates the use of knowledge-based source difference artificial neural network (SDANN) to improve navigation performance of low-cost sensor, with or without external aiding sources. Unlike the conventional MLP or artificial neural networks (ANN), the structure of SDANN consists of two MLP neural networks called the coarse model and the difference model. The coarse model learns the input\\textendash{}output data relationship whereas the difference model adds knowledge to the system and fine-tunes the coarse model output by learning the associated training or estimation error. Our proposed SDANN model illustrated a significant improvement in navigation accuracy of up to 81\\% over conventional MLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDANN method is effective for GPS/INS integration schemes using low-cost inertial sensors, with and without GPS.},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = {Measurement Science and Technology},\n  shortjournal = {Meas.

For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices.

Worse, a transmit queue that is blocked by a missing ACK will delay messages for all protocols running on the same node that use the same access category. Other than in traditional networks, missing ACKs are especially prevalent in VANETs due to their high topology dynamics.

Wireless communications have potential to support road safety by enabling road users to exchange information. In contrast to vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications for avoidance of inter-vehicle collisions, very limited efforts are made on communication mechanisms for pedestrian safety. This paper addresses the issue in a concrete way. We first formulate the requirement of the minimum information exchange distance for providing road users to have the necessary amount of time to perceive the situation and react. We then report our field tests and measurement based analysis to investigate if a Wi-Fi system can satisfy the application requirement. We also introduce a pedestrian protection application, V2ProVu, which provides the functionalities of the Wi-Fi communications, risk calculation, and hazard alarming. Our study discloses several useful insights including 1) information exchange for a velocity of 80 km/h has to be made before vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) distance is below 72 meters and 2) while this requirement is not too hard for radio communications technologies, the V2P communication range is greatly reduced if the signal is blocked by a human body.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium Proceedings}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2014-06},\n  pages = {1037-1042},\n  keywords = {VRU,Delay},\n  author = {Anaya, Jose Javier and Merdrignac, Pierre and Shagdar, Oyunchimeg and Nashashibi, Fawzi and Naranjo, Jose E.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/NC5EHJSX/Anaya et al_2014_Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protection of vulnerable road users.pdf},\n  note = {00080}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902592398,"version":0,"updated":1559047884506},"$loki":371},{"itemID":3403,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{lee_vehicular_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Vehicular Cloud Networking: Architecture and Design Principles},\n  volume = {52},\n  issn = {0163-6804},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6736756/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MCOM.2014.6736756},\n  shorttitle = {Vehicular Cloud Networking},\n  abstract = {Over the past several decades, VANET has been a core networking technology to provide safety and comfort to drivers in vehicular environments.

One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the traffic congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa.

Different standards are being proposed to meet these novel requirements. In this paper, the technical differences between a wideband spread spectrum (LoRa-like) and an ultra narrowband (Sigfox-like) network will be explained and evaluated. On the physical layer, simulation results show that an ultra narrowband network has a larger coverage, while wideband spread spectrum networks are less sensitive to interference. When considering the contention between nodes and interference between different networks, simulations show that adaptation of frequency and modulation is imperative for efficiently dealing with varying contention and interference in long range unlicensed networks. Depending on network load, size and distance, a device in a wideband network can send 6 times more packets to the base station when there is active rate and frequency management and an intra-technology control plane.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 23rd {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 23rd {{International Conference}} on {{Telecommunications}} ({{ICT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2016-05},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  keywords = {PDR,Throughput,SIR},\n  author = {Reynders, Brecht and Meert, Wannes and Pollin, Sofie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/8AZTK3KP/Reynders et al. - 2016 - Range and coexistence analysis of long range unlic.pdf},\n  note = {00082}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902593050,"version":0,"updated":1559047885012},"$loki":381},{"itemID":4200,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{springer_spread_2000,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Munich, Germany}},\n  title = {Spread Spectrum Communications Using Chirp Signals},\n  isbn = {978-0-7803-6323-6},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/874794/},\n  doi = {10.1109/EURCOM.2000.874794},\n  eventtitle = {On {{Information Systems}} for {{Enhanced Public Safety}} and {{Security}} ({{EUR}}-{{Comm}} 2000)},\n  booktitle = {{{IEEE}}/{{AFCEA EUROCOMM}} 2000. {{Information Systems}} for {{Enhanced Public Safety}} and {{Security}} ({{Cat}}. {{No}}.{{00EX405}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2000},\n  pages = {166-170},\n  author = {Springer, A. and Gugler, W. and Huemer, M. and Reindl, L. and Ruppel, C.C.W. and Weigel, R.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/RKNIX8D8/Springer et al. - 2000 - Spread spectrum communications using chirp signals.pdf},\n  note = {00127}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902593072,"version":0,"updated":1559047885014},"$loki":382},{"itemID":3633,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{chowdhury_survey_2018,\n  title = {A Survey Study on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} Resource Management},\n  volume = {120},\n  issn = {1084-8045},\n  url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804518302315},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.jnca.2018.07.007},\n  abstract = {In the modern era of computation, Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted more and more attention for implementing automation based high quality eco-system, innovative and reliable services, and improved productivity. That is why, IoT is presently spanning over a diverse range of applications in the fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, military, industry, etc. The resources IoT requires in those applications are heterogeneous in nature, for example, storage, processor, network, sensor nodes, energy, etc. The obvious challenge is how to manage these limited resources efficiently. Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed. The paper considers with such a future direction of research in this field.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  urldate = {2019-03-07},\n  date = {2018-10-15},\n  pages = {42-60},\n  author = {Chowdhury, Abishi and Raut, Shital A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/8678UQHT/Chowdhury_Raut_2018_A survey study on Internet of Things resource management.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902593440,"version":0,"updated":1559047884738},"$loki":383},{"itemID":3850,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{seye_cowshed_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Paris, France}},\n  title = {{{COWShED}}: {{Communication Within White Spots}} for {{Breeders}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-8336-1},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8685838/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICIN.2019.8685838},\n  shorttitle = {{{COWShED}}},\n  abstract = {Livestock transhumance in Senegal is done in several areas and more specifically in Sylvo-pastoral areas located in the Ferlo's region where it is difficult or impossible to communicate with terrestrial communication systems.

Besides separating the business logic from the implementation, the state machine has a dynamic structure which is verifiable and adaptable. As a result, we can easily modify the process flow or change the management rules at run-time, and reflect their effects on the running process instances.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016-10-21},\n  author = {family=Heijden, given=Rens W., prefix=van der, useprefix=true and Dietzel, Stefan and Leinm\\\"uller, Tim and Kargl, Frank},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/W67H3GPW/van der Heijden et al_2016_Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation.pdf},\n  note = {00020}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902594076,"version":0,"updated":1559047884602},"$loki":392},{"itemID":3648,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{hu_survey_24,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Survey}} on {{Software}}-{{Defined Network}} and {{OpenFlow}}: {{From Concept}} to {{Implementation}}},\n  volume = {16},\n  issn = {1553-877X},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6819788},\n  doi = {10.1109/COMST.2014.2326417},\n  shorttitle = {A {{Survey}} on {{Software}}-{{Defined Network}} and {{OpenFlow}}},\n  abstract = {Software-defined network (SDN) has become one of the most important architectures for the management of largescale complex networks, which may require repolicing or reconfigurations from time to time.

Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we fill this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system specifically devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios.

Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals. The results show our LoRa mesh networking module achieved a 88.49\\% packet delivery ratio (PDR), while the LoRaWAN in starnetwork topology was only 58.7\\% under the same conditions.},\n  eventtitle = {The 16th {{ACM}}/{{IEEE International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 16th {{ACM}}/{{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Information Processing}} in {{Sensor Networks}}  - {{IPSN}} '17},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {259-260},\n  author = {Ke, Kai-Hsiang and Liang, Qi-Wen and Zeng, Guan-Jie and Lin, Jun-Han and Lee, Huang-Chen},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/MNV4WHIT/Ke et al_2017_A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-scale monitoring.pdf},\n  note = {00006}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902594424,"version":0,"updated":1559047884688},"$loki":396},{"itemID":3659,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{beyene_evaluation_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Evaluation of {{SDN}} in {{Small Wireless}}-Capable and {{Resource}}-Constrained {{Devices}}},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {137},\n  author = {Beyene, Million Aregawi},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/AKBEWXAX/Beyene_Evaluation of SDN in Small Wireless-capable and Resource-constrained Devices.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902594434,"version":0,"updated":1559047884748},"$loki":397},{"itemID":4440,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{korbi_lorawan_2018,\n  location = {{Cambridge, MA}},\n  title = {{{LoRaWAN Analysis Under Unsaturated Traffic}}, {{Orthogonal}} and {{Non}}-{{Orthogonal Spreading Factor Conditions}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-7659-2},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8548056/},\n  doi = {10.1109/NCA.2018.8548056},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Symposium}} on {{Network Computing}} and {{Applications}} ({{NCA}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Symposium}} on {{Network Computing}} and {{Applications}} ({{NCA}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-18},\n  date = {2018-11},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  author = {Korbi, Ines EI and Ghamri-Doudane, Yacine and Saidane, Leila Azouz},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/7UHYKYFY/Korbi et al_2018_LoRaWAN Analysis Under Unsaturated Traffic, Orthogonal and Non-Orthogonal.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902594456,"version":0,"updated":1559047885184},"$loki":398},{"itemID":3189,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{liebner_active_2013,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Gold Coast City, Australia}},\n  title = {Active Safety for Vulnerable Road Users Based on Smartphone Position Data},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-2755-8 978-1-4673-2754-1},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6629479/},\n  doi = {10.1109/IVS.2013.6629479},\n  abstract = {Smartphones have long become an omnipresent part of our life.

The corpus of geotagged posts from OSNs includes people's feedbacks about a wide range of topics, with precise temporal and geographical metadata, that can be used as a support or an improvement to hardware sensors. For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area. Such a correlation can be exploited to integrate and extend existing air pollution monitoring networks. At the end of the manuscript we propose to further employ the time series of posts returned by the geosocial search to predict next pollution values.},\n  journaltitle = {Pervasive and Mobile Computing},\n  shortjournal = {Pervasive Mob.

Our improvements to the choreography algorithm include (i) the linking of the initial state of the ASM to the precondition of the goal, (ii) the introduction of the concept of a final state in the execution of the ASM and its linking to the postcondition of the goal, and (iii) modification to the execution of the ASM so that it stops when the final state condition is satisfied by the current configuration of the machine. Our choreography engine takes as input semantic web service specifications written in the Flora-2 dialect of F-logic. Furthermore, we prove the equivalence of ASMs (evolving algebras) and evolving ontologies in the sense that one can simulate the other, a first in literature.

One of the key issues enabling future solutions is achieving an effective integration between mobile apps and vehicles. Such integration can be efficiently achieved on all existing vehicles by relying on the On Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) interface. This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2015 12th {{Annual IEEE Consumer Communications}} and {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-01},\n  pages = {880-885},\n  author = {Alvear, Oscar and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan-Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/3Y6VC32N/Alvear et al_2015_Validation of a vehicle emulation platform supporting OBD-II communications.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902595360,"version":0,"updated":1559047884612},"$loki":408},{"itemID":3368,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{williams_modeling_2003,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Modeling and {{Forecasting Vehicular Traffic Flow}} as a {{Seasonal ARIMA Process}}: {{Theoretical Basis}} and {{Empirical Results}}},\n  volume = {129},\n  issn = {0733-947X, 1943-5436},\n  url = {http://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-947X%282003%29129%3A6%28664%29},\n  doi = {10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:6(664)},\n  shorttitle = {Modeling and {{Forecasting Vehicular Traffic Flow}} as a {{Seasonal ARIMA Process}}},\n  abstract = {This article presents the theoretical basis for modeling univariate traffic condition data streams as seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average processes.

networks. This aggravates the already over-congested unlicensed radio bands, calling for new mechanisms to improve spectrum management and energy efficiency, such as transmission power control. Existing protocols are based on simplistic heuristics that often approach interference problems (i.e., packet loss, delay and energy waste) by increasing power, leading to detrimental results. The scope of this work is to investigate how machine learning may be used to bring wireless nodes to the lowest possible transmission power level and, in turn, to respect the quality requirements of the overall network. Lowering transmission power has benefits in terms of both energy consumption and interference. We propose a protocol of transmission power control through a reinforcement learning process that we have set in a multi-agent system. The agents are independent learners using the same exploration strategy and reward structure, leading to an overall cooperative network. The simulation results show that the system converges to an equilibrium where each node transmits at the minimum power while respecting high packet reception ratio constraints. Consequently, the system benefits from low energy consumption and packet delay.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2018-01-27},\n  pages = {375},\n  author = {Chincoli, Michele and Liotta, Antonio},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/G6JTECZ2/Chincoli and Liotta - 2018 - Self-Learning Power Control in Wireless Sensor Net.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/XQAU2DE4/chincoli2018.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902595848,"version":0,"updated":1559047884998},"$loki":414},{"itemID":3185,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{david_car2x_2010,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{CAR}}-2-{{X}} and {{Pedestrian Safety}}},\n  volume = {5},\n  issn = {1556-6072},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5430547/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MVT.2009.935536},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Veh.

Consequently, a considerable number of applications never seen before is emerging to make daily lifestyle more practical and connected through sharing, storing and processing personal data. When applied to industry, the same technologies can cause a real revolution in the manner how the information is treated. The value of the processed data is increasing fast and point to the fourth industrial revolution, or industry 4.0. This paper evaluates the performance of two ICT (Information and Communication Technology) protocols coming from the consumer world with an enormous potential to be used by industry. Experiments were performed to measure the round trip time using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and WebSocket protocols with the exchange of data between one server in Italy and another in Brazil. The results can be analyzed for each possible application and different network paths. The average latency samples using each of the protocols were similar, defining the payload size of the requests, but changing according to the way.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE Symposium}} on {{Computers}} and {{Communications}} ({{ISCC}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE Symposium}} on {{Computers}} and {{Communications}} ({{ISCC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-15},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {01233-01238},\n  author = {Silva, Diego R.

The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

In order to alleviate the problem, we can use sensing capabilities of mobile smartphones to detect, warn and safeguard VRUs. In this research we have proposed an infrastructure-less fog-based architecture where fog nodes process delay sensitive data obtained from smartphones for alerting pedestrians and drivers before sending the data to the cloud for further analysis. Fog computing is used in order to develop the architecture since it is an emerging paradigm that has paramount of advantages for low-latency applications which demand mobility support, geodistribution and location awareness. We have also defined an algorithm for accident prediction and alerting involving vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture is able to render alerts in real time whichever wireless communication (Wi-Fi or LTE) is used to connect smartphones with fog nodes.

This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance. Last, the application parameters required by the smart energy scenario influence LoRa performance, but their impacts have been scarcely reported. Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that considers performance issues when establishing a LoRa network on a real-world application testbed.},\n  number = {7},\n  journaltitle = Sustainability,\n  urldate = {2019-04-29},\n  date = {2019-03-30},\n  pages = {1917},\n  author = {Kim, Dong-Hoon and Lee, Eun-Kyu and Kim, Jibum},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/6Z6NW5T7/Kim et al_2019_Experiencing LoRa Network Establishment on a Smart Energy Campus Testbed.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902597962,"version":0,"updated":1559047884904},"$loki":441},{"itemID":4438,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{cuomo_trafficoriented_2018,\n  location = {{Capri}},\n  title = {Towards Traffic-Oriented Spreading Factor Allocations in {{LoRaWAN}} Systems},\n  isbn = {978-3-903176-05-8},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8407091/},\n  doi = {10.23919/MedHocNet.2018.8407091},\n  eventtitle = {2018 17th {{Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop}} ({{Med}}-{{Hoc}}-{{Net}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 17th {{Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop}} ({{Med}}-{{Hoc}}-{{Net}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-18},\n  date = {2018-06},\n  pages = {1-8},\n  author = {Cuomo, Francesca and Gamez, Julio Cesar Carrasquel and Maurizio, Antonio and Scipione, Laura and Campo, Manuel and Caponi, Alberto and Bianchi, Giuseppe and Rossini, Giampaolo and Pisani, Patrizio},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/9JLIVWCZ/Cuomo et al_2018_Towards traffic-oriented spreading factor allocations in LoRaWAN systems.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902597998,"version":0,"updated":1559047885182},"$loki":442},{"itemID":3171,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@incollection{marsan_stochastic_1990,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Berlin, Heidelberg}},\n  title = {Stochastic {{Petri}} Nets: {{An}} Elementary Introduction},\n  volume = {424},\n  isbn = {978-3-540-52494-6 978-3-540-46998-8},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/3-540-52494-0_23},\n  shorttitle = {Stochastic {{Petri}} Nets},\n  abstract = {An important characteristic of models concerns the representation of the system behaviour along the time scale. While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Petri Nets}} 1989},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {1990},\n  pages = {1-29},\n  author = {Marsan, M.

However, improving pedestrian safety via vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) wireless communication has not been extensively addressed. In this paper, our vision is to propose a method which enables development of V2P road safety applications via wireless communication and only utilizing the existing infrastructure and devices. As pedestrians' smartphones do not support the IEEE 802.11p amendment which is customized for vehicular networking, we have initiated an approach that utilizes cellular technologies. Study shows potential of utilizing 3G and LTE for highly mobile entities of vehicular network applications. In addition, some vehicles are already equipped with cellular connectivity but otherwise the driver's smartphone is used as an alternative. However, smartphone limited battery life is a bottleneck in realization of such pedestrian safety system. To tackle the energy limitation in smartphones, we employ an adaptive multi-level approach which operates in an energy-saving mode in risk-free situations but switches to normal mode as it detects a risky situation. Based on our evaluation and analysis, this adaptive approach considerably saves electrical energy and thus makes the cellular-based road-safety system practical.},\n  eventtitle = {2014 {{International Conference}} on {{Connected Vehicles}} and {{Expo}} ({{ICCVE}})},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{International Conference}} on {{Connected Vehicles}} and {{Expo}} ({{ICCVE}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2014-11},\n  pages = {450-456},\n  keywords = {VRU},\n  author = {Bagheri, Mehrdad and Siekkinen, Matti and Nurminen, Jukka K.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/884447MX/Bagheri et al_2014_Cellular-based vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) adaptive communication for collision.pdf},\n  note = {00030}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902598342,"version":0,"updated":1559047884508},"$loki":444},{"itemID":3241,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{rafikzitouni_application_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Application Level of {{IoT}} Networks -- {{Part}} 2},\n  pages = {23},\n  author = {Rafik Zitouni},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/8SRCZHSP/Zitouni_Paris_Application level of IoT networks -- Part 2.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902598354,"version":0,"updated":1559047884572},"$loki":445},{"itemID":3738,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@incollection{bouzouita_random_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A Random Access Model for {{M2M}} Communications in {{LTE}}-Advanced Mobile Networks},\n  isbn = {978-0-12-800887-4},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780128008874000201},\n  booktitle = {Modeling and {{Simulation}} of {{Computer Networks}} and {{Systems}}},\n  publisher = Elsevier,\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2015},\n  pages = {577-599},\n  author = {Bouzouita, Meriam and Hadjadj-Aoul, Yassine and Zangar, Nawel and Tabbane, Sami and Viho, C\\'esar},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/YMDPKI2S/Bouzouita et al_2015_A random access model for M2M communications in LTE-advanced mobile networks.pdf},\n  note = {00006}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902598376,"version":0,"updated":1559047884782},"$loki":446},{"itemID":3512,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{al-kashoash_comparison_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Comparison of {{6LoWPAN}} and {{LPWAN}} for the {{Internet}} of {{Things}}},\n  volume = {13},\n  issn = {1448-837X, 2205-362X},\n  url = {https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1448837X.2017.1409920},\n  doi = {10.1080/1448837X.2017.1409920},\n  abstract = {By 2020, 50 billion devices (things) are expected to be connected to the Internet to form the Internet of Things (IoT) world. In general, two main categories of networks are used in the IoT: short-range and long-range low-power networks. IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities. Each network category has its unique characteristics and strengths and each category has its important role in the IoT world.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {Australian Journal of Electrical and Electronics Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Aust.

However, traditional wireless networks are designed with network-centric approaches where different networks have different quality of service (QoS) strategies and cannot easily cooperate with each other to serve network users. Massive network infrastructures could not assure users perceived network and service quality, which is an indisputable fact. To address this issue, we design a new framework for heterogeneous wireless networks with the principle of user-centricity, refactoring the network from users' perspective to suffice their requirements and preferences. Different from network-centric approaches, the proposed framework takes advantage of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and virtualization technology, which will bring better perceived services quality for wireless network users. In the proposed user-centric framework, control plane and data plane are decoupled to manage the HetNets in a flexible and coadjutant way, and resource virtualization technology is introduced to abstract physical resources of HetNets into unified virtualized resources. Hence, ubiquitous and undifferentiated network connectivity and QoE (quality of experience) driven fine-grained resource management could be achieved for wireless network users.},\n  journaltitle = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  keywords = {Throughput},\n  author = {Lu, Zhaoming and Lei, Tao and Wen, Xiangming and Wang, Luhan and Chen, Xin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/6NQXK2A6/Lu et al_2016_SDN Based User-Centric Framework for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902598852,"version":0,"updated":1559047885172},"$loki":449},{"itemID":4512,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{toyooka_evaluation_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Evaluation of {{Real}}-Time Property in {{Embedded Linux}}},\n  pages = {37},\n  author = {Toyooka, Hiraku},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/4GP4KR8G/Toyooka - Evaluation of Real-time property in Embedded Linux.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902598860,"version":0,"updated":1559047885236},"$loki":450},{"itemID":3839,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{abdelgader_physical_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {The {{Physical Layer}} of the {{IEEE}} 802.11p {{WAVE Communication Standard}}: {{The Specifications}} and {{Challenges}}},\n  abstract = {In the recent years, Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) emerged with great interest due to their impact in reducing traffic jams and increasing safety as well as alternative emergency communication system in case of natural disasters, when there is lack of ordinary communication systems.

Existing map-matching algorithms are compared and contrasted with respect to positioning sensors, map qualities, assumptions and accuracies. The results of these comparisons provide interesting insights into the workings of existing algorithms and the issues they must address for improving their performance. Example findings are: (a) not all map-matching algorithms pay sufficient attention to topology of networks, directionality of roads or turn-restrictions; (b) most map-matching algorithms make an unbalanced trade-off between performance and accuracy; and (c) weight-based map-matching algorithms balance simplicity and accuracy and advanced map-matching algorithms provide high accuracy but with low performance.

Recent advances in communications, controls and embedded systems have changed this model, paving the way to the Intelligent Vehicle Grid. The car is now a formidable sensor platform, absorbing information from the environment (and from other cars) and feeding it to drivers and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control and traffic management. The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Pioneered by the Google car, the Internet of Vehicles will be a distributed transport fabric capable to make its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g., the smart building), the Internet of Vehicles will have communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers' intentions. The concept that will help transition to the Internet of Vehicles is the Vehicular Cloud, the equivalent of Internet cloud for vehicles, providing all the services required by the autonomous vehicles.

The IoT vision is to extend the Internet into our everyday lives, so the number of connected devices and innovative applications are growing very fast to bring intelligence into\nas many domains as possible. The QoS for IoT application not only depends on the Internet network and communication\ninfrastructure, it is also impacted by the operation and performance of IoT sensing infrastructure. Therefore, the new QoS parameters such as data accuracy, sampling rate, and\ndevice availability become important for the IoT applications compared to the Internet applications. The huge number of the Internet-connected IoT devices and application, and the spontaneous traffic flow among them make the management of the quality of service complex\nacross the Internet infrastructure. On the other hand, the non-IP devices and their limited capabilities in terms of energy and transmission create the dynamic environment and hinder the direct interaction between devices and applications. The quality of service is becoming one of the critical non-functional IoT element which needs research and studies. A flexible and scalable QoS management mechanism must be implemented in IoT system to keep up with the growth rate of the Internet-connected IoT devices and applications as well as their heterogeneity and diversity. The solution should address the IoT application requirements and user satisfaction while considering the system dynamism, limitations, and characteristics. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm in computer networking which separates the control plane and the data plane of the network elements. It makes the network\nelements programmable via the centralized control plane. This approach enables more agile management and control over the network behavior. In this thesis, we take advantage of SDN technology as the future of the Internet to offer a\nflexible and adaptive QoS support scheme for the IoT services. We present an SDN-based middleware to define a QoS management framework to manage the application specific QoS\nneeds across the IoT infrastructure including transport and sensing network. Also, we propose a new QoS model that takes into account the application QoS preferences and the network\nelements status to allocate effectively the resources for the applications across SDN network while maximizing network performance.},\n  institution = {{\\'Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\\'eal}},\n  type = {masters},\n  urldate = {2019-04-11},\n  date = {2018-05},\n  author = {Meshinchi, Atefeh},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/BNHZ9XGG/Meshinchi_2018_QOS-Aware and Status-Aware Adaptive Resource Allocation Framework in SDN-Based.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/F4MX94LC/3096.html},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902600642,"version":0,"updated":1559047884814},"$loki":472},{"itemID":3883,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{pham_building_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Building an {{IoT}} Device for Outdoor Usage: A Step-by-Step Tutorial},\n  pages = {26},\n  author = {Pham, Congduc},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/GTCR2UU5/Pham - Building an IoT device for outdoor usage a step-b.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902600650,"version":0,"updated":1559047884866},"$loki":473},{"itemID":3965,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{sarwar_iot_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{IoT Architecture}} : {{Elements}} of {{Connectivity Technologies}}},\n  date = {2015},\n  pages = {23},\n  keywords = {ok},\n  author = {Sarwar, Usman},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/EEH8YJ2H/Sarwar - IoT Architecture  Elements of Connectivity Techno.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/ZLCGHGHS/Sarwar - IoT Architecture  Elements of Connectivity Techno.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902600660,"version":0,"updated":1559047884886},"$loki":474},{"itemID":3771,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_future_2018,\n  title = {Future {{Directions}} in {{Connected Autonomous Vehicles}} and {{Autonomic Vehicular Networks}}},\n  date = {2018},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/KTZ79AJJ/Pres-Le-Lann-DNAC-nov-2018.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902600886,"version":0,"updated":1559047884796},"$loki":475},{"itemID":3973,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{antoniolinan_contiki_2016,\n  title = {Contiki: {{Toolchain}}},\n  date = {2016},\n  author = {{Antonio Li\\~n\\'an}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/XBG2KXSP/Day_1_-_Workshop_introduction1.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902600896,"version":0,"updated":1559047884892},"$loki":476},{"itemID":4367,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{chen_every_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Every {{Second Counts}}: {{Integrating Edge Computing}} and {{Service Oriented Architecture}} for {{Automatic Emergency Management}}},\n  volume = {2018},\n  issn = {0197-6729, 2042-3195},\n  url = {https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jat/2018/7592926/},\n  doi = {10.1155/2018/7592926},\n  shorttitle = {Every {{Second Counts}}},\n  abstract = {Emergency management has long been recognized as a social challenge due to the criticality of the response time. In emergency situations such as severe traffic accidents, minimizing the response time, which requires close collaborations between all stakeholders involved and distributed intelligence support, leads to greater survival chance of the injured. However, the current response system is far from efficient, despite the rapid development of information and communication technologies. This paper presents an automated collaboration framework for emergency management that coordinates all stakeholders within the emergency response system and fully automates the rescue process. Applying the concept of multiaccess edge computing architecture, as well as choreography of the service oriented architecture, the system allows seamless coordination between multiple organizations in a distributed way through standard web services. A service choreography is designed to globally model the emergency management process from the time an accident occurs until the rescue is finished. The choreography can be synthesized to generate detailed specification on peer-to-peer interaction logic, and then the specification can be enacted and deployed on cloud infrastructures.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Advanced Transportation},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {1-13},\n  author = {Chen, Lei and Englund, Cristofer},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/XUFTNMVT/Chen_Englund_2018_Every Second Counts.pdf},\n  note = {00007}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902600918,"version":0,"updated":1559047885058},"$loki":477},{"itemID":3283,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{alvear_ecosensor_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Coimbra, Portugal}},\n  title = {{{EcoSensor}}: {{Monitoring}} Environmental Pollution Using Mobile Sensors},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-2185-7},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7523519/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WoWMoM.2016.7523519},\n  shorttitle = {{{EcoSensor}}},\n  abstract = {Air pollution monitoring has become an essential requirement for cities worldwide.

Cars have no power constraints and they can be instrumented with high end computational units and graphic devices. The deployment at scale of urban vehicular systems, however, requires a careful design able to consider challenges across several domains. Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our field experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA). We designed and built the components for a pollution monitoring system able to support closed-loop optimization between pollution and traffic management. Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban traffic. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-field experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.},\n  number = {8},\n  journaltitle = {Signal Processing: Image Communication},\n  shortjournal = {Signal Process.

Examples of such Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN)technologies are LoRa, Sigfox and Weightless. A typicalapplication scenario for these technologies is city wide meter reading collection where devices send readings at very low frequency over a long distance to a data concentrator (one-hop networks). We argue that these transceiversare potentially very useful to construct more generic Internet of Things (IoT) networks incorporating multi-hop bi-directional communication enabling sensing and actuation. Furthermore, these transceivers have interesting features notavailable with more traditional transceivers used for IoT networks which enable construction of novel protocol elements. In this paper we present a performance and capabilityanalysis of a currently available LoRa transceiver. We describe its features and then demonstrate how such transceivercan be put to use efficiently in a wide-area application scenario. In particular we demonstrate how unique featuressuch as concurrent non-destructive transmissions and carrier detection can be employed. Our deployment experiment demonstrates that 6 LoRa nodes can form a network covering 1.5 ha in a built up environment, achieving a potential lifetime of 2 year on 2 AA batteries and delivering data within 5 s and reliability of 80\\%.},\n  booktitle = {{{EWSN}} '16 {{Proceedings}} of the 2016 {{International Conference}} on {{Embedded Wireless Systems}} and {{Networks}}},\n  publisher = {{Junction Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-04-30},\n  date = {2016-02-15},\n  pages = {361-366},\n  author = {Bor, Martin and Vidler, John Edward and Roedig, Utz},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/YP4L4CN6/Bor et al_2016_LoRa for the Internet of Things.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/PHL3UFFY/77615.html},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902601504,"version":0,"updated":1559047884928},"$loki":486},{"itemID":3785,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kochovski_formal_2019,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Formal {{Quality}} of {{Service}} Assurances, Ranking and Verification of Cloud Deployment Options with a Probabilistic Model Checking Method},\n  volume = {109},\n  issn = {09505849},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950584919300059},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.infsof.2019.01.003},\n  journaltitle = {Information and Software Technology},\n  shortjournal = {Inf.

This flexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE}} 13th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2017-10},\n  pages = {1-8},\n  author = {Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Guizar, Arturo and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/FIVDZ6UT/Ochoa et al_2017_Evaluating LoRa energy efficiency for adaptive networks.pdf},\n  note = {00016}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902602622,"version":0,"updated":1559047884690},"$loki":497},{"itemID":4378,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{duhart_resource_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Resource Oriented Framework}} for {{Service Choreography}} over {{Wireless Sensor}} and {{Actor Networks}}},\n  volume = {23},\n  issn = {1068-9605, 1572-8129},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10776-016-0316-1},\n  doi = {10.1007/s10776-016-0316-1},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {International Journal of Wireless Information Networks},\n  shortjournal = {Int J Wireless Inf Networks},\n  urldate = {2019-05-14},\n  date = {2016-09},\n  pages = {173-186},\n  author = {Duhart, Cl\\'ement and Sauvage, Pierre and Bertelle, Cyrille},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/A72SCUID/Duhart et al_2016_A Resource Oriented Framework for Service Choreography over Wireless Sensor and.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902602640,"version":0,"updated":1559047885076},"$loki":498},{"itemID":3343,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kaloop_optimizing_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Optimizing the {{De}}-{{Noise Neural Network Model}} for {{GPS Time}}-{{Series Monitoring}} of {{Structures}}},\n  volume = {15},\n  issn = {1424-8220},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/9/24428},\n  doi = {10.3390/s150924428},\n  abstract = {The Global Positioning System (GPS) is recently used widely in structures and other applications. Notwithstanding, the GPS accuracy still suffers from the errors afflicting the measurements, particularly the short-period displacement of structural components. Previously, the multi filter method is utilized to remove the displacement errors. This paper aims at using a novel application for the neural network prediction models to improve the GPS monitoring time series data. Four prediction models for the learning algorithms are applied and used with neural network solutions: back-propagation, Cascade-forward back-propagation, adaptive filter and extended Kalman filter, to estimate which model can be recommended. The noise simulation and bridge's short-period GPS of the monitoring displacement component of one Hz sampling frequency are used to validate the four models and the previous method. The results show that the Adaptive neural networks filter is suggested for de-noising the observations, specifically for the GPS displacement components of structures. Also, this model is expected to have significant influence on the design of structures in the low frequency responses and measurements' contents.},\n  number = {9},\n  journaltitle = Sensors,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-09-22},\n  pages = {24428-24444},\n  keywords = {ANN,GPS},\n  author = {Kaloop, Mosbeh and Hu, Jong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/TKQW8UQ7/Kaloop_Hu_2015_Optimizing the De-Noise Neural Network Model for GPS Time-Series Monitoring of.pdf},\n  note = {00010}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902602906,"version":0,"updated":1559047884624},"$loki":499},{"itemID":3746,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{_getting_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Getting Started with the {{Contiki OS}}/{{6LoWPAN}}  on {{STM32 Nucleo}} with {{SPIRIT1}} and Sensors Expansion Boards},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {24},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/RZ3BLYY3/Getting started with the Contiki OS-6LoWPAN on STM32 Nucleo with SPIRIT1 and.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902602918,"version":0,"updated":1559047884786},"$loki":500},{"itemID":3774,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_short_2007,\n  title = {Short {{Term Traffic Prediction Models}}},\n  date = {2007},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/VJYRRTY3/Short_Term_Traffic_Prediction_Models.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902602926,"version":0,"updated":1559047884798},"$loki":501},{"itemID":3776,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_contiki_2016a,\n  title = {Contiki Applications for {{Z1}} Motes for {{6LowPAN}}},\n  url = {https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/82767/Master%20Thesis.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y},\n  urldate = {2019-01-14},\n  date = {2016},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/4L7B4HS6/Master Thesis.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902602934,"version":0,"updated":1559047884802},"$loki":502},{"itemID":3142,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{david_uppaal_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Uppaal {{SMC}} Tutorial},\n  volume = {17},\n  issn = {1433-2779, 1433-2787},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10009-014-0361-y},\n  doi = {10.1007/s10009-014-0361-y},\n  abstract = {This tutorial paper surveys the main features of Uppaal SMC, a model checking approach in Uppaal family that allows us to reason on networks of complex real-timed systems with a stochastic semantic.

In this paper, we propose an urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and hidden Markov models (HMM). Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac\\- curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth\\- ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip\\- tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experiments for pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification are con\\- ducted independently and both methods achieve nearly 90\\% on classification.},\n  eventtitle = {2012 15th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}} - ({{ITSC}} 2012)},\n  booktitle = {2012 15th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2012-09},\n  pages = {67-72},\n  author = {Takahashi, Toshimitsu and Kim, HyungKwan and Kamijo, Shunsuke},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/M5JU9NJ4/Takahashi et al_2012_Urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and HMM.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902603212,"version":0,"updated":1559047884636},"$loki":504},{"itemID":3853,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{pham_lowcost_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Low-Cost {{LoRa}} Gateway: A Step-by-Step Tutorial},\n  pages = {92},\n  author = {Pham, Congduc},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/GSDRCMZ8/Pham - Low-cost LoRa gateway a step-by-step tutorial.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902603220,"version":0,"updated":1559047884854},"$loki":505},{"itemID":4385,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{shankarpandey_service_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Service {{Selection Based}} on {{Dominant Role}} of the {{Choreography}}},\n  volume = {7},\n  issn = {22307702, 09769811},\n  url = {http://www.aircconline.com/ijwsc/V7N1/7116ijwsc02.pdf},\n  doi = {10.5121/ijwsc.2016.7102},\n  abstract = {Web services are playing dominant role on Internet for e-business.

Urban planners are looking for solutions to reduce traffic congestion. Realtime traffic information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and traffic control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}} ({{IMIS}})},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-06},\n  pages = {450-455},\n  author = {Kim, Wooseong and Gerla, Mario},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/U28YNY9U/Kim_Gerla_2011_NAVOPT.pdf},\n  note = {00022}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902604102,"version":0,"updated":1559047884656},"$loki":515},{"itemID":3608,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{deng_applicationaware_2018,\n  title = {An {{Application}}-Aware {{QoS Routing Algorithm}} for {{SDN}}-Based {{IoT Networking}}},\n  doi = {10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538551},\n  abstract = {With numerous emerging internet of things (IoT) devices, they generate big data. The big data transmitted to the cloud or fog will consume massive network bandwidth. This may result in the IoT network easily encountering network congestion. Moreover, there are IoT applications that need to transfer multimedia data with multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements. A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed. The AQRA improves the average end-to-end flow performance by 10.75\\%, 11.88\\% and 10.82\\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. The AQRA improves the standard deviation of end-to-end flow performance by 14.37\\%, 17.95\\% and 14.28\\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively.

The massive deployment of such devices may overwhelm the cellular network by imposing strong constraints on the Radio Access Network (RAN) because of the radio resources' scarcity. As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would efficiently help to overcome the risk of congestion. In this paper, we proposed a novel fluid model for M2M communications, which allows gaining an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of such systems. The provided analysis of the model was used to devise a new method to estimate accurately the number of M2M devices willing to connect as well as the number of random access attempts.We proposed, then, a novel implementation of the ACB process, which dynamically computes the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions while includes a corrective action adapting the controller action based on the mismatch existing between the computed and the targeted mean load. Compared to existing approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms allow improving considerably the estimation of the number of M2M devices' arrivals, while outperforming existing techniques in terms of the number of abandons, the success and the collision probabilities, and the average access delay.},\n  eventtitle = {The 19th {{ACM International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 19th {{ACM International Conference}} on {{Modeling}}, {{Analysis}} and {{Simulation}} of {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Systems}} - {{MSWiM}} '16},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {287-291},\n  author = {Bouzouita, Meriam and Hadjadj-Aoul, Yassine and Zangar Tunisia, Nawel and Rubino, Gerardo and Tabbane, Sami},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/W7VBDTD4/Bouzouita et al_2016_Dynamic Adaptive Access Barring Scheme For Heavily Congested M2M Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902604408,"version":0,"updated":1559047884776},"$loki":519},{"itemID":4067,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_evaluation_,\n  title = {\\'Evaluation et Am\\'elioration Des Plates-Formes Logicielles Pour R\\'eseaux de Capteurs sans-Fil, Pour Optimiser La Qualit\\'e de Service et l'\\'energie},\n  url = {http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2016_0051_ROUSSEL.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-04-17},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/N8LVHV5W/DDOC_T_2016_0051_ROUSSEL.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902604418,"version":0,"updated":1559047884962},"$loki":520},{"itemID":4510,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{laux_demo_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Columbus, OH, USA}},\n  title = {Demo: {{OpenC2X}} \\textemdash{} {{An}} Open Source Experimental and Prototyping Platform Supporting {{ETSI ITS}}-{{G5}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-5197-7},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7835955/},\n  doi = {10.1109/VNC.2016.7835955},\n  shorttitle = {Demo},\n  abstract = {Vehicular networking is at the corner from early research to final deployment.

This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion. One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances. Thus, we proposed, in this paper, a new method to estimate accurately the number of random access attempts in a way to measure efficiently the congestion level. Then, we proposed a novel implementation of the ACB process that mainly consists of dynamically adapting the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions by improving significantly the access's success probability while minimizing radio resources' underutilization.

Hence, to deal with random access channel (RACH) overload and to better control the access in LTE-A Networks, the 3GPP proposed the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor concept. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve this method based on adaptive multiple ACB factors, according to M2M traffic category with respect to their access delay budget and drop rate (QoS parameters). Simulations were done for testing the effectiveness of our MACB scheme and show that using multiples ACB factors and dynamically adjusting them to the congestion level in addition to traffic type category increases the access probability and reduces overload. The obtained results were then compared to the basic ACB method and show that the access probability increases especially for high priority traffic.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 13th {{IEEE Annual Consumer Communications}} \\& {{Networking Conference}} ({{CCNC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2016-01},\n  pages = {693-698},\n  author = {Zangar, Nawel and Gharbi, Sami and Abdennebi, Marwen},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/QPWEPI5R/Zangar et al_2016_Service differentiation strategy based on MACB factor for M2M Communications in.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902605006,"version":0,"updated":1559047884780},"$loki":528},{"itemID":4102,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{varsier_capacity_2017,\n  location = {{Paris, France}},\n  title = {Capacity Limits of {{LoRaWAN}} Technology for Smart Metering Applications},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-8999-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7996383/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICC.2017.7996383},\n  eventtitle = {{{ICC}} 2017 - 2017 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}}},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE International Conference}} on {{Communications}} ({{ICC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-05},\n  date = {2017-05},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Varsier, Nadege and Schwoerer, Jean},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/FLWU4Q98/Varsier_Schwoerer_2017_Capacity limits of LoRaWAN technology for smart metering applications.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902605034,"version":0,"updated":1559047884978},"$loki":529},{"itemID":3229,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{pikridas_estimation_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Estimation and Evaluation of {{GPS}} Geoid Heights Using an Artificial Neural Network Model},\n  volume = {3},\n  issn = {1866-9298, 1866-928X},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12518-011-0052-2},\n  doi = {10.1007/s12518-011-0052-2},\n  abstract = {The aim of the present study is the employment of the artificial neural network (ANN) model in the estimation and evaluation of geoid heights.

In this letter, we analyze LoRa systems for increasing average system packet success probability (PSP) under unslotted ALOHA random access protocol. The lower bound for average system PSP is derived when many contending EDs are transmitting by stochastic geometry. And it is shown that the average system PSP can be maximized by properly allocating an SF to each traffic, which also maximizes connectivity of EDs. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the average system PSP to propose a sub-optimal SF allocation scheme to each traffic. Analysis on PSP is validated through simulations, and comparison with existing schemes reveals that our proposed scheme achieves the highest PSP and so the maximum connectivity.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Letters},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the offered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of e ciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for different multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of different parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study. In the first part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user's preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario.

In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users' complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufficient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great influences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper first defines the SFSD and describes the important influences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  urldate = {2019-04-27},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {39895-39906},\n  author = {Min, Xunyou and Xu, Xiaofei and Liu, Zhizhong and Chu, Dianhui and Wang, Zhongjie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/I8KMID9I/Min et al. - 2018 - An Approach to Resource and QoS-Aware Services Opt.pdf},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902605888,"version":0,"updated":1559047884900},"$loki":541},{"itemID":4052,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{rafikzitouni_lab12312_2016,\n  title = {Lab1-23-12.Pdf},\n  date = {2016},\n  author = {{Rafik Zitouni}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/E53R3NLK/Lab1-23-12.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902605896,"version":0,"updated":1559047884940},"$loki":542},{"itemID":3239,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{rafikzitouni_architecture_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Architecture of {{Wireless Networks}} for {{IoT}}},\n  pages = {48},\n  author = {{Rafik Zitouni}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/B36RRXJQ/Zitouni_Paris_Architecture of Wireless Networks for IoT.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902606458,"version":0,"updated":1559047884568},"$loki":543},{"itemID":3373,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{lv_traffic_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Traffic {{Flow Prediction With Big Data}}: {{A Deep Learning Approach}}},\n  issn = {1524-9050, 1558-0016},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6894591},\n  doi = {10.1109/TITS.2014.2345663},\n  shorttitle = {Traffic {{Flow Prediction With Big Data}}},\n  abstract = {Accurate and timely traffic flow information is important for the successful deployment of intelligent transportation systems. Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation.

This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction.

Providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in such frameworks is highly challenging because of the dynamic and loosely coupled nature of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). A framework called the SPontaneous Information and Resource sharing InfrasTructure (SPIRIT) has been presented before to address the challenges of proximity-aware mobile sensor sharing. SPIRIT allows mobile applications to share sensors as services in an automatic fashion by enabling the service providers and clients to express a variety of QoS specifications. This paper presents a set of mobility-aware QoS mechanisms for enabling the implementation of QoS specifications along the multihop paths between service providers and clients in highly mobile environments. Simulations in small-scale Mobile Ad Hoc Networks show SPIRIT's ability to effectively control and manage traffic flows while maintaining desired QoS. The implications of the proposed QoS mechanisms extend beyond the scope of SPIRIT, as QoS provisioning is an important issue in many MANET frameworks and applications including Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs).},\n  journaltitle = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Mobile Information Systems},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-19},\n  author = {Mitra, Pramita and Golestanian, Mehdi and Poellabauer, Christian},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/A7QBLTX5/Mitra et al_2016_Quality of Service Specifications in Small-Scale Proximity-Aware Mobile Sensor.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902606550,"version":0,"updated":1559047885170},"$loki":546},{"itemID":2963,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{xu_jamming_2006,\n  title = {Jamming Sensor Networks: Attack and Defense Strategies},\n  volume = {20},\n  issn = {0890-8044},\n  doi = {10.1109/MNET.2006.1637931},\n  shorttitle = {Jamming Sensor Networks},\n  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are built upon a shared medium that makes it easy for adversaries to conduct radio interference, or jamming, attacks that effectively cause a denial of service of either transmission or reception functionalities.

In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats).

In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches.

For the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the sequence of rewards is chosen by an oblivious adversary, the notion of best arm during the time horizon is too restrictive for applications such as ad-serving, where the best ad could change during time range. In this paper, we consider a variant of the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the time horizon is divided into unknown time periods within which rewards are drawn from stochastic distributions. During each time period, there is an optimal arm which may be different from the optimal arm at the previous time period. We present an algorithm taking advantage of the constant exploration of EXP3 to detect when the best arm changes. Its analysis shows that on a run divided into N periods where the best arm changes, the proposed algorithms achieves a regret in O(N {$\\surd$}T log T).},\n  journaltitle = {2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)},\n  shortjournal = {2015 IEEE Int.

The problem consists in the selection of the most suitable from all radio access technologies available. The decision process is called network selection, and depends on several parameters, such as quality of service, mobility, cost, energy, battery life, etc. Several methods and approaches have been proposed in this context, with their objective being to offer the best QoS to the users, and/or to maximize re-usability of the networks.

Pedestrian safety measures, including infrastructure enhancements and passive safety features in vehicles, are described, followed by a systematic description of active safety systems based on pedestrian detection using sensors in vehicle and infrastructure. The pedestrian detection approaches are classified according to various criteria such as the type and configuration of sensors, as well as the video cues and classifiers used in detection algorithms. It is noted that collision avoidance not only requires detection of pedestrians but also requires collision prediction using pedestrian dynamics and behavior analysis. Hence, this paper includes research dealing with probabilistic modeling of pedestrian behavior for predicting collisions between pedestrians and vehicles.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Being SDR-based, the transceiver offers important benefits: It provides access to all data down to and including the physical layer, allowing for a better understanding of the system. Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modified. Finally, it enables a seamless switch between simulations and experiments and, thus, helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Comparing the transceiver's performance with independent results from simulations and experiments, we underline its potential to be used as a tool for further studies of IEEE 802.11p networks both in field operational tests as well as for simulation-based development of novel physical layer solutions.

In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a network selection scheme, which is for users that select an optimal network with best comprehensive performance between different types of networks. However, the optimal network may be not the most reasonable one due to compensation of MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making), and the network is called pseudo-optimal network. This paper conducts a performance evaluation of a number of widely used MADM-based methods for network selection that aim to keep the mobile users always best connected anywhere and anytime, where subjective weight and objective weight are all considered. The performance analysis shows that the selection scheme based on MEW (weighted multiplicative method) and combination weight can better avoid accessing pseudo-optimal network for balancing network load and reducing ping-pong effect in comparison with three other MADM solutions.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  author = {Zhou, Jian and Zhu, Can-yan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/INK55447/Zhou_Zhu_2016_Compensatory Analysis and Optimization for MADM for Heterogeneous Wireless.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902608674,"version":0,"updated":1559047885158},"$loki":573},{"itemID":4457,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_lowpower_,\n  title = {Low-Power, {{Long}}-Range {{WAN}} for {{IoT}}: A Technology Overview},\n  url = {http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/Paper/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/3BE7JT5S/Talk-Rescom-16-LPWAN-review.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902608682,"version":0,"updated":1559047885196},"$loki":574},{"itemID":3960,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pham_hardware_,\n  title = {Hardware},\n  author = {{Pham}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/3G2EQTI5/low-cost-iot-hardware-parts.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902608998,"version":0,"updated":1559047884884},"$loki":576},{"itemID":4057,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pham_lowcost_g,\n  title = {Low-Cost {{LoRa IoT}} Device: A Step-by-Step Tutorial},\n  author = {{Pham}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/DSDKZMDR/RESSACS16-Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902609010,"version":0,"updated":1559047884948},"$loki":577},{"itemID":4511,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{huang_effectively_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Effectively {{Measure}} and {{Reduce Kernel Latencies}} for {{Real}}-Time {{Constraints}}},\n  pages = {61},\n  author = {Huang, Jim},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/6I2V2UPW/Huang - Effectively Measure and Reduce Kernel Latencies fo.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902609026,"version":0,"updated":1559047885234},"$loki":578},{"itemID":3039,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{stolfi_red_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Red {{Swarm}}: {{Reducing}} Travel Times in Smart Cities by Using Bio-Inspired Algorithms},\n  volume = {24},\n  issn = {15684946},\n  url = {http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1568494614003457},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.asoc.2014.07.014},\n  shorttitle = {Red {{Swarm}}},\n  abstract = {This article presents an innovative approach to solve one of the most relevant problems related to smart mobility: the reduction of vehicles' travel time. Our original approach, called Red Swarm, suggests a potentially customized route to each vehicle by using several spots located at traffic lights in order to avoid traffic jams by using V2I communications. That is quite different from other existing proposals, as it deals with real maps and actual streets, as well as several road traffic distributions. We propose an evolutionary algorithm (later efficiently parallelized) to optimize our case studies which have been imported from OpenStreetMap into SUMO as they belong to a real city. We have also developed a Rerouting Algorithm which accesses the configuration of the Red Swarm and communicates the route chosen to vehicles, using the spots (via WiFi link). Moreover, we have developed three competing algorithms in order to compare their results to those of Red Swarm and have observed that Red Swarm not only achieved the best results, but also outperformed the experts' solutions in a total of 60 scenarios tested, with up to 19\\% shorter travel times.},\n  journaltitle = {Applied Soft Computing},\n  shortjournal = {Appl.

Hence, a set of unique predefined line commands and operating systems or firmware should be used. SDN (software-defined networking) is a structure designed for simplifying and improving network management with high flexibility by splitting control plane and data plane. Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities. Although SDN is regarded as a new research issue, it has attracted numerous researchers' attention from both industrial and academic institutes. In this paper, data plane, control plane and application plane as the three planes of SDN and the interfaces between them such as OpenFlow are investigated and the challenges and the latest technologies in relation to SDN are examined. The investigation and overview of SDN reported in this paper might be used by the interested future researchers to better understand and apply SDN in real-life applications.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {J.

This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative study of these technologies, which serve as efficient solutions to connect smart, autonomous, and heterogeneous devices. We show that Sigfox and LoRa are advantageous in terms of battery lifetime, capacity, and cost. Meanwhile, NB-IoT offers benefits in terms of latency and quality of service.

In fact, a large number of devices may attempt simultaneously to access the base station, which may result in severe congestions at the random-access channel (RACH) level. To alleviate such congestion while regulating the M2M devices' opportunities to transmit, the Access Class Barring (ACB) process was proposed. In this article, we propose a novel implementation of the ACB mechanism in the context of multiple M2M traffic classes. Based on a scheduling algorithm, we have applied a PID controller to adjust dynamically multiple ACB factors related to each class category, guaranteeing a number of devices around an optimal value that maximizes the Random Access (RA) success probability. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism by increasing the success probability and minimizing radio resources' underutilization with respect to each class priority.},\n  eventtitle = {The 18th {{ACM International Conference}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 18th {{ACM International Conference}} on {{Modeling}}, {{Analysis}} and {{Simulation}} of {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Systems}} - {{MSWiM}} '15},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-03-24},\n  date = {2015},\n  pages = {195-199},\n  author = {Bouzouita, Meriam and Hadjadj-Aoul, Yassine and Zangar, Nawel and Rubino, Gerardo and Tabbane, Sami},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/A6J9RJCE/Bouzouita et al_2015_Multiple Access Class Barring Factors Algorithm for M2M Communications in.pdf},\n  note = {00003}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902610056,"version":0,"updated":1559047884774},"$loki":587},{"itemID":3806,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bari_automated_2007,\n  title = {Automated Network Selection in a Heterogeneous Wireless Network Environment},\n  volume = {21},\n  issn = {0890-8044},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4107918/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MNET.2007.314536},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Network},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Netw.},\n  urldate = {2019-04-13},\n  date = {2007-01},\n  pages = {34-40},\n  author = {Bari, Farooq and Leung, Victor},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/SM8ZITCD/Bari_Leung_2007_Automated network selection in a heterogeneous wireless network environment.pdf},\n  note = {00282}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902610074,"version":0,"updated":1559047884820},"$loki":588},{"itemID":3972,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{antoniolinan_contiki_,\n  title = {Contiki: {{Zolertia}}},\n  author = {{Antonio Li\\~n\\'an}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/J5PEEE7S/Day_1_-_Zolertia_Introduction1.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902610082,"version":0,"updated":1559047884890},"$loki":589},{"itemID":4062,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{pham_lowcostloraghanaispacepublicevent_,\n  title = {Low-Cost-{{LoRa}}-{{Ghana}}-{{iSpace}}-Public-Event.Pdf},\n  author = {{Pham}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/M383K5LZ/Low-cost-LoRa-Ghana-iSpace-public-event.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902610090,"version":0,"updated":1559047884956},"$loki":590},{"itemID":3045,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{garcia-nieto_enhancing_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Cordoba, Spain}},\n  title = {Enhancing the Urban Road Traffic with {{Swarm Intelligence}}: {{A}} Case Study of {{C}}\\&\\#{{x00F3}};Rdoba City Downtown},\n  isbn = {978-1-4577-1676-8 978-1-4577-1675-1},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6121683/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ISDA.2011.6121683},\n  shorttitle = {Enhancing the Urban Road Traffic with {{Swarm Intelligence}}},\n  abstract = {In current modern cities, the increasing number of traffic lights that control the vehicular traffic flow requires a highly complex scheduling.

Unfortunately, GPS data is still plagued with errors that frequently produce inaccurate trajectories. Research in map matching algorithms focuses on how to efficiently match GPS tracking data to the underlying road network. This article presents an innovative map matching algorithm that considers the trajectory of the data rather than merely the current position as in the typical map matching case. Instead of computing the precise angle which is traditionally used, a discrete eightdirection chain code, to represent a trend of movement, is used. Coupled with distance information, map matching decisions are made by comparing the differences between trajectories representing the road segments and GPS tracking data chain-codes. Moreover, to contrast the performance of the chain-code algorithm, two evaluation strategies, linear and non-linear, are analyzed. The presented chain-code map matching algorithm was evaluated for wheelchair navigation using university campus sidewalk data. The evaluation results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in terms of accuracy and computational time.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Transactions in GIS},\n  shortjournal = {Trans.

Within this family of possible technology choices, two different branches have emerged: the standards based on spreaded wideband communication and the standards based on narrowband communication, both promising to reach long range connectivity at very low power. More specifically, this paper focuses on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This paper presents a detailed model of CSS, showing that the symbols are not perfectly orthogonal. The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufficient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{Symposium}} on {{Communications}} and {{Vehicular Technologies}} ({{SCVT}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-06},\n  date = {2016-11},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  author = {Reynders, Brecht and Pollin, Sofie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/R7878J4S/Reynders and Pollin - 2016 - Chirp spread spectrum as a modulation technique fo.pdf},\n  note = {00051}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902610686,"version":0,"updated":1559047885006},"$loki":596},{"itemID":4300,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{croce_impact_2018,\n  title = {Impact of {{LoRa Imperfect Orthogonality}}: {{Analysis}} of {{Link}}-{{Level Performance}}},\n  volume = {22},\n  issn = {1089-7798},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267219/},\n  doi = {10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2797057},\n  shorttitle = {Impact of {{LoRa Imperfect Orthogonality}}},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Letters},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

We decentralize the problem by managing the traffic of each intersection independently from others. We define control agents which are able to synchronize the multiple flows of vehicles in each intersection, by alternating vehicles from both directions. We present experimental results in simulation, which allow to evaluate the approach and to compare it with a traffic light strategy.

A simple two-slope line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight outdoor path loss model is proposed and compared to different existing path loss models. The outdoor path loss is found to be approximately 5 dB higher for 3.5 GHz compared to 1.9 GHz. The outdoor-to-indoor propagation is investigated for two office buildings and different street shops. For the different presented scenarios, penetration loss increases with frequency and is found to be up to 5 dB higher for 3.5 GHz compared with 1.9 GHz.

Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones).

Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\\% of overall throughput, 15\\% of the time.

We consider two classical problems: (1) identify a best arm with high probability (best arm identification), for which the performance measure by the sample complexity (number of samples before finding a near-optimal arm). To this end, we naturally extend the definition of sample complexity so that it makes sense in the switching best arm setting, which may be of independent interest.

The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction.

Our method is broadly applicable to channel estimation for multicarrier signals with any number of antennas, and has low enough complexity to be used in a mobile station. The proposed deep channel estimator can outperform LS estimation with nearly the same complexity, and approach MMSE estimation performance to within 1 dB without knowing the second order statistics. The only complexity increase with respect to LS estimator lies in fitting the parameters of a deep neural network (DNN) periodically on the order of the channel coherence time. We empirically show that the main benefit of this method accrues from the ability of this specially designed DNN to exploit correlations in the time-frequency grid. The proposed estimator can also reduce the number of pilot tones needed in an OFDM time-frequency grid, e.g. in an LTE scenario by 98\\% (68\\%) when the channel coherence time interval is 73ms (4.5ms).},\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2019-04-19},\n  keywords = {Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing},\n  author = {Balevi, Eren and Andrews, Jeffrey G.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/2BN4HZ5J/Balevi_Andrews_2019_Deep Learning-Based Channel Estimation for High-Dimensional Signals.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/H33EMTGV/1904.html},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902613762,"version":0,"updated":1559047885162},"$loki":626},{"itemID":3663,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kobo_survey_2017,\n  title = {A {{Survey}} on {{Software}}-{{Defined Wireless Sensor Networks}}: {{Challenges}} and {{Design Requirements}}},\n  volume = {5},\n  issn = {2169-3536},\n  doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2666200},\n  shorttitle = {A {{Survey}} on {{Software}}-{{Defined Wireless Sensor Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN) brings about innovation, simplicity in network management, and configuration in network computing. Traditional networks often lack the flexibility to bring into effect instant changes because of the rigidity of the network and also the over dependence on proprietary services. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, thus moving the control logic from the node to a central controller. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a great platform for low-rate wireless personal area networks with little resources and short communication ranges. However, as the scale of WSN expands, it faces several challenges, such as network management and heterogeneous-node networks. The SDN approach to WSNs seeks to alleviate most of the challenges and ultimately foster efficiency and sustainability in WSNs. The fusion of these two models gives rise to a new paradigm: Software defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSN). The SDWSN model is also envisioned to play a critical role in the looming Internet of Things paradigm. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the SDWSN literature. Moreover, it delves into some of the challenges facing this paradigm, as well as the major SDWSN design requirements that need to be considered to address these challenges.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Access},\n  date = {2017},\n  pages = {1872-1899},\n  author = {Kobo, H.

In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers' behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to define the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed field tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

New type of connectivity used in LowPower Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech's LoRaTM technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes - LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our findings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks.

Network information, that is periodically broadcasted, assists mobile users in their decisions. By broadcasting appropriate decisional information, the network tries to globally control users decision in a way to meet operator objectives. On the other hand, mobiles also integrate their needs and preferences to select their access technology so as to maximize their own utility. In comparison with other RAT selection techniques, including network-centric, hybrid and user-centric methods, simulation results prove the efficiency of our hybrid approach in enhancing resource utilization and maximizing user satisfaction.},\n  eventtitle = {2013 {{IEEE}} 9th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2013 {{IEEE}} 9th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-14},\n  date = {2013-10},\n  pages = {521-528},\n  author = {Helou, Melhem El and Ibrahim, Marc and Lahoud, Samer and Khawam, Kinda},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/HG9H96IA/Helou et al. - 2013 - Radio access selection approaches in heterogeneous.pdf},\n  note = {00013}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902615300,"version":0,"updated":1559047884832},"$loki":643},{"itemID":4137,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{gur_stochastic_2014,\n  title = {Stochastic {{Multi}}-{{Armed}}-{{Bandit Problem}} with {{Non}}-Stationary {{Rewards}}},\n  abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem a gambler needs to choose at each round of play one of K arms, each characterized by an unknown reward distribution. Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler's objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T . To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T . This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward ``variation'' and the minimal achievable regret, and by establishing a connection between the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},\n  booktitle = NIPS,\n  date = {2014},\n  author = {Gur, Yonatan and Zeevi, Assaf J. and Besbes, Omar},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/USD3V3PR/Gur et al_2014_Stochastic Multi-Armed-Bandit Problem with Non-stationary Rewards.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902615322,"version":0,"updated":1559047884990},"$loki":644},{"itemID":4456,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@video{congducpham_extreme_,\n  title = {Extreme Low-Cost \\& Low-Power {{LoRa IoT DIY}} Tutorial},\n  url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsKbJeeav_M},\n  urldate = {2019-05-19},\n  director = {{Congduc Pham}},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902615338,"version":0,"updated":1559047885194},"$loki":645},{"itemID":4463,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{baccelli_riot_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{RIOT}}: {{An Open Source Operating System}} for {{Low}}-{{End Embedded Devices}} in the {{IoT}}},\n  volume = {5},\n  issn = {2327-4662, 2372-2541},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8315125/},\n  doi = {10.1109/JIOT.2018.2815038},\n  shorttitle = {{{RIOT}}},\n  abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges, compact operating systems are required on low-end devices to ease development and portability of IoT applications.

In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is explored to improve the segment identification accuracy of map-matching algorithms. The proposed ANN is continuously trained by using the horizontal shift imposed on GPS points and once it is trained, it will be used to correct raw GPS points before inputting them into the map-matching algorithm. Integrating the proposed ANN enabled an existing map-matching algorithm to find the correct segments for some of the GPS points where the original map-matching algorithm had failed to do so.},\n  eventtitle = {2016 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Conference}} on {{Information Reuse}} and {{Integration}} ({{IRI}})},\n  booktitle = {2016 {{IEEE}} 17th {{International Conference}} on {{Information Reuse}} and {{Integration}} ({{IRI}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016-07},\n  pages = {77-86},\n  keywords = {ANN,GPS,MapMatching},\n  author = {Hashemi, Mahdi and Karimi, Hassan A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/AUG6X2BX/Hashemi_Karimi_2016_A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accuracy of GPS-Based Map-Matching.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902615634,"version":0,"updated":1559047884542},"$loki":647},{"itemID":3480,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{dossantossoares_modular_2012,\n  title = {A Modular {{Petri}} Net to Modeling and Scenario Analysis of a Network of Road Traffic Signals},\n  volume = {20},\n  issn = {0967-0661},\n  url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096706611200127X},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.conengprac.2012.06.005},\n  abstract = {The dynamic behavior of a group of traffic signals controlling a network of intersections is a complex discrete event system that can be modeled by Petri nets.

The specified models are simulated through the common token player algorithm, and formal analysis using invariants and theorem proving are applied to verify models' soundness and to reason on specific scenarios.},\n  number = {11},\n  journaltitle = {Control Engineering Practice},\n  shortjournal = {Control Engineering Practice},\n  series = {Special {{Section}}: {{Wiener}}-{{Hammerstein System Identification Benchmark}}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-27},\n  date = {2012-11-01},\n  pages = {1183-1194},\n  author = {family=Santos Soares, given=Michel, prefix=dos, useprefix=true and Vrancken, Jos},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/QIMUPH6I/dos Santos Soares_Vrancken_2012_A modular Petri net to modeling and scenario analysis of a network of road.pdf},\n  note = {00017}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902615668,"version":0,"updated":1559047884700},"$loki":648},{"itemID":3877,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{pham_lowcost_a,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Low-Cost {{LoRa Collar}} for Cattle Rustling Applications},\n  pages = {48},\n  author = {Pham, Congduc},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/BRSNZ3IX/Pham - Low-cost LoRa Collar for cattle rustling applicati.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902615678,"version":0,"updated":1559047884858},"$loki":649},{"itemID":4432,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{moraes_publish_2018,\n  title = {A {{Publish}}/{{Subscribe Qos}}-{{Aware Framework For Massive Iot Traffic Orchestration}}},\n  url = {https://zenodo.org/record/1098298},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1098298},\n  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) application deployment requires the allocation of resources such as virtual machines, storage, and network elements that must be deployed over distinct infrastructures such as cloud computing, Cloud of Things (CoT), datacenters and backbone networks. For massive IoT data acquisition, a gateway-based data aggregation approach is commonly used featuring sensor/ actuator seamless access and providing cache/ buffering and preprocessing functionality. In this perspective, gateways acting as producers need to allocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is proposed a Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework (PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources between aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules IoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally,  the framework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled backbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users and consumers. Network resources are allocated using a Bandwidth Allocation Model (BAM) to achieve efficient network resource allocation for scheduled IoT data streams. PSIoT-Orch adopts an ICN (Information-Centric Network) PubSub architecture approach to handle IoT data transfers requests among framework components. The proposed framework aims at gathering the inherent advantages of an ICN-centric approach using a PubSub message scheme while allocating resources efficiently keeping QoS awareness and handling restricted network resources (bandwidth) for massive IoT traffic.},\n  journaltitle = Zenodo,\n  urldate = {2019-05-17},\n  date = {2018-01-10},\n  author = {Moraes, Pedro Francesco and Reale, Rafael F. and Martins, Joberto S.

On the contrary, the smartphone industry is advancing quickly. Existing smartphones are endowed with multiple wireless interfaces and high computational power, being able to perform a wide variety of tasks. By combining smartphones with existing vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and services when driving. In this paper we propose an Androidbased application that monitors the vehicle through an On Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) interface, being able to detect accidents. Our proposed application estimates the G force experienced by the passengers in case of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to detect accidents. The application reacts to positive detection by sending details about the accident through either e-mail or SMS to pre-defined destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone call to the emergency services. Experimental results using a real vehicle show that the application is able to react to accident events in less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{IEEE}} 36th {{Conference}} on {{Local Computer Networks}} ({{LCN}} 2011)},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{IEEE}} 36th {{Conference}} on {{Local Computer Networks}}},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-10},\n  pages = {813-819},\n  author = {Zaldivar, Jorge and Calafate, Carlos T. and Cano, Juan Carlos and Manzoni, Pietro},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/WB5YVW29/Zaldivar et al_2011_Providing accident detection in vehicular networks through OBD-II devices and.pdf},\n  note = {00189}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902616440,"version":0,"updated":1559047884616},"$loki":655},{"itemID":3337,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{alba_intelligent_2016,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Denver, Colorado, USA}},\n  title = {Intelligent {{Systems}} for {{Smart Cities}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-4323-7},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2908961.2927000},\n  doi = {10.1145/2908961.2927000},\n  eventtitle = {The 2016},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2016 on {{Genetic}} and {{Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion}} - {{GECCO}} '16 {{Companion}}},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016},\n  pages = {823-839},\n  author = {Alba, Enrique},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/9JTDGC6B/Alba_2016_Intelligent Systems for Smart Cities.pdf},\n  note = {00004}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902616458,"version":0,"updated":1559047884620},"$loki":656},{"itemID":4460,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_riot_,\n  title = {Riot},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/TLMJNEN6/osis201620160305journee-iotriotbaccelli-160510124208.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902616466,"version":0,"updated":1559047885200},"$loki":657},{"itemID":4507,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{parra_analysis_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Los Angeles, CA, USA}},\n  title = {Analysis of {{ITS}}-{{G5A V2X}} Communications Performance in Autonomous Cooperative Driving Experiments},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-4804-5},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7995982/},\n  doi = {10.1109/IVS.2017.7995982},\n  abstract = {In this paper the performance of ITS-G5A communications for an autonomous driving application is analyzed in a real high-density scenario.

In the competition, between 8-10 autonomous vehicles formed two platoons in different lanes and were required to merge into a predefined competition zone. The performance is characterized using CAM CCDFs which serves as a base for the evaluation of a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control application. Two important effects has been identified that affect to the reliability of the communications. Firstly, there is a degradation with the distance that appears to be stronger for cars and more gentle for trucks. This indicates that occlusions heavily affect the connectivity of ITS-G5A. Secondly, the reliability is below expectations and some of the vehicles perform consistently worse than others. Although further investigation is required, a possible explanation for this is that a highly congested channel is making some of the vehicles get stuck and are not able to regularly access the channel.},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium}} ({{IV}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-23},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {1899-1903},\n  author = {Parra, Ignacio and Garcia-Morcillo, Alvaro and Izquierdo, Ruben and Alonso, Javier and Fernandez-Llorca, D. and Sotelo, M.A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/MJX82H6U/Parra et al. - 2017 - Analysis of ITS-G5A V2X communications performance.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902616496,"version":0,"updated":1559047885226},"$loki":658},{"itemID":4049,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@misc{_ubidots_b,\n  title = {Ubidots\\_{{Day3}}\\_{{ConsrtuyendoIoT}}.Pptx},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/TMWG42SW/1-Ubidots_Day3_ConsrtuyendoIoT.pptx},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":37,"created":1558902616730,"version":0,"updated":1559047884936},"$loki":659},{"itemID":4326,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{raza_low_22,\n  title = {Low {{Power Wide Area Networks}}: {{An Overview}}},\n  volume = {19},\n  issn = {1553-877X},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7815384/},\n  doi = {10.1109/COMST.2017.2652320},\n  shorttitle = {Low {{Power Wide Area Networks}}},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

In this paper, we propose a new methodology to design and analyze an urban traffic network control system by using the STPN. In addition, the applications of the STPN to eight-phase, six-phase, and two-phase traffic-light control systems are modularized. The advantage of the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the behaviors of traffic lights in terms of the conditions and events that cause phase alternations. Moreover, the size of the urban traffic network control system can be easily extended with our proposed modular technique. An analysis of the control models is performed via a reachability graph method to demonstrate how the models enforce the transitions of the traffic lights.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures.

SINR estimates have several important applications. These include optimizing the transmit power level for a target quality of service, assisting with handoff decisions and dynamically adapting the data rate for wireless Internet applications. Accurate SINR estimation provides for both a more efficient system and a higher user-perceived quality of service. In this paper, we develop new SINR estimators and compare their mean squared error (MSE) performance. We show that our new estimators dominate estimators that have previously appeared in the literature with respect to MSE. The sequence of transmitted bits in wireless communication systems consists of both pilot bits (which are known both to the transmitter and receiver) and user bits (which are known only by the transmitter). The SINR estimators we consider alternatively depend exclusively on pilot bits, exclusively on user bits, or simultaneously use both pilot and user bits. In addition, we consider estimators that utilize smoothing and feedback mechanisms. Smoothed estimators are motivated by the fact that the interference component of the SINR changes relatively slowly with time, typically with the addition or departure of a user to the system. Feedback estimators are motivated by the fact that receivers typically decode bits correctly with a very high probability, and therefore user bits can be thought of as quasipilot bits. For each estimator discussed, we derive an exact or approximate formula for its MSE. Satterthwaite approximations, noncentral F distributions (singly and doubly) and distribution theory of quadratic forms are the key statistical tools used in developing the MSE formulas. In the case of approximate MSE formulas, we validate their accuracy using simulation techniques. The approximate MSE formulas, of interest in their own right for comparing the quality of the estimators, are also used for optimally combining estimators. In particular, we derive optimal weights for linearly combining an estimator based on pilot bits with an estimator based on user bits. The optimal weights depend on the MSE of the two estimators being combined, and thus the accurate approximate MSE formulas can conveniently be used. The optimal weights also depend on the unknown SINR, and therefore need to be estimated in order to construct a useable combined estimator. The impact on the MSE of the combined estimator due to estimating the weights is examined. \\textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 51: 720\\textendash{}740, 2004.

Even the simplest objects will become ``smart'' because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  urldate = {2019-02-14},\n  date = {2017-03-01},\n  pages = {74-84},\n  author = {Aloi, G. and Caliciuri, G. and Fortino, G. and Gravina, R. and Pace, P. and Russo, W. and Savaglio, C.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/L6P8YIFR/Aloi et al_2017_Enabling IoT interoperability through opportunistic smartphone-based mobile.pdf;/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/5TGG2JID/S1084804516302405.html},\n  note = {00106}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":32,"created":1558988918646,"version":0,"updated":1559047884726},"$loki":683},{"itemID":4475,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{yacchiremavargas_smart_2016,\n  title = {Smart {{IoT Gateway For Heterogeneous Devices Interoperability}}},\n  volume = {14},\n  issn = {1548-0992},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7786378/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TLA.2016.7786378},\n  number = {8},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Latin America Transactions},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Latin Am.

Research has shown a substantial development of solutions for a wide range of devices and IoT platforms over the past 6-7 years. However, each solution provides its own IoT infrastructure, devices, APIs, and data formats leading to interoperability issues. Such interoperability issues are the consequence of many critical issues such as vendor lock-in, impossibility to develop IoT application exposing cross-platform, and/or cross-domain, difficulty in plugging non-interoperable IoT devices into different IoT platforms, and ultimately prevents the emergence of IoT technology at a large-scale. To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together. This paper performs a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IoT platforms. Also, the key challenges in this topic is presented.},\n  journaltitle = {Mobile Networks and Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Mobile Netw Appl},\n  urldate = {2019-02-14},\n  date = {2018-07-21},\n  author = {Noura, Mahda and Atiquzzaman, Mohammed and Gaedke, Martin},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/F6F7ZABB/Noura et al_2018_Interoperability in Internet of Things.pdf},\n  note = {00004}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":30,"created":1558989670216,"version":0,"updated":1559047884724},"$loki":692},{"itemID":4025,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{ochoa_large_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Limassol}},\n  title = {Large {{Scale LoRa Networks}}: {{From Homogeneous}} to {{Heterogeneous Deployments}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-6876-4},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8589080/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WiMOB.2018.8589080},\n  shorttitle = {Large {{Scale LoRa Networks}}},\n  abstract = {LoRa technology has emerged as an interesting solution for Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) applications. The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa configuration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the traffic intensity. The comparison shows the benefits of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its configuration according to its link budget.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 14th {{International Conference}} on {{Wireless}} and {{Mobile Computing}}, {{Networking}} and {{Communications}} ({{WiMob}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-04-30},\n  date = {2018-10},\n  pages = {192-199},\n  author = {Ochoa, Moises Nunez and Suraty, Luiz and Maman, Mickael and Duda, Andrzej},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/CN8P8U28/Ochoa et al. - 2018 - Large Scale LoRa Networks From Homogeneous to Het.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":30,"created":1558989670520,"version":0,"updated":1559047884918},"$loki":693},{"itemID":4474,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@collection{gravina_integration_2018,\n  location = {{Cham}},\n  title = {Integration, {{Interconnection}}, and {{Interoperability}} of {{IoT Systems}}},\n  isbn = {978-3-319-61299-7 978-3-319-61300-0},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-61300-0},\n  series = {Internet of {{Things}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-20},\n  date = {2018},\n  editor = {Gravina, Raffaele and Palau, Carlos E. and Manso, Marco and Liotta, Antonio and Fortino, Giancarlo},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-61300-0},\n  note = {00012}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":30,"created":1558989670768,"version":0,"updated":1559047885210},"$loki":694},{"itemID":4481,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@online{_interoperability_,\n  langid = {american},\n  title = {Interoperability in {{IoT}} | {{IGI Global}}},\n  url = {https://sci-hub.se/https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/chapter/224268},\n  urldate = {2019-05-20},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/Y7B87ZLF/224268.html},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":30,"created":1558989670786,"version":0,"updated":1559047885220},"$loki":695},{"itemID":4536,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{khanchuea_multiprotocol_2019,\n  location = {{Bangkok, Thailand}},\n  title = {A {{Multi}}-{{Protocol IoT Gateway}} and {{WiFi}}/{{BLE Sensor Nodes}} for {{Smart Home}} and {{Building Automation}}: {{Design}} and {{Implementation}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-72811-921-2},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8695968/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICTEmSys.2019.8695968},\n  shorttitle = {A {{Multi}}-{{Protocol IoT Gateway}} and {{WiFi}}/{{BLE Sensor Nodes}} for {{Smart Home}} and {{Building Automation}}},\n  eventtitle = {2019 10th {{International Conference}} of {{Information}} and {{Communication Technology}} for {{Embedded Systems}} ({{IC}}-{{ICTES}})},\n  booktitle = {2019 10th {{International Conference}} of {{Information}} and {{Communication Technology}} for {{Embedded Systems}} ({{IC}}-{{ICTES}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2019-03},\n  pages = {1-6},\n  author = {Khanchuea, Kanitkorn and Siripokarpirom, Rawat},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/P3YQ84SD/Khanchuea_Siripokarpirom_2019_A Multi-Protocol IoT Gateway and WiFi-BLE Sensor Nodes for Smart Home and.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":26,"created":1559026674462,"version":0,"updated":1559047885264},"$loki":700},{"itemID":4541,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{maiti_smart_2018,\n  title = {Smart {{Gateway}} Based {{Multi}}-Tier {{Service}}-{{Oriented Fog Computing Architecture}} for {{Achieving Ultra}}-{{Low Latency}}},\n  url = {http://dspace.nitrkl.ac.in:8080/dspace/handle/2080/3148},\n  abstract = {Services are part of our daily activities, such as the emergence of new solutions powered by cutting-edge technologies such as Fog Computing.

The IoT gateways play an important role in the IoT applications to bridge between sensor networks and the external environment through the Internet. Typically, the IoT gateways collect and send the data collected from sensors and actuators to external platforms where they will be remotely analyzed. However, the users desire a more adapted IoT gateway that can improve the IoT data privacy preservation before sending them to these external platforms. Thus, an IoT gateway that enables a better control over the set of private IoT resources and protects the collected personal data and their privacy is required. For this purpose, we propose a Semantic IoT Gateway that helps implement a dynamic and flexible privacy-preserving solution for the IoT domain. First, it enables to match between the data consumer's terms of service and the data owner's privacy preferences by generating an adapted privacy policy. Second, it converts the privacy policy into a custom smart contract. Finally, it connects a set of private IoT resources to a distributed network using the blockchain technology to host the generated smart contracts. A smart contract is an executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. Our proposal, which is highlighted through an example and experimentation on a real-world use-case, has given the expected results.},\n  booktitle = {On the {{Move}} to {{Meaningful Internet Systems}}. {{OTM}} 2018 {{Conferences}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer International Publishing}},\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {207-225},\n  author = {Loukil, Faiza and Ghedira-Guegan, Chirine and Boukadi, Khouloud and Benharkat, A\\\"icha Nabila},\n  editor = {Panetto, Herv\\'e and Debruyne, Christophe and Proper, Henderik A. and Ardagna, Claudio Agostino and Roman, Dumitru and Meersman, Robert},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/Aghiles/Redaction/setup/lib/res_IoT/storage/W3ZCMLKK/Loukil et al. - 2018 - Semantic IoT Gateway Towards Automated Generation.pdf},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-02610-3_12},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":5,"created":1559029940526,"version":0,"updated":1559047885280},"$loki":728},{"itemID":4552,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{venkatesan_design_2017,\n  location = {{Palladam, Tamilnadu, India}},\n  title = {Design of a Smart Gateway Solution Based on the Exploration of Specific Challenges in {{IoT}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5090-3242-6 978-1-5090-3243-3},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8058352/},\n  doi = {10.1109/I-SMAC.2017.8058352},\n  eventtitle = {2017 {{International Conference}} on {{I}}-{{SMAC}} ({{IoT}} in {{Social}}, {{Mobile}}, {{Analytics}} and {{Cloud}}) ({{I}}-{{SMAC}})},\n  booktitle = {2017 {{International Conference}} on {{I}}-{{SMAC}} ({{IoT}} in {{Social}}, {{Mobile}}, {{Analytics}} and {{Cloud}}) ({{I}}-{{SMAC}})},\n  publisher = IEEE,\n  urldate = {2019-05-28},\n  date = {2017-02},\n  pages = {22-31},\n  author = {Venkatesan, V.
