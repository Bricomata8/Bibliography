3rd issue: finding the information
you need
q Searching for information is a tough issue
q Web search engine: Google,…

q Most IoT clouds uses HTTP request (GET, POST,
PUT, …) to push/store data to web
platforms/servers
q If you need an information, for instance the
temperature in room A of HiveColab in
Kampala, then you have to go to the right web
page
q When there can be millions of IoT
nodes providing large variety of data,
it is difficult to find your way!
27

From search for info to get the info
q Use the PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE model

q Use broker nodes to manage topics

4th issue: make it simpler?

q End-users are not necessarily computer science
experts nor high-skilled programmers
q Use graphical tools to build data processing
flows, allowing intuivive connection from data
producers to data consumers

31

Node-Red
q Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring
together hardware devices, APIs and online
services, e.g. clouds of various types
q provides a browser-based flow editor to wire
together flows with a wide range of nodes

32

Node-red enabled IoT gateway
q Messages received on the IoT gateway can be
injected into a Node-Red flow, allowing complex
data processing to be defined

The IoT BackOffice

IoT usually means

36

But also how to analyse the data
q What is the meaning of the collected data?
q Example with farming
q What is interesting for farmers?
• Fertility detection
• Eating/Ruminating time for welfare

q What data can be easily obtained?
• accelerometer data with neck-mounted collar

q How to detect relevant event from these data?
Advanced data analysis
Need of experts from the
domain!

37

Analysis techniques
q Traditional statistic methods still valid, and useful!

¡

Definition
Grouping unlabeled data into clusters, for the purpose of
inference of hidden structures or information

¡

Dissimilarity measurement
§ Distance : Euclidean(L2), Manhattan(L1), …
§ Angle : Inner product, …
§ Non-metric : Rank, Intensity, …

¡

Types of Clustering
§ Hierarchical
▪ Agglomerative or divisive

§ Partitioning
▪ K-means, VQ, MDS, …

Use the full power of the Internet!

q IoT data are pushed on
Internet data clouds
q Computing resources
using Virtual Machines are
obtained from Internet
Computing clouds
