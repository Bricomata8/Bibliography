according to the requirement of the user, this has been reduced
to the problem of multi attribute decision making (MADM)

purview of the mobile terminal. The selection criterion involves
multiple attributes. Although many ranking algorithms have
been proposed, there is a need to lay a stress on the user
requirements and the terminal power consumption. In this paper
we propose a ranking algorithm keeping in view the user

presence of a weight matrlx. Several MADM

algorithms have been proposed namely TOPSIS, SAW, AHP,

Hence a ranking algorithm which can remove these

preferences and the application priorities. Having a close
proximity with TOPSIS algorithm, the idea proposed overcomes
the ranking abnormalities and scores high on efficiency.

III. DECISION M\AKING CRITERIA
The attributes used for the selection algorithm use the
same criteria that have been used in [5] for TOPSIS procedure.
However there was a need felt for considering another criteria
for the selection process. The attributes used are below.
Cost Per Byte: This the amount charged by the network
operator to which the user is subscribed or the operator whose
services are in use. (Includes the roaming arrangements).
Total Bandwidth: It is the overall bandwidth available over
the link accessed by the mobile terminal. It is measured in
terms of bps (bits per second).
Available Bandwidth: This is the measure of per user
bandwidth allotted by the network operator which is dynamic

measured in terms of bps (bits per second).
Delay: The packet delay gives the measure in milliseconds of
the average delay for the packet on the wireless link.
Jitter: It is the delay variations (average) on the wireless link
of the network. It is measured in milliseconds.
Packet Loss: It is the measure of average packet loss between
the mobile terminal and the network operator. It is measured
for every 1 million packets sent.
Signal Strength: It is the measure of signal strength available
to the mobile terminal from the base station of the network.
This was the basis of traditional handoff procedures. It is
measured in terms of dB-micro volts per meter (dBptV/m)
Utilization: It is the percentage of utilization of the wireless
link of the network used.
Terminal Power Consumption is one of the vital criteria to
be considered for access of the network. For a mobile terminal
having a low battery power, the optimum network must not
only satisfy the QOS factors but also should give due
importance to the battery power available at that point of time.
For a mobile with low batter power, the network with high
signal strength, moderate quality and cost may prove to be
more efficient than the network with best quality, low cost but
low signal strength.

each application varies, it is essential to consider only those
networks for the second phase which have substantial data
rates that can support the type of application. Also, as the
battery power and the processor speed play an important role
for the network to be selected they are compared with the
signal available networks at that moment to eliminate those
from consideration which are far less compatible with the
terminal power consumption

The application profile contains the type of application, the

the current capacity of the terminal in terms of power usage
and can be used to set the cut off limit for signal strengths (in
fact we set the lower bound based on the battery power at the
moment of the terminal and also under the assumption that
maximum battery power will be used).

applied in many research areas. Coming to the application of
these algorithms for network selection, it has been found that
TOPSIS is one of the most preferred one compared to others.
It is proved that TOPSIS can change when a candidate at the
bottom of the ranking is removed from the comparison, and
the iterative approach gives a more consistent and accurate
final result. Terminal Power Consumption and User
preferences are not given due importance of the available
procedures. The algorithm proposed overcomes the above
abnormalities and scores high on efficiency by consuming less
memory and at an optimum processor speed.

MIADM algorithm is said to be ideal if the removal of the
bottom ranked candidate does not alter the ranking. However,
TOPSIS algorithm did not meet this requirement and so
iterative TOPSIS was proposed in [5].
For each of the attributes namely Cost, Delay, Jitter, Loss
and utilization the affect of removal of bottom ranked network
will either increase or decrease the median. In either of the
cases the difference (Median - Attribute value of weighted
normalized matrix) would vary respectively. However as we
subtract from a common term the order for the each of column
will remain the same (in the delta matrix). The same would be
the case in case of the attributes Total bandwidth and available
bandwidth (where the delta matrix attribute being Attribute
