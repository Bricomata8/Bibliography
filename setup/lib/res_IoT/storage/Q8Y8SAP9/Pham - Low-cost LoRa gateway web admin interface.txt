q This tutorial presents the web admin interface
which is an add-on to the low-cost gateway
q Please read first the Low-cost LoRa gateway:
a step-by-step tutorial to understand the
gateway configuration and architecture
q Note that the SD card image has everything
needed, including the web admin interface
installed, so you may skip the installation
procedure if you flashed the SD card image
q Let’s get started…

or not

13

Gateway update
q Your gateway must be updated to the latest
version
q Internet access for the gateway is necessary
q The update procedure can easily be done with
the web admin interface, connect to the
gateway WiFi first
q The update steps are

Gateway WAZIUP cloud
q Configuring WAZIUP cloud
The WAZIUP cloud tab is only available when
key_WAZIUP.py is found

WAZIUP cloud uses FIWARE
platform with the possibility to define
domains. The domain will be
defined as project_name+''+organization_name+service_tree,
e.g. waziup-UPPA-TESTS if:
- project_name is waziup,
- organization_name is UPPA,
- service_tree is –TESTS
service_tree can be empty
otherwise it must begin with a '-'.

The device id will be
organization_name+service_tr
ee+"_Sensor"+device_addr.
For instance, for sensor 2
hosted by UPPA: UPPATESTS_Sensor2.
Username and password of
the WAZIUP account. If
username is "guest" then all
data will be public

19

Gateway system
configuration (1)
q Gateway WiFi access point
Set the gateway's access point
SSID (should normally be preconfigured, see Update section)
Also allow to define/change the
WiFi access point password

Default SSID is
If you indicate a customized
SSID, it will be preserved when
the gateway is updated.

WAZIUP_PI_GW_XXXXXXXXXX with

the last 5 bytes of the gateway
network interface (e.g. 27EB84C456)
If you want to get back to the default
SSID, just copy/paste from here

Gateway system
configuration (2)
q Configure as WiFi client
Configure the gateway as WiFi
client to connect to an existing WiFi
network. Changes will take effect
after reboot.

Warning: if a valid WiFi network is
not configured you will not be able
to connect through the gateway's
access point anymore. If that
happens, use wired Ethernet to
switch back to access point mode.
