Abstract–The predominant objective of next-generation
networks (i.e. 4G) is to support high bandwidth with high
mobility. 3G technologies provide low bandwidth at a cellular
level, and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) supports much
higher bandwidth at a local level. The two types of technologies
will be seamlessly integrated in 4G networks. In this paper, we
present an efficient network selection mechanism for nextgeneration networks to guarantee mobile users being always best
connected (ABC). Two mathematical techniques are combined in
the mechanism to decide the optimum network for mobile users
through finding the tradeoff among user’s preference, service
application, and network condition.
Keywords-4G networks; network selection; quality of service

I. INTRODUCTION
One
primary
characteristic
of
next-generation
communication systems (i.e. 4G) will be a composite
communication model, where various access systems such as
cellular, satellite, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and
even wired networks will be combined to provide an optimum
service at any time from any where. One of the popular
heterogeneous systems discussed in recent literature is the
integration of the WLAN and cellular 3G systems. Cellular
networks such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS),
Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), and
cdma2000 support low bandwidth over a wide geographical
area. While WLAN, based on IEEE 802.11 and HiperLAN/2
standards, can provide relatively high bandwidth (up to 54
Mbps) in a small coverage of a few thousand square meters
around a single access point. As a result, the integration of the
WLAN and cellular systems can efficiently achieve the
required capacity and QoS level. In a heterogeneous system, a
dynamical network selection mechanism has to be developed
to decide an appropriate radio access technology for a specific
service.
Three main types of network selection methods have been
proposed for the heterogeneous systems. In the traditional
methods such as [1], only the radio signal strength (RSS)
threshold and hysteresis values are considered and processed in
a fuzzy logic based algorithm. However, with a vision of multinetwork environment and universal access, the traditional
algorithm is not sufficient to make a handoff decision, as they
do not take into account the current context or user’s
preference. When more handoff decision factors are
considered, a number of two-dimension cost functions such as
[2], are developed. In one dimension, the function reflects the
types of services requested by the user, while in the second

0-7803-8938-7/05/$20.00 (C) 2005 IEEE

dimension, it represents the cost to the network according to
specific parameters. [3] optimizes the cost function-based
algorithm by separating cost function factors into three
different categories: QoS factors, weighting factors, and
network priority factors. QoS factors are defined based on the
user- and network-specific requirements. The weight factors
reflect the dominances of the particular requirements with
respect to the user. The network priority factors present the
abilities of the networks that fulfill the requirements. In this
paper, we propose a network selection mechanism that belongs
to the last type of method.
In order to assure required QoS for various applications and
meanwhile avoid frequent handoffs in the heterogeneous
systems, we integrates the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
and the grey relational analysis (GRA) into the network
selection algorithm to decide the best network for mobile users.
AHP [4] is a mathematical-based technology to analyze
complex problems and assist in finding the best solution by
synthesizing all deciding factors. AHP has already been
applied to a number of areas, such as predicting economic
outcomes [5] and resolving conflicts [6]. GRA was introduced
in [7] to analyze the relational grade for several discrete
sequences and select the best sequence. The technique is
largely adopted in project selection [8] and factor effect
evaluation [9].
In this paper, keeping mobile users always best connected
(ABC) [10] is considered as design goal, and QoS
characteristics in matter of user’s preference, service
application and network condition are adopted as decision
factors. AHP is responsible to derive the weights of QoS
parameters based on user’s preference and service application.
GRA takes charge of ranking the network alternatives through
faster and simpler calculations. UMTS and WLAN are
considered as network alternatives in this paper.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II and
Section III introduce AHP and GRA, respectively. Section IV
presents the proposed network selection algorithm. Section V
contains some simulation results conducted in a simple
topology. Section VI presents the conclusions and further
research.
II. ANALITIC HIERARCHY PROCESS
AHP is a means of decomposing a complicated problem into
a hierarchy of simpler and more manageable subproblems.
These subproblems are usually called decision factors and
weighted according to their relative dominances to the
problem. The bottom decision factors are actually the solution

1418

alternatives. AHP selects the solution alternative with the
largest synthesized weight. AHP performs following four main
steps: decomposition, pairwise comparison, local weight
calculation, and weight synthesis.
Structuring a problem as a hierarchy of multiple criteria is
the first step of implementing AHP. The decision factors of the
problem are identified and inserted into the hierarchy. The
overall objective is placed at the topmost node of the hierarchy.
The subsequent nodes present the decision factors. The
solution alternatives are located at the bottom nodes. For
instance, John is trying to make a selection among three new
houses A, B, and C. His preferences are location, price and
space. The hierarchy on “choosing a house” is established as
shown in Fig. 1.

be true. Thus, the weight vector equals V and the number of
elements becomes the corresponding x. As a result, the weights
of the decision factors can be achieved by calculating the
eigenvector of AHP matrix and the eigenvalue that
approximately equals the number of assessed elements [6].
However, people’s assessments are not entirely consistent.
The judgment errors can be detected by calculating a
consistency index (CI).

CI = (x max − n ) (n − 1)

(2)
where xmax is the eigenvalue. This CI is then divided by a
random index (RI), which is the average CI of a randomly
generated reciprocal matrix as described in Table I [6]. CI/RI is
called the consistency ratio (CR). [6] suggests that judgment
errors are tolerable if CR ≤ 10% .
In the last step, the overall weights of the factors are
achieved by computing the product of the local weights from
each level.
III. GREY RELATIONAL ANALYSIS

House C

The second step is the evaluation stage where each factor is
compared to all other factors within the same parent. The
comparison results within each parent are presented in a square
matrix, as shown in Fig. 2. The pairwise comparisons are
finished through answering the question “Which of the two is
more important?” and, second, “By how much?” A
fundamental 1 to 9 scale is used in AHP to allow the decision
maker to express the strength of preference based on his
intuition, experience, and knowledge. The numbers from 1 to 9
are used to respectively present equally, weakly moderately,
moderately, moderately plus, strongly, strongly plus, very
strongly, very very strongly, and extremely important to the
objective. The smaller one in a pair is chosen as a unit and the
larger one is estimated as a multiple of that unit and assigned a
number based on the perceived intensity of importance.
Similarly, the reciprocals of these numbers are used to show
the inverted comparison results. We thus obtain a reciprocal
matrix where the entries are symmetric with respect to the
diagonal.
For a reciprocal n × n matrix M, there exits an eigenvalue
equation MV = xV , where V is non-zero vector called
eigenvector, and x is a scalar called eigenvalue. V and x appear
as a pair and cannot be taken apart. When M is consistent, it
can be easily deduced that m ij = m ik m kj (i, j, k = 1,2,…n).
Since each element in the AHP matrix is the ratio of the weight
of one decision factor to another with respect to their parents,
we can denote M as
m11 m12 m1n   w1 w1 w1 w 2 w1 w n 

number of decision factors. If all wi is constructed into a
weight matrix (W)T=[w1 w2 … wn], MW=nW can be proved to

GRA is an effective method to analyze the relationship
grade for discrete sequences. One of the sequences is defined
as reference sequence presenting the idea situation. The grey
relationship between the reference sequence and other
sequences can be achieved by calculating grey relational
coefficient (GRC) according to the level of similarity and
variability. The sequence with the largest GRC is the most
desirable one. GRA is usually implemented following three
steps: normalizing data, defining the ideal sequence, and
computing GRC [7].

Given n sequences (X1, X2…, Xn) are compared, and each
sequence has k elements, i.e., X i = (x i (1), x i (2), … x i (k )) where
i = 1, 2... n. The normalization of the sequence data is
performed according to three situations (larger-the-better,
smaller-the-better, and nominal-the-best) as follows:
xi ( j ) − l j
(3)
x i* ( j ) =
u j −lj
x i* ( j ) =

l j = min{x1 ( j ), x 2 ( j ), … x n ( j )} , mj is the target value in the

sequence (X0) is defined to contain the upper bound, lower
bound, or moderate bound respectively in larger-the-better,
smaller-the-better or nominal-the-better situations. The GRC
can be then calculated as following:

The network selection mechanism is divided into three main
logical function blocks: collecting data, processing data and
making decision, as shown in Fig. 3. It is noted that the
availability of WLAN has to be detected before collecting data
because WLAN usually has relatively small coverage. If RSS
from the WLAN is stale enough for communications service
and the user would not leave WLAN soon, the network
selection mechanism begins to collect other QoS parameters. If
either of the requirements fails to be fulfilled, UMTS is
directly selected through assigning the GRCs of the network
alternatives.
Two types of data (user’s preferences and network
conditions) in the matter of QoS parameters are collected.
User-based data are processed by AHP to derive the global
weights (GW) of second-level factors and local weights (LW1,

IV. NETWORK SELECTION SCHEME USING AHP AND GRA
In this section, we define the network selection decision
factors and present how AHP and GRA cooperate to determine
the best available network for the user.
For the purpose of supporting best possible QoS, we
consider as many QoS factors as possible. The factors are
constructed into an AHP hierarchy based on their relationships.
QoS is placed in the topmost level of the hierarchy as the
objective. The main QoS factors that describe network
condition are defined as availability, throughput (α), timeliness
(β), reliability (γ), security (δ), cost (ε), which are in the second
level of the hierarchy. In order to make decision correctly and
efficiently, we decompose the general element timeliness into
delay (ζ), response time (η), and jitter (θ), and separate
reliability into BER (λ), burst error (µ), average number of
retransmissions per packet (ν), and packet loss ratio (σ). These
sub-factors are arranged in the third level. Additionally, we
adopt received signal strength (RSS) and coverage area as subfactors determining availability to avoid frequent handoffs for
high-speed users. Finally, we consider UMTS and WLAN as

of
third-level
factors.
If
GW = {wα , wβ , wγ , wδ , wε , wκ } , LW1 = {wζ , wη , wθ } and
LW2 = {wλ , wµ , wν , wσ } , the final weights of all factors are

weights,

The network-based data are normalized by GRA according to
two situations: larger-the-better and smaller-the-better. It is
derived that ∆ max = 1 and ∆ min = 0 when the nominal-the-best
situation dose not exist. Additionally, the ideal network
conditions are presented by a series of 1s after normalization.
Then, the GRC is expressed as:

where xUMTS
/ WLAN ( p ) is the normalization of the UMTS data or

is more desirable.

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In the simulation, we consider an area in which there are
three WLAN APs (referred to as AP-1, AP-2, AP-3) and a
UMTS BS, as shown in Fig. 4. We assume that the coverage
(diameters) of the APs and BS are 200m and 1000m
respectively. Distance from AP-2 to AP-1 and AP-3 are
respectively 400m and 100m. The conditions of the networks
are shown in Table II. In the simulation scenario, a mobile
user, who is transferring a file, moves anticlockwise at 1m/s
from the BS to AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and then backs to the
starting point.

factors, weighting factors, and network priority factors to select
the best network for mobile user. AHP was adopted to achieve
weighting factors and GRE was utilized to prioritize the
networks. The simulation results revealed that the proposed
mechanism can not only work efficiently for an UMTS/WLAN
system but also reduce the complexity of implementation
significantly.

The network-based data are normalized according to four
possible network selection scenarios including UMTS vs.
WLAN-1; UMTS vs. WLAN-2; UMTS vs. WLAN-2 vs.
WLAN-3; and UMTS vs. WLAN-3, as shown in Table III.
User’s preference on QoS factors and subfactors are defined in
Table IV and V. The network selection results are shown in
Fig. 5.
During the normalizations, it is observed that 1s are directly
assigned to the upper bounds in larger-the-better situations and
the lower bounds in smaller-the-better situations when there
are only two network alternatives. Other entries in the table are
set to 0s. The time on achieving the exact QoS values and
normalizing them presented in [3] are significantly reduced.
Additionally, it is noted that the mobile user selects highthroughput-and-high-reliability WLAN_3, when UMTS,
WLAN_2 and WLAN_3 are simultaneously available.
However, the selection result would change if the user changes
his preference as shown in Fig. 6, where the vertical axis
presents the weights of the factors and the horizontal axis
presents the difference between the GRCs calculated for
WLAN-2 and WLAN-3. WLAN-2 is selected if the horizontal
value is positive. This example shows that when the weight of
cost increases, lower-cost WLAN-2 is selected instead of
WLAN-3. It illustrates that the network selection mechanism is
actually a process of balancing user preference, service
application and network condition.

algorithm for next generation networks. We integrated QoS
