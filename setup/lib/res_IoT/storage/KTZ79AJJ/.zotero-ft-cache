Official stance (headlines, videos, interviews) from the C-ITS community (BigAuto, New Players, OEMs, …)

Our primary motivations for autonomous vehicles (AVs) are Safety and Efficiency

 Safety
Smaller number of accidents and fatalities ► ≈ 1/10
antagonistic goals [Ex.: 1 fatality per day rather than 9 (France)]

 Efficiency
Small inter-vehicular gaps at high velocities (reduce travel times, energy consumption, …), optimal use of asphalt resources

WAVE 1.0

 WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment):
unique technology for V2I and V2V radio telecoms * “Co-operative” Awareness Messages (CAMs ≡ beacons) * Decentralized Environmental Notification Messages (DENMs) * Unacknowledged broadcast mode (no co-operation!)
 Periodic Beaconing + Local Dynamic Maps

IEEE 802.11p , ETSI ITS G5 standards for connected automated vehicles ≈ 2010

WAVE: omnidirectional wifi (5.9 GHz, 6 Mbits/s, radius ≈ 300-500 m)

V2I: vehicle-to-infrastructure for infotainment

V2V: vehicle-to-vehicle for safety (supposedly)

1) WAVE Protocols

 CCH: the only radio channel (among 7) for beacons and DENM messages

 Unbounded delays  Unbounded message losses

?? Safety ≡ hard real-time (< 30 ms)
+ ultra high reliability

** CSMA-CA MAC protocol **

* random back-off * average delays in heavy
traffic ≈ 200 ms

Inappropriate for safety/efficiency

2) Periodic Beaconing + LDMs
Timestamped beacons (CAMs) carry GNSS geodata + velocity + … are
broadcasted periodically (1 to 10 Hz) ►local dynamic maps (diameter ≈ 0.6-1 km)

 Inaccurate GNSS geodata? Different inaccuracies for different vehicles?

 Malicious vehicles may lie (false GNSS geodata)

 LDM: concurrent reads/writes  Undelivered beacons (losses)

Inconsistency ∀{X, Y} LDMX ≠ LDMY

Beaconing? Useless % safety. Harmful % « pollution »

Considered OK by C-ITS community

Safety-critical functions: proba (success) ≈ 1-10-6 / hour (ISO 26262)
Small inter-vehicular gaps? Rely on onboard robotics!

Instantiations in CAVs
Mode « cyber-stealth » (Vital, N2N, F2F coms only, no V2I coms*)
* Handled by NSC subsystems (e.g., eCall, randomized Bcasts (contribution to traffic data), filtered imports by SC subsystems,…)

Mode « no internal cybersurveillance »

Both compatible with anti-theft, accountability/auditability and legitimate cyber-surveillance

Which future motorized society do we want?
Vulnerable to eavesdropping, tracking and cyberattacks. Fees/billing for V2I coms and PKI.
Safety not (much) better than achieved with OB robotics.
No cyber-espionnage/tracking (options), no remote cyberattacks. Invulnerability to nearby cyberattacks (irrational, detected). No charges for N2N coms, for PKI, ≈ 0 for V2I coms. Highest safety.

► MAC protocols
► Collision-free TDMA % ranking in cohorts (pub. 2016) ► Deterministic CDMA ► CSMA & deterministic collision resolution
► Optical N2N (passive) communications
