Low-power and longrange?!
Energy

Enhanced from M. Dohler “M2M in SmartCities”

Increasing range?!
q Generally, robustness and sensitivity can be
increased when transmitting (much) slower
q A[Sigfox message is sent relatively slowly in a
very narrow band of spectrum (hence ultranarrow-band) using Gaussian Frequency-Shift
Keying modulation]. Max throughput=~100bps
q LoRa also increases time-on-air when maximum
range is needed. But LoRa uses spread spectrum
instead of UNB.
300bps-37.5kbps

q Africa's countries are still far from being ready to
enjoy the smallest benefit of IoT
q lack of infrastructure
q high cost of hardware
q complexity in deployment
q lack of technological eco-system and background

q to deploy IoT in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is
necessary to target three major issues
q reduce cost of infrastructures, hardware and services
q limit dependancy to proprietary infrastructures and
provide local interaction models
q target technology appropriation, push for local
business models

Added-value!

Involving innovation
hubs/stakeholders!
• Close to dev & entrepreneurs communities
• Have their own community and com channels (community
builders & catalysts)
• Used to organizing disruptive events
• On the field (know the targets personaly & the market)
• Used to empowering startups & businesses
(coaching, business dev, incubation, acceleration…)
• Affiliated to international networks that could be involved in
dissemination or Business dev (Afrilabs)

Low-cost LoRa IoT devices and gateway FAQ
1)

What is Internet-of-Thing (IoT)?
From IERC (European Research Cluster on the Internet of Thing)
The IERC definition states that IoT is "A dynamic global network infrastructure with
self-configuring capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication
protocols where physical and virtual “things” have identities, physical attributes, and
virtual personalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated
into the information network."
From http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/internet-of-things/

Tutorial on hardware &
software for low-cost longrange IoT!

"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects that contain
embedded technology to communicate and sense or interact with their internal
states or the external environment."
From http://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/Internet-of-Things-IoT
"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices,
mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with
unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring
human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction."

What is WAZIUP?
The EU H2020 WAZIUP project, namely the Open Innovation Platform for IoT-Big
Data in Sub-Saharan Africa is a collaborative research project using cutting edge
technology applying IoT and Big Data to improve the working conditions in the rural
ecosystem of Sub-Saharan Africa. First, WAZIUP operates by involving farmers and
breeders in order to define the platform specifications in focused validation cases.
Second, while tackling challenges which are specific to the rural ecosystem, it also
engages the flourishing ICT ecosystem in those countries by fostering new tools
and good practices, entrepreneurship and start-ups. Aimed at boosting the ICT
sector, WAZIUP proposes solutions aiming at long term sustainability.
WAZIUP will deliver a communication and big data application platform and
generate locally the know how by training by use case and examples. The use of
standards will help to create an interoperable platform, fully open source, oriented
to radically new paradigms for innovative application/services delivery. WAZIUP is
driven by the following visions:

1. Empower the African Rural Economy. Develop new technological enablers to
empower the African rural economy now threatened by the concurrent action
of rapid urbanization and of climate change. WAZIUP technologies can
support the necessary services and infrastructures to launch agriculture and
