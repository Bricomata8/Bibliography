Why it worked
•Machine-learning algorithms have progressed in recent years, especially through the
development of deep learning and reinforcement-learning techniques based on neural
networks.
•Computing capacity has become available to train larger and more complex models much
faster. Graphics processing units (GPUs), originally designed to render the computer
graphics in video games, have been repurposed to execute the data and algorithm crunching
required for machine learning at speeds many times faster than traditional processor chips.
Key Trend Emerging: Specially design chips and Hardware for Machine Learning workloads
(Tensor Units).
•Massive amounts of data that can be used to train Machine Learning models are being
generated, for example through daily creation of billions of images, online click streams,
voice and video, mobile locations, and sensors embedded in the Internet of Things devices.
Be careful: we will still need experts and not just data scientists. Ten Million uninformed
opinions are not as good as one expert opinion!

ETSI Standards Initiative : New ETSI group on improving Operator Experience using
Artificial Intelligence
February 2017: ETSI announces the creation of the Industry Specification Group 'Experiential Network Intelligence' (ISG
ENI).
The purpose of the group is to define a Cognitive Network Management architecture that is based on the “observe-orientdecide-act” control model. It uses AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques and context-aware policies to adjust offered services
based on changes in user needs, environmental conditions and business goals.
The system is experiential, in that it learns from its operation and from decisions given to it by operators to improve its
knowledge of how to act in the future. This will help operators automate their network configuration and monitoring processes,
thereby reducing their operational expenditure and improving the use and maintenance of their networks.
“The unique added value of the ETSI ISG ENI approach is to define new metrics to quantify the operator’s experience; this
enables the optimization and adjustment of the operator’s experience over time, taking advantage of machine learning and
reasoning.” (ETSI ISG ENI Initiative Group Leader )

User Cell Association


Each user has to choose the best SBS among its options.



After selection it will receive a reward based on congestion level of
the SBS and the channel gain between itself and the SBS.



Each user try to solve an optimal control problem for selecting the

SBS over the time.


Network is ultra-dense so we model it using mean field games.

Transforming MFG to MDP







Solving the mean-field game depends on the form of the utility function which
restricts the application domain of MFG
Given that the MFG problem is difficult to solve, we transform MFG problem into a
Markov decision process (MDP).
For solving MDP, we use deep reinforcement learning.
Users approximate the value function using adaptive linear neuron (ADALINE) neural
networks. The user then trains its network using Widrow-Hoff algorithm (exploration)
with the probability 𝜖 and chooses the best BS with probability 1 − 𝜖.

We have a system with 10 SBSs in equilibrium. (part1)



20 imitator users and 20 non-imitator users enter the system and start
to learn the environment. (part2)



Imitator users can learn the environment faster than non-imitator

users.


Imitator users use experience of the existing users in the system.
