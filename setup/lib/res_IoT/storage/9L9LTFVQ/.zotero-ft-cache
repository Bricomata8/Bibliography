ABSTRACT
In this paper we present a simple, stochastic-geometric model of a wireless access network exploiting the LoRA (Long Range) protocol, which is a non-expensive technology allowing for long-range, single-hop connectivity for the Internet of ings. We assume a space-time Poisson model of packets transmi ed by LoRA nodes to a xed base station. Following previous studies of the impact of interference [8, 10], we assume that a given packet is successfully received when no interfering packet arrives with similar power before the given packet payload phase. is is as a consequence of LoRa using di erent transmission rates for di erent link budgets (transmissions with smaller received powers use larger spreading factors) and LoRa intra-technology interference treatment. Using our model, we study the scaling of the packet reception probabilities per link budget as a function of the spatial density of nodes and their rate of transmissions. We consider both the parameter values recommended by the LoRa provider, as well as proposing LoRa tuning to improve the equality of performance for all link budgets. We also consider spatially non-homogeneous distributions of LoRa nodes. We show also how a fair comparison to non-slo ed Aloha can be made within the same framework.

1 INTRODUCTION
Low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the development of the Internet of ings. ey are wireless cellular networks that, in contrast to LTE (and also WiFi and Bluetooth), do not focus on high data rate communications. e goal of LPWANs is to ensure large coverage areas with reasonable data rates and low energy consumption. A good scaling in terms of the density of nodes is also a key requirement for these systems.
Several systems in the eld of LPWANs exist. Essentially, four options are available to customers: Sigfox, operator standards LTEM or NB-IoT, and several proprietary solutions, LoRa (Long Range) being one of them. Sigfox is o ered as an operator service and the technology is proprietary. It operates in the 968/902 MHz licencefree industrial scienti c and medical (ISM) radio band. Sigfox acts as both the technology and the service provider and has quickly deployed a large number of base stations in Europe and beyond. Long Term Evolution Machine-to-Machine LTE-M and Narrow Band-IoT are the standards promoted by the traditional telecom operators

that expect to propose solutions for machine-to-machine tra c through standardized solutions, in particular in the framework of the forthcoming 5G systems. ere is a signi cant number of proprietary solutions such as Accelus, Cyan’s Cynet, Ingenu/On-Ramp, SilverSpring Star sh, etc., but only a limited amount of information about these systems is available.
LoRa is also a proprietary technology developed by Cycleo of Grenoble, France, and acquired by Semtech in 2012. As its name suggests, it mainly aims at long range transmissions with a high robustness, multipath and Doppler resistance, and low power. LoRa networks o en operate in the unlicensed ISM band (434 MHz and 868 MHz in Europe and 433 MHz and 915 MHz in the USA), but can also use licensed bands in the spectrum ranging from 137 to 1020 MHz. LoRa uses a kind of Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) with Forward Error Correction (FEC), where wideband linear frequency modulated chirp pulses are used to encode information and the spreading factor is directly linked to the power decay between the end device and the base station.
We decided to focus our study on LoRa systems because, even though it is a proprietary technology, a signi cant amount of information is available on it, see Section 3, making it possible to model and study LoRa networks. Moreover, LoRa industrial momentum seems to be signi cant and commercial success for LoRa is likely.
LoRa technology has already been studied, both for the evaluation of pairs of simultaneous transmissions [10] and for the scaling evaluation of a large network [11], [8]. However, to the authors’ best knowledge, there is no commonly accepted analytical model of LoRa networks. A major di culty in addressing performances of LoRa consists in its multiparameter nature, with a crucial rule played by the spreading factors and, closely related to them, packet transmission time. An additional di culty is the complexity of the signal-to-interference analysis of packet reception in CSS technology.
In this paper we propose a mathematical model allowing one to calculate packet reception probabilities per link budget, according to the spatial density of nodes and their rate of transmissions, as well as all main LoRa parameters. It is based on a Poisson rain (space-time) model of packet transmissions from the nodes to the base station (gateway). is model has already been used in [5, 6] to study non-slo ed Aloha system.
e remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present some related studies, which are crucial to our approach. In Section 3 we present LoRa system assumptions and in Section 4 we present our model with its analysis. Section 5 presents numerical results. In Section 6 we brie y sketch how LoRa can

be compared to non-slo ed Aloha using a Poisson rain model of packet transmissions. Finally, Section 7 concludes the article.

establish packet collision rules, which are reproduced next in a

3 LORA SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND ASSUMPTIONS
LoRa systems are highly parameterizable. e carrier frequency can be chosen from 137 to 1020 MHz by steps of 61 kHz and the bandwidth (the width of frequencies in the radio band) can be set to 125 MHz, 250 MHz or 500 MHz. LoRa can use transmission powers from -4 dBm to 20 dBm.
A key parameter of LoRa is the spreading factor, which is the ratio between the symbol rate and the chip rate. Denoted in what follows by SF, and expressed at the logarithmic scale at base 2 (thus the increase by 1 of the SF multiplies the chip per symbol rate by 2), the SF of LoRa varies from 6 to 12. With SF = 6 the symbol rate is the highest but the transmission is the least robust. e value of SF is xed for individual transmissions depending on the received power, as explained in Section 3.1.
e physical layer of LoRa also incorporates Forward Error Correction (FEC) that permits the recovery of bits of information in the case of corruption by interference. is requires a small overhead of additional encoding of the data in the transmi ed packet thus reducing the Coding Rate (CR). e available values of CR are 4/5, 5/6, 4/7, 4/8 (with smaller values providing more reliability).

For example, when the signal is received with at least −121 dBm of power then the spreading factor is set to its minimal value SF = 6. When the received power is in the interval [−124, −121) then SF = 7, etc. e smallest acceptable received power −137 dBm triggers SF = 12.
3.2 Collision model
A precise (signal to interference) analysis of the reception of packets in LoRa chirp spread spectrum systems is complicated. We will use a simpli ed collision model, to this end, inspired by the results presented in [8] and [10]. e rst assumption we make is that two transmissions using di erent values of SF do not interfere with each other; this assumption is retained in the collision model described in [8]. In other words, the codes with di erent spreading factors are assumed orthogonal.
e second assumption concerns collisions caused by simultaneous transmissions using the same value of SF. Di erent cases of this, identi ed in [10], depend on the time overlap of the (two or more) simultaneous transmissions and their received powers, called also Received Signal Strength Indications (RSSIs). More speci cally, [10] distinguishes ve cases of possible overlap of the transmission period of a given packet with an interfering transmission, presented in Figure 1, combined with two cases regarding the di erence between their RSSI values. It shows that the given packet is always successfully received if its RSSI is signi cantly greater than that of the interfering packet or, in the case of similar RSSI values, when the interfering transmission starts relatively late, precisely during

An additional advantage of relating the spreading factors to

it inversely related to the received power: higher received power di erent spreading factors and thus, according to the assumption

allows one to use a smaller spreading factor and thus reduce the packet transmission time, as speci ed in Section 3.3. As an example, Table 1 gives the values of SF proposed in [2] for di erent thresholds

made above, will not interfere. Consequently, we can assume that
a given packet is successfully received when no interfering packet arrives with similar power before its payload phase.

Poisson process of packets sent to it. is model, called Poisson

rain in [5, 6], assumes packet transmissions initiated from points

Φ is homogeneous in space and time, with the expected number

of transmissions initiated per unit of time and space denoted by λ. However, in Section 4.2.2 we shall also consider some space-

non-homogeneous, radially symmetric Poisson model of packet

transmissions. We assume that the packets are transmi ed with power Ptr and

su er from path-loss modeled by the usual power-law function l(r ) = (κr )β , of the transmission distance r with some constants κ > 0 and β > 2, as well as independent propagation e ects (such

as those from multi-path fading, shadowing or other seemingly

random phenomena perturbing the base-station-to-device signal)
modeled by a generi random variable F . us, a packet transmi ed from a location Xi (regardless of time) is received at the base station with power equal to

:=

PtrFi l(|Xi |)

=

PtrFi (κ |Xi |)β

where, given {Xi }, Fi are i.i.d. with common distribution of F and | · | is the Euclidean distance on the plane.
Following the system description presented in Section 3.1, we
assume that the spreading factors SF used for transmissions of
di erent packets are related to their received powers. More specifically, we consider a set of threshold powers (sensitivities) P1 < P2 < · · · < PN , for some N ≥ 1, with the corresponding spreading factors SFn , n = 1, . . . , n, and we assume that the value SFn is used for the transmission from Xi when Prec(Xi ) ∈ [Pn, Pn+1), with PN +1 := ∞. No successful reception (packet loss) is assumed when Prec(Xi ) < P1.
We have seen in Ssection 3.3 that packet transmission times
depend on many parameters, in particular the spreading factor SF. Consequently, we denote by Bn the transmission time of a packet using spreading factor value SFn and by ∆n the transmission time of the initial part, required for the base station to lock on
the transmission. During this la er part, an interfering packet of
similar power can lead to a collision, as explained in Section 3.2. More precisely, we assume that a given packet transmi ed from Xi and reaching the base station with power Prec(Xi ) ∈ [Pn, Pn+1) is successfully received if no any other packet is on air with received power in [Pn, Pn+1) during the initial time ∆n of the given packet’s transmission.

4.2 Performance analysis

We begin by recalling a useful result regarding the process of received powers in an homogeneous Poisson network model with

3

power-low path-loss model; see e.g [3, Lemma 4.2.2]. In the context of our Poisson rain network model it can be formulated as follows.

4.1. e values of powers received at the origin from all

F is the generic random propagation in the wireless channel, and λ is

the expected number of transmissions initiated per unit of time and

space.

4.2.1 Successful reception probabilities. We now consider any given (arbitrary) packet transmission arriving at the base station with power within the interval, [Pn, Pn+1) for some n = 1, . . . , N . We denote by Πn the probability that this transmission is successfully received by the base station. As previously stated, the transmission of this packet takes time Bn , with the initial time ∆n required for the base station to lock on this transmission. Using
Lemma 4.1 we obtain our rst result.

P . e result follows directly from Proposition 4.2 by substituting the values of Pn in the expressions for Πn , for n = 1, . . . , N .

Obviously, the larger target value Π, the larger all power thresholds Pn , in particular P1, meaning that more transmissions will remain unsuccessful because having a received power smaller than the minimal acceptable value P1.
4.2.3 A non-homogeneous spatial density of transmission. We consider now a non-homogeneous pa ern of transmissions. More
speci cally, let the process of transmissions form a space-time Pois-
son point process with the local density of transmission initiated at distance r from the origin being equal to λr α , for some parameter α. A natural assumption is α < 0, meaning that the density decays within the distance, but α > 0 is also possible. Obviously α = 0 is the previously considered homogeneous case.
In order to study this case we need the following extension of
Lemma 4.1.

to the probability that there is no transmission in the Poisson rain
model during the interval of time of duration Bn + ∆n , reaching the base station with the power in the same interval [Pn, Pn+1), assuming the convention PN +1 = ∞. By Lemma 4.1 and the well known
formula for Poisson void probabilities (cf e.g., [3, Section 3.4.1])

Πn = exp

Direct evaluation of the above integral completes the proof.

Note that the transmission times Bn and ∆n depend on the
spreading factor SFn used for the transmissions with received powers in [Pn, Pn+1), as well as on other parameters, as explained in
Section 3.3.

5 NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we present numerical results obtained using the

model and its analysis developed in Section 4, and assuming param-

eter values typical for a rural LoRa network.

We rst consider a homogeneous deployment of nodes paramet-

rized by the mean number Nnodes of nodes within a radius of R =

8000m around the base station, which corresponds to the spatial

density λs

=

Nnodes π R2

of

nodes

per

m2.

Suppose

that

each

node

transmits a packet to the base station every 16.666 minutes on

average, which is equivalent to the rate λt = 0.001 transmissions

per second. In order to represent this network we use the Poisson

rain model with space-time intensity λ := λs λt of transmissions per second per m2.

R

2. Note that when use the Poisson rain model we are

making an approximation of the real network. In fact, ”real” nodes

are xed in space and send (assume independent Poisson) streams

of packets in time. Nodes in Poisson rain model are not xed in

space: we may see them rather as “born” at some time, transmi ing a

packet and “dying” immediately a er. While it is possible to come up

with a model representing xed nodes in space, see e.g. the Poisson-

renewal model developed in [5, 6] for non-slo ed Aloha, its analysis

is more complicated, with less closed-form results. Moreover, most

importantly, the two models provide very close results. is can be

theoretically explained by the convergence of the space-time pa ern

of transmissions in the real situation (with xed nodes) to the Poisson

rain model when λs → ∞ and λt → 0 with λ = λs λt = constant.

Numerical results provided in [5, 6] con rm this statement.

We use the Hata model [9] to determine a suitable value for the

path-loss exponent β. In this model the path-loss in dB at distance

where

is the height of the

propagation e ects is Rayleigh fading of mean 1. With this choice

We assume that all nodes transmit with power Ptr = 10 dBm.

Other LoRa parameters are speci ed in Table 3. Note that we have N = 7 di erent values of the spreading factor SF

(running from 6 to 12). e packet and preamble transmission times Bn and ∆n , n = 1, . . . , 7, corresponding to these values are calculated using the expressions presented in Section 3.3.

5.1 Reception probabilities
Let us assume received power thresholds (sensitivities) for di erent spreading factors as in Table 1. at is, P1, . . . , P7 expressed in dBm are as in the right column of this table from bo om to top (P1 = 10−13.7dBm, P2 = 10−13.5dBm, etc, P7 = 10−12.1dBm and the corresponding values of the spreading factor are SF1 = 12, SF2 = 12, etc, S7 = 6). Using the expressions given in Proposition 4.2 we calculate the probability of successful reception Πn of packets receiving with powers in successive intervals [Pn, Pn+1), n = 1, . . . , 7. ese probabilities, calculated assuming Rayleigh fading, are shown in Fig-
ure 2. Note that increasing SF values correspond to nodes received
with smaller powers, thus located statistically in larger distances to
the base station. (When some fading is assumed then this relation
is not a deterministic function of the distance.) We observe that, up to the density of Nnodes = 2000 nodes in the disk of radius 8 km, all transmissions have a very high reception probability (close to 1), except for the three weakest power categories (SF = 10, 11, 12).

5.2 Equalizing reception probabilities for all nodes
We assume the density of nodes corresponding to Nnodes = 1000. Using the results of Section 4.2.2, we calculate modi ed values of
the sensitivity which allow all nodes to have the same reception probability equal to Π ≈ 0.95. ese modi ed sensitivities are presented in Table 4, where we also recall the values recommended by the provider of LoRa technology. Observe that for SF = 7, 8, 9 we obtain the values smaller than these recommended by LoRa provider, whereas for SF = 10, 11, 12 we obtain bigger values. Note that the reception probabilities for these two groups in case of the
recommended con guration are, respectively, larger and smaller than the target value Π = 0.95. Note also that the smallest modi ed sensitivity is −135 dBm > −137dBm, which means that we will not be able to receive packets with some small powers still acceptable for
the original con guration, unless we decrease the target reception probability Π.

Note that −135 > −137, and thus packets with some small powers are lost with respect to the original con guration.
5.3 E ect of the fading law

5.4 E ect of decaying density of nodes
Finally we consider a non-homogeneous distribution of nodes, which we assume decreasing with the distance r to the base station as the function λsr −1/5. Here λs and all LoRa parametres are assumed as in Section 5.1. We use the results of Section 4.2.3
to compute the probability of successful transmission for various
spreading factors. e results are shown in Figure 4. We observe
a very signi cant improvement and equalization of the probabili-
ties of success for all categories of transmissions, with all values presented being bigger than 0.9.

Now, we study the in uence of the propagation e ects modeled by
the distribution of F . We consider three cases: no fading i.e. F ≡ 1, Rayleigh fading of mean 1 (exponential F ) and log-normal fading of mean 1 (F = exp(−σ 2/2 + σZ ) with Z standard normal). In our
model this distribution impacts the results only via its moment E(F 2/β ). Recall that

when no fading, for Rayleigh fading, for log-normal shadowing.

In Figure 3 we show how these three di erent cases of propagation

e ects impact the probability of successful transmission of the weakest transmissions, that is using the spreading factor SF = 12.

We observe that the performance of this category of transmissions

is slightly improved by random propagation e ects. is can be

Performance of LoRa can be compared to that of the classical, nonslo ed Aloha. is can be done assuming the same Poisson rain model of packet transmissions. Let us brie y recall Aloha model assumptions and results obtained in [7] (the context being that of sensors sending packets to a sink-node).
6.1 Aloha SINR collision model
In Aloha system the base station needs to be synchronized before receiving a packet. is can be done when the base station is not locked on a di erent packet at the given packet arrival time. If this condition is satis ed, the base station starts and continues receiving the packet until the end of the transmission. However, the transmission may be lost because of the interference created by other packet emissions started during the reception, in which case the error will be detected only at the end of the reception.

where 1+λB is the (well known Erlang’s formula for the) probability that the packet nds the base station idle (ready to lock on
the transmission) when it arrives, d(x) is the probability that it is not dropped by the admission policy, and Πx is the conditional probability that it is correctly received (SINR condition satis ed),

given the base station starts receiving it. Explicit evaluation of Πx requires a ne analysis of the interference (averaged over the reception period) from di erent types of packets: non-admissible

(too weak power to lock on) and admissible ones arriving before and during the current reception. Assuming Rayleigh fading, Πx can be expressed using the Laplace transforms of these components

of the interference and of the noise, as shown in [7, Fact 3.2 with the

Laplace transforms given by (9.1), (9.2), (9.3)]. ese formulas and

their approximations developed in [7] allow one to solve various
optimization problems regarding Πx with respect to the packet admission policy d(x).

A detailed comparison of the performance of LoRa and Aloha

using the Poisson rain framework is le for future work.

7 CONCLUSION

interfering packets will be lost as well since the base station was not idle to lock on them at their arrival epochs.)
6.2 Packet admission policy
In order to improve Aloha e ciency, a packet admission policy is introduced. Once the base station detects a packet transmission it may decide to receive or ignore the detected packet according to some (possibly randomized) packet admission policy, based, for example, on the received power. e idea is to allow the base station to ignore some very weak packets, whose successful reception is hardly likely, as well as to drop some fraction of very strong packets (which will be transmi ed at another time) in order to let the base station be more o en available for packets with a moderate received power. In the model proposed and studied in [7] this admission policy took a form of the probability d(x) of packet drop (even if the base station is available) applied for packets sent from the location x on the plane. For a given path-loss model it can be related to the mean received power. It was shown how to optimize it so as to maximize the coverage or total throughput in the network.
6.3 Aloha model analysis
Assuming the same Poisson rain model of packet transmission as used in the present paper, with Rayleigh fading, the above Aloha SINR collision model, and some arbitrary probabilistic packet admission policy, it is possible to express the probability of successful reception of packets versus the transmission location x on the plane.
e analysis is however more complicated than that of LoRa due to a more complicated (detailed) SINR collision model.
More speci cally, denoting by λ the space-time density of transmissions, B packet transmission time (the same for all transmissions), the probability of successful reception of a packet transmitted from location x, by the base station located at the origin, can

We have presented a simple model to study the performance of
the node-to-base-station link in a realistic, spatial deployment of
a LoRa network, which is a type of low-power, wide-area tech-
nology destined for the Internet of ings. Crucial components
of the model are the space-time Poisson process of packet trans-
missions (called in the literature the Poisson rain model) and a
packet collision model accounting for LoRa intra-technology inter-
ference treatment, which has already been validated with respect
to measurements in laboratory conditions. Our model allows for
an explicit optimization of the packet reception probabilities with
respect to numerous LoRa parameters, taking into account possibly
non-homogeneous node deployment on the plane and various types
of wireless channel propagation e ects. In particular, it sheds light
on how the, crucial to LoRa technology, link budget thresholds
(called sensitivities) impact the performance of di erent categories
of transmissions. We have studied only one base-station scenario;
extensions to multi-base station networks are le for future work. A
fair comparison of LoRa to non-slo ed Aloha within the proposed
framework is also possible and desirable.
