Unique features
mean unique challenges:

Focus on any technique helping to get efficient and accurate results

Large scale, every is really big

Even advanced methods cannot deal with complex instances of real problems:
high dimension, constrains, epistasis, uncertain data, real time, …

Time consuming and real time
Dynamic, everything changes in time

Traditional methods put so many constrains and simplifications to the problem
(in order to solve it) that the found solution is no longer valid

Uncertainty in all tasks and phases
Complex relations, interdependences

METAHEURISTIC

Several goals at the same time
Human preferences and interfaces

Heuristic: information or procedure used to guide the search of algorithms

Lots of restrictions (legal, technical…)

Meta: high level structure containing operators later tailored to problems

Smart semaphores control: approach

Networking and

2016

Smart semaphore control: technologies

A software tool for the control center, using a bio-inspired engine, to assist the
experts on the semaphore scheduling, for a given urban area or the whole city
By means of simulation and other software facilities used in the Traffic Control
Center of the city, we can generate optimized traffic schedules and efficient
strategies of smart mobility for semaphores
Particle Swarm Optimization

Optimized schedules can then be later applied to real traffic management,
after verification tests with such a simulated program (off-line plus on-line)

Optimized semaphore schedules have benefits in terms of:

Smart road traffic optimization to avoid traffic jams and manage the city

Traffic congestion control
Prevention of severe traffic jams

Red Swarm Spots have computation and comm. abilities (infrastructure)
Vehicles use onboard units, smartphones or tablets

Reduction of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption
Driver/pedestrian safety

It distributes traffic
based on the probability
of congestion: citizen-city balance

A tech/tech combination

Customized service for every driver
First design, then use in real time

Successful scientific results

Routes is just one use

2016

Optimizing communication protocols in cities
• VANET Protocol Optimization:

Communication and computation are the bases for smart cities
Wireless communications are preferred (flexible, ubiquitious…)
All communications rely on broadcasting and routing protocols

- VANET communications imply: highly dynamic topology, limitations in
coverage, bandwidth, and energy consumption, network congestion,
frequent disconnections, and others…

Existing protocols do not work in VANETS: new and tuned ones are needed
(i) V2V: vehicle to vehicle

- An optimal configuration of the communication protocols can improve the
quality-of-service (QoS) of the network: a must in this domain

(ii) V2I: vehicle to infrastructure

- Using intelligent automatic techniques to face the huge number of possible
protocol configurations

Smart bus scheduling (I)

Networking and
Emerging Optimization

2016

Smart bus scheduling (II)
The scheduling generated by the proposed application is flexible and it also
allows to small changes (few minutes) in the departures of the buses to adjust
their scheduling to the current situation. For example:

The generalized utilization of the smart cards in
city buses and new services of free transfer
between buses allow to gather a lot of
interesting data: more common transfers, rush
hour per line, …
Applications could allow to use all those data
to generate a better flexible scheduling of
buses lines, doing an optimal utilization of the
available fleet of buses

- Quite a number of passengers (mainly students) of lines 20 and 22 do a
transfer to line 5. The scheduling of line 5 can be online tuned (only a few
minutes) if a delay is detected in lines 20 or 22

A small delay in line 20 will
ask for a small delay in the
departure of buses in line
5 and help bus transit

Smart Lighting manages the city lights in order to reduce the energy
consumption. It gives the correct illumination intensity for the city in an
adaptive, collective, and intelligent way

Sensors detect the ambient lighting in different areas of the city. Public
lighting adapt its intensity as needed
Intelligent management of public lighting has a huge impact in energy
consumption, saving a lot of money

Benefits:
Reduce energy consumption

Málaga has 239 LED street lamps, with seven different technologies. The
challenge is to fine tune their parameters to improve efficiency

public lighting represents between 40% and 70% of the electricity bill of municipalities

Increase lifetime of city lights
a 5% reduction in operating voltage will more than double the life of a traditional bulb

Minimizes light pollution
Join the green revolution!
the least polluting energy is the one that is not used

Requirements: few sensors and connectivity to city lighting

Smart cities need efficient and effective modern problem solvers
We can use existing information and procedures to improve them (a must!)
We can build small/large, context-aware and adaptive applications

http://www.fastcoexist.com/3024721/the-10-smartest-cities-in-europe

Here, solutions are both vertical (specialized) and horizontal (integral)
We must face multiple levels at smart cities: citizens, districts, city, routes,
infrastructure, city council, public/private companies…
