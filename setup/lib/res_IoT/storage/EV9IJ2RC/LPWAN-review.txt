Academics vs Industries
Let’s go back to reality!
Millions of sensors,
self-organizing, selfconfiguring, with
QoS-based multipath routing,
mobility, and …

500 sensors, STATIC deployment,
but need to have RELIABILITY,
GUARANTEED LATENCY for
monitoring and alerting. MUST
run for 3 YEARS. No fancy stuff!

Link budget example
q Received Power (dBm) = Transmitted Power (dBm) + Gains
(dB) − Losses (dB) [mainly FSL]
q Example
q Transmitted power is +14dBm (25mw)
q Losses is 120dB
q Then Receiver Power (dBm) is -106dBm

q If you have a receiver sensitivity of -137dBm you can
handle FSPL up to 151dB!
q Rewriting the equation
q
q
q
q

Losses (dB) = Transmitted Power (dBm) - Received Power (dBm)
Losses = link budget & Received Power = max receiver sensitivity
Link budget = Transmitted Power - max receiver sensitivity
151dB=14dBm - (-137dBm)

From Peter R. Egli, INDIGOO.COM

The lower the receiver sensitivity, the longer is the range!
16

Increasing range?
q Generally, robustness and sensitivity can be
increased when transmitting (much) slower
q A[Sigfox message is sent relatively slowly in a
very narrow band of spectrum (hence ultranarrow-band) using Gaussian Frequency-Shift
Keying modulation]. Max throughput=~100bps
q LoRa also increases time-on-air when maximum
range is needed. But LoRa uses spread spectrum
instead of UNB.
300bps-37.5kbps

LoRa vs Sigfox

Figure from Semtech

Figure from SigFox
Usual (ultra) narrow-band (UNB) vs spread spectrum (SS) arguments
UNB has lower in-band receive noise and SigFox can have more channels than LoRa
But UNB needs tighter receiver synchronization and more complex signal processing at receiver (SigFox uses
advanced SDR at receiver to analyse the total band)
SS can more rapidly be saturated so LoRa may have more interference issues in dense environments
From networking guys perspective, LoRa is more versatile with possibility to build ad-hoc mesh networks

30

License-free Sub-GHz
constraints
q Shared medium so long-range transmission in dense
environments can create lots of interference!
q Activity time is constrained from 0.1%, 1% 10% duty-cycle
depending on frequency: 3.6s, 36s/hour to 360s/hour

For SigFox, the operator typically limits the number of messages
per day (140) with penalty for over usage. e.g. new
messages/day = 140 – (2 * « #msg_overuse») applied during
«#msg_overuse» days

Robust channel access
mechanisms
q With densier LoRa networks and more
heterogeneous traffic (traditional+image
sensors) it is necessary to provide a more robust
channel access mechanism
q Objectives are to reduce packet collisions, thus
reducing delivery latency, and reduce power
consumption due to unsuccessfull transmissions

Quality of Service
q Regulations stipulate that radio activity duty-cycle should
be enforced at devices.
q LoRaWAN specification from LoRa Alliance is a first
attempt to standardize LoRa networks but no issues on
quality of service.
q Proposition of a Long-range Activity Sharing (LAS)
mechanism when running under duty-cycle regulations
q Allow a device to be able to send critical data without
having to wait for the next cycle

Conclusions
q Low-power, long-range (LR) transmission is a
break-through technology for IoT and largescale deployment of wireless (sensor) devices
q With a large variety of applications, products &
actors the low-power WAN (LPWAN) eco-system
is becoming mature
q New technologies will certainly emerge but the
LPWAN « philosophy » is now settled firmly: out-ofthe-box connectivity is now the standard and
multi-hop scenarios based on short-range
technologies is questionable.
