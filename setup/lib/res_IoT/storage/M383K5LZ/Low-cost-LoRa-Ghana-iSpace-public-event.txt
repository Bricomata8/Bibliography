Getting the software!

Fisrt, you will need the Arduino IDE 1.6.6 or later (left). Then get the LoRa library from our github:
https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw (right).
Get into the Arduino folder and get both Arduino_LoRa_temp and SX1272 folder. Copy
Arduino_LoRa_temp into your “sketch” folder and SX1272 into “sketch/libraries”

10	


Compiling!

Open the Arduino_LoRa_temp sketch and select the Arduino Pro Mini board with its 3.3V &
8MHz version.
Then, click on the « verify » button

11	


Uploading!

Connect the USB end to your computer and the USB port should be detected in the Arduino IDE.
Select the serial port for your device. It may have another name than what is shown in the
example. Then click on the « upload » button
