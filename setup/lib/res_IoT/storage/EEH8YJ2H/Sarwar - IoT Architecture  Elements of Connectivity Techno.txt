Connectivity Solutions for IoT
 Robust connectivity is the foundation of the Internet of Things.
 IoT - commercial and industrial “things” ranging from vending machines to planes, trains and automobiles.
 Opportunities are vast in connecting new as well as legacy “things” across these global markets
 Diverse requirements
