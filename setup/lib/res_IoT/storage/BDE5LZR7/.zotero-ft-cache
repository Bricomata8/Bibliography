Empirical Formula for Propagation Loss in

Land Mobile Radio Services

Abstract-An empirical formula for propagation loss isderived
from Okumura’sreport in orderto put his propagation prediction
method to computationaulse.The propagationloss in an urban areais presented in a simple form:A + B l o g R,where A and B are frequency
and antenna beight functions and R is the distance. The a ir to d d formula is applicable to system designs for UHF and VHF land mobile
rpdio ~enices,with a d formulationerroru, nderthefoUowing conditiom: frequency range 100-1500 MHz, distaace 1-20 km, base
station antenna height 30-2@0 m, and vehicular antenna height 1-10 m.

1) Propagationloss between isotropic antennasis treated.

2) Quasi-smooth terrain, not irregular,is treated.

3) The urbanarea propagation loss is presented as the stand-

ard formula.Forotherareas,acorrectionequation

11. PROPAGATION LOSS AND EMIPRICAL FORMULA A. Propagation Loss Between Isotropic Antennas

I. INTRODUCTION

IN SYSTEM PLANNINGforlandmobileradio service or service qualityevaluation,it is indispensable todetermine

thepropagationcharacteristics. By using manyexperimental

results and by statistical data processing, many authors have

developed nomograms and charts to permit the calculation of

expected field strengths from a given transmitter at chosen re-

ceiver locations [11-[7] and made it clear that the propaga-

tion loss shows logarithmic behavior to the distance. Of all the

studies, Okumura’s report [ l ] is very practical, because it care-

fullyarrangesfield strength and servicearea. Not only is the

report usedas comparisondatawithotherauthors’reports

[ 8 ] - [ l o ] ,b u t also thepropagationpredictionmethods

in

the report have become standard for planning in today’s land

mobile systems in Japan [111 , [121.

In Okumura’spredictionmethod,prediction curves for a

basic median field strength were given with these parameters:

base stationeffectiveantenna height hb frequency f,,and

vehicular station antenna height h,. Fig. 1 shows one of these

curves. When malung a system plan using this method, there-

fore, it is necessary to select the curves according to f,,hb, and

h,. It is more cumbersome to use these curves, represented by

1 kW effectiveradiatedpower(ERP)perdipole,sinceit

is

necessary to convert the value to the transmitter’s power. Un-

der these circumstances, even though the method

is practical

in theactualwork stage such as radio zoneestimation, it is

awkward to use directly in the system planning stage required

to fit the parameters best.

In this report,tomakecomputational use ofOkumura’s

predictionmethods in systemplanning,anempiricalformula

forpropagationloss,whichcorresponds

to freespace loss

often usedin UHF futedradio communicationsystemplan-

ning, is derived from the prediction curves.In order to avoid

complicationt,he following points were considered in its

formulation.

When the effective radiated power of an isotropic antenna is Pt (dBW: EIRP) and the received field strength of an isotropic antenna is E (dBpV/m), the propagation loss L , (dB) between these isotropic antennasis obtained as follows.
If A H is the absorptioncross sectionof an isotropic antenna and P, is the received power density, the received powerP, is given by

P r (dBm) =P, (dBm/m2) + 10 logl ( A e f f )

(1)

where A,R = A2/4n,

A: wavelength (m).

P, (dBm/m2) = E (dBpV/m) - 10 loglo (120n) - 90.

Since the propagation loss is the difference value between the radiated power and the received power, using (1)we obtain

L p (dB) = P, -P r

=P, (dBW) -E (dBpV/m) - 10 log10 (x2/4n)

+ 145.8.

B. Okumura’s PredictionCurves and Propagation Loss

As Okumura’spredictioncurves

give the receivedfield

strength at 1 kW ERP/dipole, it is necessary to transform the

unitfromERP/dipole to EIRP. This transformation is ac-

complished by adding the difference value for power gain be-

tween the isotropic antenna and the dipole antenna. Since the

absolute power gain of the dipole antenna is 2.2 dB, then

P, (dBW EIRP) = P,‘ (dBW ERP/dipole) + 2.2 (dB).(3)

When P,‘ is 1 kW (ElW/dipole), therefore, P, (dBW EIRP) is 32.2 dB.
Using (2) and (3), the progapationloss L , (dB) between the isotropicantennas is given bythepredictioncurvesandthe following equation:
L p (dB) = 178 - 10loglo(x2/4n) -E (dBpV/m). (4)

C.Empirical Formula for Propagation Loss

As astandardformula,thepropagation

lossinan urban

area over quasi-smooth terrain is introduced by using the basic

median field strength curves. By theexaminationofthese

curves, forexamplefrom Fig. 1, thecharacteristic is found

wherein the field strength E (dB pV/M) can be prescribed as a

function of distance R(km) as

E (dBpV/m) = 7 + P log10 R

tworegulations: 1) ateachfrequency f, (MHz), A decreases two by two against logarithmically increasing hb (m), and 2) when f,becomes n times as large for fixed hb, A increases in
proportion to log n. Considering these points, A can be shown as in Fig. 2. From this figure, A can be presented by
A = a - 13.82loglo h, -a(h,)
a = 69.55 + 26.16 loglo fc.

where 7 and P are constantsdeterminedby hb (m) and f,
(MHz). Therefore, the standard of propagationloss can also be prescribed by substituting(5) into (4),
L, (dB) A + B log10 R

Table I1 alsoshows two regulations: 1) B is almostindependent off,, and 2) decreases constantly against logarithmically increasing h b . B can also be shown as in Fig. 3. Connecting the mean value at each h b , it becomes an almost straight line, as shown in the figure.When this line is represented by

A = 178 - 10 log1 0 (A2/4n)- 7 + a(h,)

B=--p

(8)
the maximum fluctuation width is about *OS, and it becomes

the linear approximation error about B . Substituting (9) and

where a(h,) is the correction factor for the vehicular station antenna height h , (m). In the basiccurves, h, is 1.5 m, and

(10) into (6), the standardformulaforpropagation obtained by

loss is

correction curves for the other heightsare provided. Therefore,

it is convenient to take a = 0 dB for h , = 1.5 m and to intro-

duce the correction equation for the other heights.

(6), A is givenby thevalue of the field strength E (dB pV/m) at

R = 1 (km), and B is determinedbytheslope of the field where

111. ESTIMATION OF THEAPPROXIMATION ERR-OR
In this section we investigate how accurately the empirical formulasexpresstheprediction curves. Figs. 9 and 10 show
the propagation loss in an urban area with parameters f, and
h b , respectively.The solidlinesare the values given bythe

formula and the dashedlines are thevalues given by theprediction curves. Fig. 9 shows that the error at both ends of the frequency range is very small, and the maximum error, which occurs in the middle frequencyrange, is only about 1 dB. Furthermore,itshowsthattheerror is independentofthedistance (1-20 km) and is constant for each frequency. This is the reason that only term A in (7) depends on frequency. Therefore, the error in Fig. 9 mainly indicates the approximation error in (19) which gives termA. Fig. 10 shows that the error fluctuates about h b ,and its maximumvalue is about 1 dB. Thisis due to the

using (14)andtheplottedpointsarethecorrection

values

given by Fig. 4. As mentioned in Section 11-C, the linear

approximation error is porportional to the frequency and the

antenna height. The maximum error arises in f, = 1500 MHz

and h , = 4-5 m, and its value is about 1.5 dB. Below f, =

900 MHz,theerror is only 0.5 dB(exceptwhen h , = 4-5

m), or 1dB (in h , = 4-5 m). Consideringequation simpli-

city,therefore,itcanbe said that(14) is a simple and well-

approximated equation. The correction factor a(h,) in a large

city is mentioned in the previous section.Whuesning (16), there is

little error in f, 2 400 MHz, and the maximum error is about
1 dB in f, < 200 MHz and h , 2 5 m . In practice, there are

few cases in whch the vehicular antenna height is above 5 m.

Therefore, it can be considered that (16)is very practicable.
