Abstract:
Trust fosters cooperation in social interactions. It is widely studied in applied and academic disciplines. However, trust is a hard concept to define. Network analysis of the Web of Science citation databases shows it has multiple meanings and applications even within Computer Science. To date general models of trust are essentially conceptual, whereas workable proposals focus on special situations. In an effort to make trust simulations more generalist and applicable, we implemented the PlayGround model (Marsh, 1994) and modified it to incorporate a broader concept of trust and notions of control. Results with new model, that consider competence as a trustworthiness component, and use control to mitigate the risks, were similar to original ones from Marsh's, although the conceptual differences are significant to encompasses the many meanings of trust.
