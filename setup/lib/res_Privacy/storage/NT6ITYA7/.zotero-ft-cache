Abstract Bus transportation is considered as one of the most convenient and cheapest modes of public transportation in Indian cities. Due to their cost-eﬀectiveness and wide reachability, they help a signiﬁcant portion of the human population in cities to reach their destinations every day. Although from a transportation point of view they have numerous advantages over other modes of public transportation, they also pose a serious threat of contagious diseases spreading throughout the city. The presence of numerous local spatial constraints makes the process and extent of epidemic spreading extremely diﬃcult to predict. Also, majority of the studies have focused on the contagion processes on scale-free network topologies whereas, spatially-constrained realworld networks such as bus networks exhibit a wide-spectrum of network topology. Therefore, we aim in this study to understand this complex dynamical process of epidemic outbreak and information diﬀusion on the bus networks for six diﬀerent Indian cities using SI and SIR models. We identify epidemic thresholds for these networks which help us in controlling outbreaks by developing node-based immunization techniques.
1 Introduction
The earliest accounts of mathematical modelling to capture the spread of diseases dates back to as early as the 17th century. Bernoulli used mathematical equations to defend his stand on vaccination against the outbreak of smallpox. Works following Bernoulli’s earliest formulation of epidemic modelling helped in understanding germ theory in detail. However, this was not until the works of McKendrick and Kermack, which ﬁrst proposed a deterministic model that predicted epidemic outbreaks very similar to the ones that were recorded during those times [1]. Since

then our understanding of the mathematical models in epidemology has evolved over the years, the accounts of which can be found in the extensive works of Anderson and May [2]. All the above formulations focused on modelling epidemics over a set of population in which uniform ties between agents were assumed a priori. Also, the nature of the ties in the above models did not play any signiﬁcant role. Contrary to this, the enormous body of work during the last decade in the ﬁeld of network science has asserted the fact that ties, their strength and types in a system or a population play a signiﬁcant role [3, 4, 5]. Thus, a system or a population is not considered to be a set of individuals, rather it is considered to be a complex network of interacting individuals, where each individual or an entity is considered to be a node, and the links between them deﬁne the type of relationship one shares with the other. Interestingly, a network model is not exhaustive to the study of population, rather it is a universal framework which can be used to understand numerous complex systems in general. Also, over the years the term epidemic modelling has evolved into a common metaphor for a wide array of dynamical processes on these networks. Various complex phenomena such as percolation, the spreading of blackouts to the spreading of memes, ideas and opinions in a social network can be modelled under the common framework of epidemic modelling [6, 7, 8].
Transportation networks play a vital role in the spread of epidemics due to their widespread outreach across cities, countries and continents [9]. “Should people be worried about getting Ebola on the subway?”, was one of the numerous similar headlines that made the front pages of the newspapers around the world during the 2014 Ebola scare [10]. In this particular incident however, nobody was infected because the subject did not show symptoms of Ebola while using public transportation. Therefore not only airline networks, that can transmit pathogens across continents, even modes of public transport operating within cities such as, buses and subways pose a serious threat as well as a source of panic during desperate times. Although, epidemic spreading in airline networks have been studied extensively, similar studies on bus networks are relatively rare [3, 9]. Epidemological models have been simulated on bus network datasets; however, the results were only used to validate the numerical models. Also, a recent study on city-wide Integrated Travel Networks (ITN), have found both the traveling speed and frequency to be important factors in epidemic spreading [11]. Thus, the eﬀect of network structure and constraints in epidemic spreading are yet to be studied in these networks. In this paper we exploit the structural aspect of these networks to understand their role in epidemic spreading and diﬀusion process in detail.
2 Methodology
In this paper, we simulate the epidemic model on the bus networks of six major Indian cities, namely Ahmedabad (ABN), Chennai (CBN), Delhi (DBN), Hyderabad (HBN), Kolkata (KBN) and Mumbai (MBN) [12, 13, 14]. The route data for all these bus networks are obtained from their respective state government websites. A bus network in L-space can be considered a graph, G = (N, L), where N denotes the set of nodes and L, the set of links. The topological structure of the
2

graph is generated by considering every stop as a node, and the routes connecting

the stops form the set of links. Thus, a bus network G can be represented as a

N × N adjacency matrix, Aij whose elements aij = 1, if i and j are connected, else 0. The structure of a network in general is dependent upon the way the nodes are

connected in a network. However, bus networks fall into a special class of complex

networks where the physical constraints oﬀered by the roads and the cities result

in the emergence of the network topology [15, 16, 17, 18]. The statistical analysis

of these networks reveal a wide spectrum of topological structure. We deﬁne the

degree, ki of a node, ni ∈ N as Σiaij. The pattern of the inter-nodal connectivity is given by the degree-distribution function, P (k), which can be deﬁned as the proba-

bility of a node, k having a degree of atleast k. Some of the other network metrics

that are of particular interest are the clustering coeﬃcient, Cav which denotes the

tendency of nodes to form clusters or cliques and the characteristic path length lij.

The

local

clustering

coeﬃcient

is

given

by

C (i)

=

, 2|aij :(ni,nj )∈N,aij ∈Aij | ki(ki−1)

where

aij

is

the link connecting node pair (i, j), and ki are the neighbours of the node ni. The

neighbourhood for a node, ni is deﬁned as the set of its immediately connected

neighbours, as N = {nj : li ∈ L ∨ lj ∈ L}, and the average clustering coeﬃcient

for the entire network is given by Cav = ΣiCi/n. The characteristic path length,

lij is deﬁned as the average number of nodes crossed along the shortest paths for

all possible pairs of network nodes. The average distance from a certain vertex to

every

other vertex

is given by di

=

Σi=j

|N

dij (G)|−1

.

Then,

lij

is

calculated by taking

the median of all the calculated di ∀i ∈ Rn. Finally, an important network metric

is the degree-assortativity that tells us whether the hubs are directly connected in

a network or if they are connected through intermediate nodes. We tabulate the

statistical properties for the six networks in Table 1.

We simulate the two epidemic models SI and SIR on these networks. SI model

helps us to understand diﬀusion and percolation in these networks whereas, SIR is

the classical model that describes epidemic spreading. Both the models are simu-

lated using agent based modelling technique (igraph), where each node is considered

to be an agent whose states (S, I or R) change with every increment in simulation.

2.1 SI model

The SI model is the most basic representation of an epidemic spreading model. In

this model, there are two states that an agent or a node can exist in: S (suscep-

tible) or I (infected). The SI model describes the status of individuals or agents

switching from susceptible to infected at every instant of time. It is assumed that

the population is homogeneous and closed, i.e., no new entity is either created due

to birth or removed due to death, and also no new entity enters the system, thus

preserving homogeneous mixing in the system. The SI model also implies that each

individual has the same probability to transfer disease, innovation or information

to its neighbors. Thus, the SI model helps to capture the diﬀusion or percolation

process in the entire network. The SI model is formulated using the following dif-

ferential equation. Since an agent in the entire population can either be in state S

or I,

S+I =1

(1)

3

The SI model is governed by a single parameter, β, the infection transmission rate

or simply, the infection rate. The growth in the number of agents in either of the

sates is given by:

dS dI

= = −βSI

(2)

dt dt

Substituting the value of S from equation (1) to equation (2), we get the following

diﬀerential equation describing the growth rate of I:

dI

= −β(1 − I)I

(3)

dt

The solution of the above equation with the initial condition at t = 0, I = I0 is given by the logistic form:

I

I0 ))−1

2.2 SIR model

Contrary to the SI model, the agents in SIR model have access to three states S (susceptible), I (infected) and R (recovery). Although the earlier assumptions of a closed population and homogeneous mixing also hold in this case, the complexity of the dynamical process increases due to the addition of one more state. The agents, instead of only switching between susceptible and infected (as in SI model), tend to recover in the SIR epidemic model. The dynamics of the SIR model is controlled by two parameters: the infection rate, β, and the recovery rate, γ. The SIR model can be mathematically represented by the set of the following diﬀerential equations:

S +I +R = 1

(5)

The population of susceptible nodes decrease in proportion to the number of en-

counters multiplied by the probability that each encounters results in an infection.

The negative sign denotes that the population of S is decreasing. Similarly, we can

describe the evolution of the other two states, I and R. Nodes become infected at

a rate proportional to the number of encounters, and the probability of infection

controlled by the parameter, β. Nodes recover at a rate proportional to the number

of infected individuals, and the probability of recovery controlled by the parameter,

γ:

It would be interesting to analyze the spread of infection with respect to the sus-

ceptible individuals when there is a constant recovery (from equation (6)). We

3 Results
Both SI and SIR models, although capable of being solved analytically, their exact solutions on a network topology become highly complicated to evaluate due to the stochasticity associated with initial node selection and infection transmission. In order to understand the eﬀect of both the models on a complex network, we need to resort to numerical simulations. We discussed earlier how the structure of the networks are dependent upon the degree-distribution function, P (k). In Table 1, we present the various statistical properties of the networks studied [13, 14]. We observe that the networks follow scale-free degree-distribution patterns with varying power-law exponents, γ. In Figure 1, we simulate the diﬀusion dynamics in the networks. The plots show the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of infection transmission in the network (Y-axis) with respect to simulation time (Xaxis). As we saw in equation (4), the analytical solution for the SI model gives a logistic curve. However, the rate of diﬀusion or the slope of the curve and the saturation thresholds will be diﬀerent for diﬀerent networks due to their underlying topology. It is interesting to see how the various network metrics aﬀect information diﬀusion in the following networks. We observe that the characteristic path-length lij has a direct eﬀect on the diﬀusion rate in these networks. The above observation is quite obvious as the metric lij tells us the number of hops that are required to navigate the entire network. From Figure 1, we can observe the simulation time for MBN and HBN by looking at the steepness of the plots. While HBN exhibits the steepest ascent, MBN takes the longest simulation time, which directly correlates to the magnitudes of the characteristic path lengths of MBN and HBN from Table ??

In Figure 2, we plot the SIR simulation results for the diﬀerent networks. The SIR curve has a typical proﬁle because of the simultaneous decay of the infected individuals and the growth of the recovered individuals. The curve achieves a peak when the recovery rate equals the infection rate. We can clearly observe that the networks which display strong assortative behaviour (CBN and MBN) tend to have multiple peaks. The reason for the presence of multiple peaks can be explained by the fact that assortative networks tend to be hub-attractive, thus infection has multiple pathways to spread across the network, either from hub to hub, hub to node, node to hub or node to node. For weakly assortative and disassortative networks, only three among the above four possibilities exist (excluding hub to hub transmission). An infection transmitting from one hub to another hub is more likely to infect a larger number of nodes than an infection transmitted from a hub to a node. Thus, the threshold values would be achieved very early and the presence of stochasticity in the selection of the initially infected node will induce noise in the plots followed by multiple peaks. Similar to our previous observation, the characteristic path length lij plays a vital role in the SIR model as well. It can be clearly observed by looking at the steepness of the plots for HBN. While ABN and DBN show similar properties, the peak and the steepness for DBN is much greater than ABN. This can be attributed to the fact that the average degree, k¯ in DBN is roughly three times the average degree of ABN (see Table 1). This automatically accelerates the infection transmission rate in DBN, as each node in DBN has three times the number of choices available compared to each node in ABN.

The curves were plotted after 100 simulations; the dark line represents the median distribution, with the dotted ones above and below as the maximum and minimum thresholds.
In Figure 3 we simulate the SI and SIR models on the US airline network for 500 of the busiest airports (N = 500, L = 2980) [19]. Statistical analysis of the network reveals scale-free degree-distribution pattern between the nodes, with the characteristic path length lij = 2.92 and average degree k¯ = 12. The SI plot of the US airline network and ABN show similar pattern of growth as both of them exhibit scale-free behaviour. However, the SIR plot is similar to that of HBN due to extremely low characteristic path length and high average node degree. In Table 2, we present our ﬁndings for the networks studied in the paper. The ﬁrst column represents the simulation time (in seconds) for 80% percolation threshold from the SI model. In the second and third column, we present the epidemic thresholds for the various networks studied by computing the values of the plots from the SIR model (Figure 2) (as a fraction of network size) and the corresponding simulation times (in seconds) respectively. In the ﬁnal column, we present the characteristic path lengths for the various networks.
Finally, in Figure 4, we plot the variation in the rate of percolation by removing nodes from the network based upon their centralities and degrees. In transportation networks, other than the degree of a node, closeness and betweenness centralities play a crucial role. While closeness centrality is a measure of a node’s relative importance in the network due to the existence of shortest paths from that particular node to every other node in the entire network, betweenness centrality, on the other hand, acts as a bridging node connecting diﬀerent parts of the network together.

In order to capture their eﬀects on information diﬀusion we simulate the SI model on modiﬁed networks generated after directed removal of nodes. Since CBN and MBN are strongly assortative, we remove only two percent of the nodes (higher number of node removal will cause CBN and MBN to disintegrate into disconnected components). We ﬁnd that the removal of nodes does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the diﬀusion in ABN. However for CBN, DBN and HBN, we observe that when nodes are removed based upon their closeness centrality, the diﬀusion curve shifts towards right, thus signifying a delay in the diﬀusion process. This can be explained due to the fact that the removal of nodes based upon closeness centrality has a direct eﬀect on the characteristic path length. A node with high closeness allows every other node in the network to be reached along the shortest paths. The removal of such a node aﬀects/delays diﬀusion until the next central node is encountered. For MBN, we observe that degree-biased removal causes the diﬀusion rate to increase steeply, signifying the presence of redundant nodes that simply increase the characteristic

path length of the network. A removal of 2% of such nodes causes the diﬀusion to improve signiﬁcantly, as can be compared from the simulation times recorded in Figure 1 and 4.

4 Discussion

In this paper, we simulated diﬀusion and epidemic spreading on the bus transporta-

tion networks for six diﬀerent Indian cities, and also compared the results with the

US airline network. From Table 2, we can clearly identify the characteristic path

length to be a vital component in both, network diﬀusion and epidemic spreading.

Interestingly, the metric lij can be used as a single parameter to compare diﬀusion rates across diﬀerent network topologies. This is because ABN, DBN, HBN and

KBN exhibit small-world phenomenon due to which the characteristic path length

scales as the logarithm of the network size, i.e., lij ∼ log(N ). However, complexity arises when we have networks with comparable characteristic path lengths, like in

the case of ABN, DBN and KBN. In such cases, average node degree plays an im-

portant role. Actually, a node having a degree k has k opportunities for infection. For a network with average node degree k¯, the rate of change of the susceptible

population is given by:

dS = −βk¯SI

(10)

dt

The rate of change of the infected and simultaneously recovered individuals is sim-

ilarly given by:

dI = βk¯SI − γI

and

dR = γI

(11)

dt

dt

Note that the rate of change of the recovered individuals remains the same as before.

Substituting the value of I from equation (11) into equation (10), and solving for S

gives us the following expression for S in terms of R,

S = − (βk¯SI)dt = exp(−βk¯R)

(12)

At time t → ∞, I → 0 and S + R → 1. Population of recovered individuals, R∞ is given as, R∞ = 1 − exp(−βk¯R∞). Recovery of the individuals occur in the network if and only if the slope of R∞ ≥ 1 or β ≥ k¯−1. Similarly, we can observe from Table 2 that the values of epidemic thresholds (DBN, HBN and US air) are also strongly correlated with the characteristic path length. The epidemic threshold for DBN is particularly high compared to its comparable counterparts, ABN and KBN. The reason for this behaviour lies in the fact that DBN has a high average node-degree when compared to ABN, and is assortative when compared to KBN. This allows DBN a high degree of freedom for infection transmission. Finally, the low epidemic threshold values for CBN and MBN can be directly attributed to their considerably higher magnitudes of characteristic path length. Even though CBN and MBN are strongly assortative, the structural advantage of assortativity in diﬀusion is ruled out due to the presence of long routes mostly comprised of intermediate nodes. The eﬀect of node centralities in information diﬀusion is also

10

studied in this paper. It is found that networks are sensitive in percolation and diﬀusion to that particular metric which has a direct eﬀect on the characteristic path length. For some networks, closeness plays a crucial role (CBN, DBN and HBN). However for networks like MBN, degree-biased removal also reduces the magnitude of lij. Although, the speciﬁc node centrality directly aﬀecting the magnitude of lij largely depends upon the network structure, it can be argued that closeness of a node can be used as a marker for network immunization procedure.
5 Conclusion
We studied the functionality of the bus networks of six major Indian cities in this paper. Since experiments with epidemic outbreaks in a population (or a network) is not a viable option, we resort to mathematical modelling. We, therefore, study the eﬀect of percolation and epidemic spreading on these networks using SI and SIR epidemic models through numerical simulations. While it is observed that the characteristic path length plays a crucial role in information diﬀusion and epidemic spreading, several other network metrics also play important roles. Their importance is however restricted to their relative contribution to the topological structures of the networks. Small-world property, while an extremely desirable property in transportation networks, is highly subjective in its role of information diﬀusion, solely due to the diﬀusing entity. While diﬀusion of pathogens is an undesirable phenomenon, diﬀusion of useful information is a desirable one. In conclusion, the work presented in this paper will help us in understanding and controlling the process of diﬀusion and epidemic outbreaks in spatially-constrained networks.
