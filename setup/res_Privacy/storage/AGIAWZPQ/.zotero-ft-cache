ABSTRACT
We model a SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemics over a static, ﬁnite-sized network as a continuous-time Markov process using the scaled SIS epidemics model. In our previous work, we derived the closed form description of the equilibrium distribution that explicitly accounts for the network topology and showed that the most probable equilibrium state demonstrates threshold behavior. In this paper, we will show how subgraph structures in the network topology impact the most probable state of the long run behavior of a SIS epidemics (i.e., stochastic diffusion process) over any static, ﬁnite-sized, network.

1. INTRODUCTION
The study of networks is becoming increasingly important in a variety of disciplines. Incorporating explicitly the network topology leads to unexpected behaviors that cannot be predicted by standard models that discount topology [1].
In our work, we have been studying a diffusion process (e.g., epidemics) over a population whose interactions are captured by a ﬁxed topology network. We are interested in understanding how network topology affects the epidemics process. Previous works by others have shown that the time in which an epidemics dies out or becomes endemic relates to the largest eigenvalue of the underlying network topology ([2], [3], [4]). However, the model assumed by these references does not consider the possibility that healthy agents may spontaneously become infected without viral transmission from infected neighbors; this type of infection is exogenous to the population. In [5], [6], we introduced the scaled SIS (susceptible-infectedsusceptible) epidemics model, which accounts for both exogenous infection and exogenous healing, in addition to endogenous infection (i.e., viral transmission from infected neighbors). We derived the closed form expression of the equilibrium distribution of an epidemics over an arbitrary network topology. This paper continues our analysis of solving for the most probable network state (i.e., the network state with the maximum equilibrium probability). We introduce the model and the relevant question we address in section 2. In sections 3 and 4, we interpret network states as subgraphs of the network. In section 5, we determine how the subgraph density affects the most probable network state. Finally, section 6 concludes the paper.

2. MODEL

Consider a population of N agents whose interconnections are represented by a static, simple, unweighted, undirected, connected graph, G(V, E), where V (G) is the set of vertices and E(G) is the set of edges. The topology of G is captured by the symmetric, N × N adjacency matrix, A. The state of the ith agent is denoted by xi. Each agent can be in one of two possible states: healthy (xi = 0) or infected (xi = 1); we use the term infectives to refer to infected agents and susceptibles to refer to healthy agents. Let
x = [x1, x2, . . . , xN ]T .

We will refer to xi as the agent state and to x as either the network state or the network conﬁguration in this paper. Let X = {x}, |X | = 2N , be the network state space.
The scaled SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemics model captures the evolution of the network state over time. Let X(t) = x be the state of the network at time t, t ≥ 0. The SIS epidemics assumes that infectives can heal and become reinfected; this means that the total number of agents in the population remains constant, unlike SIR epidemics (susceptible-infected-removed). We showed in [5] that we can model X(t) as a continuous-time Markov process.
The time the Markov process spends in a particular state is random and exponentially distributed. The transition rate matrix Q is the object of interest with continuous-time Markov process. Adapting notation from [7], we deﬁne 2 operators on the network state, x = [x1, x2, . . . xi, . . . xj , . . . , xN ]T :
Hix = [x1, x2, . . . , xi = 1, . . . , xN ]T
Hj•x = [x1, x2, . . . , xj = 0, . . . , xN ]T .

The operator Hi deﬁnes the operation that agent i becomes infected. If agent i is already infected, the operator does nothing. The operator Hj• deﬁnes the operation that agent j is healed. If agent j is already uninfected, the operator does nothing.
The two types of state transitions X(t) captures corresponding
to healing and infection events respectively: 1) X(t) jumps to the network state where, a single agent, the jth
agent (j = 1, . . . , N ), is healed with transition rate:

q(x, Hj•x) = μ, x = Hj•x.

(1)

2) X(t) jumps to the network state where a single agent, the ith agent (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ), is infected with transition rate

q(x, Hix) = λγdi

is

the

neigh-

bors of node i. The symbol 1(·) is the indicator function, and A =

[Aij] is the adjacency matrix of G.

We call the parameter μ the healing rate. The parameter λ is

the exogenous (i.e., spontaneous) infection rate since if di = 0, the infection rate is still λ. The parameter γ is the endogenous infec-

tion rate since it is dependent on the number of infected neighbors;

consequently, we will also refer to γ as the topology dependent pa-

rameter and to λ and μ as topology independent parameters. The

scaled SIS epidemics model does not have an absorbing state (i.e.,

network states where all agents are infectives or all agents are sus-

ceptibles) because it accounts for both exogenous infection and the

exogenous healing [2], [3], [4].

We can derive the closed form equilibrium distribution of the

scaled SIS epidemics model. In contrast, there is no known closed

form equilibrium distribution for the more commonly used topology

dependent SIS epidemics model used in research [2, 3, 8]. We call

these type of models the additive SIS epidemics model since their

infection transition rate q(x, Hix) = λ + diγ.

2.1. Equilibrium Distribution and Most Probable Conﬁguration In [5], [6], we proved that the equilibrium distribution for X(t) is

π(x)

where Z, known as the partition function, is the normalization constant and is deﬁned as

Z=

x∈X

The equilibrium distribution is the true limiting distribution of the process. In [6], we solved for conﬁguration(s) with the highest probability since these are conﬁgurations that we would most likely observe at equilibrium. Using (3), the most probable network state, x∗, is

x∗ = arg max π(x) = arg max

(5)

Our work in [6] focused on solving (5) for different network topologies without having to solve a binary integer programming problem. We divided the parameter space into 4 different regimes:

I)

Healing Dominant: 0 <

λ μ

≤ 1, 0 < γ ≤ 1;

II)

Endogenous Infection Dominant: 0 <

λ μ

≤ 1, γ > 1;

III)

Exogenous Infection Dominant:

λ μ

> 1, 0 < γ ≤ 1;

IV)

Infection Dominant:

λ μ

> 1, γ > 1.

We summarize the main results of [6]. In regimes I and IV, for any underlying network topology, x∗ = x0 = [0, 0, . . . , 0] and x∗ = xN = [1, 1, . . . , 1]. Network topology dependence exists only in regime II and regime III, where the effect of the topology dependent process (controlled by γ) opposes the effect of the topology independent process (control by λ, μ). More interestingly for regimes II and III, x∗ exhibits threshold behavior depending on both the model parameters and on the network topology. In the rest of this paper, we focus only on regime II.

1, for three network topolo-

gies: k-regular, complete multipartite, and complete multipar-

tite with k-regular islands, the solution to (5) can only be either x0 = [0, 0, . . . , 0], the conﬁguration where all agents are susceptibles, or xN = [1, 1, . . . , 1], the conﬁguration where all agents are infectives. Furthermore, we derived the exact threshold for when x∗

transitions between these two conﬁgurations.

We observed that, for other network topologies, the solution to (5) may be conﬁgurations other than x0 or xN for certain range

of the parameters. We call these solutions spurious conﬁgurations.

Consider graph A shown in Figure 1a and graph B shown in Fig-

ure 1b. Graph A is a 16 node Erdo˝s-Re´nyi random graph, while

graph B is a 16 node Watts-Strogatz graph [1]. For these network

topologies, if we hold the λ and μ parameters constant, the solution

to (5) is a function of γ. However, this function is highly discon-

tinuous as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. We set λ = 1, μ = 2

while varying γ from 1 to 4 with incremental step size of 0.1. On

the Y-axis, we plot the total number of infectives in x∗.

Since

λ μ

=

0.5, the exogenous healing rate μ is larger than

the exogenous infection rate λ. When γ is low, the effect of the

topology independent process (λ, μ) dominates the topology depen-

dent process (γ), so the most probable network state we expect is x0 = [0, 0, . . . , 0]. But at high γ values, the effect of the topology

independent process (λ, μ) is dominated by the effect of the topology dependent process (γ) so the solution to (5) is xN = [1, 1, . . . , 1].

Note that for a narrow range of γ values, the number of infectives in x∗ is neither 0 nor 16. In the Erdo˝s-Re´nyi graph A, for

γ approximately between 1.6 and 2, it is 9. In the Watts-Strogatz

graph B, for γ between 1.3 and 1.5, it can be 14 or 15, but not 16.

These correspond to the spurious most probable network states. Figure 4a shows the actual spurious x∗ for graph A where 9 agents are

infected but 7 agents remain healthy. Figure 4b and Figure 4c show

these spurious conﬁgurations for graph B.

In [6], we only made observations regarding these spurious con-

ﬁgurations. Now we are are ready to answer the following questions

regarding these spurious solutions to (5):

1. What kind of network topologies exhibit these spurious conﬁgurations?

2. What model parameters (λ, γ, μ) will result in these spurious conﬁgurations?

We will show that the existence of these spurious conﬁgurations is related to subgraphs within the network and to the concept of

4. NETWORK CONFIGURATION INDUCED SUBGRAPH

The graph H is an induced subgraph of G if: 1) two vertices in H are connected if and only if they are connected in G [9]; and 2) the vertex set and edge set of H are subsets of the vertex set and edge set of G.
V (H) ⊆ V (G), E(H) ⊆ V (G)
In this paper, we say that H is an induced subgraph of the network state x if the nodes in the subgraph H are the infected nodes in x and the edges of H are edges where both end nodes are infected.

V (H(x)) = {vi ∈ V (G) | xi = 1} E(H(x)) = {(i, j) ∈ E(G) | xi = 1, xj = 1}.

(6)

For example, The entire network G is its own subgraph; it is the subgraph induced by the conﬁguration xN . The empty graph is the subgraph induced by the conﬁguration x0. Figures 5 and 6 show two
network conﬁgurations and their corresponding induced subgraphs.

Theorem 4.1. If the induced subgraphs of two network conﬁgurations, x1 and x2, are isomorphic, then π(x1) = π(x2).

Proof.

By deﬁnition, |V (H(x))| = 1T x and |E(H(x))| =

xT Ax 2

.

Consider that x1 and x2 induce two graphs H(x1) and H(x2).

Since H(x1) is isomorphic to H(x2), the number of nodes and the

number of edges are the same for H(x1) and H(x2) [9]. By con-

struction, we know that the number of nodes in H(x1) = 1T x1 =

1T x2, and the number of edges in H(x1)

=

xT1 Ax1 2

=

. xT2 Ax2 2

From (3), we can conclude that π(x1) = π(x2).

It’s important to note that Theorem 4.1 is only applicable to the scaled SIS model. For the more commonly used additive SIS model, we proved in [8] that two network conﬁgurations, x1 and x2 are equally probable at equilibrium if their corresponding induced colored graphs are isomorphic; this is a much stricter condition to satisfy. Consider the network conﬁgurations x1 and x2 as shown in Figures 5 and 6. The overall colored graphs are not isomorphic whereas the induced subgraphs H(x1) and H(x2) are; so these two conﬁgurations are equally probable at equilibrium only in the scaled SIS model and not in the more common additive SIS model.
In the next section, we discuss how the existence of spurious conﬁgurations is related to the density of these induced subgraphs.

5. GRAPH DENSITY

The density of graph G is deﬁned as [10]

d(G) =

|E(G)| |V (G)|

.

We will refer to the density of the entire graph G as the network den-

sity, and the density of the subgraphs of G as the subgraph density. By deﬁnition, the density of the empty graph, H(x0), is 0.

In regime II) Endogenous Infection Dominant: where 0 <

λ μ

≤

1, γ

>

1, the existence of spurious conﬁguration(s) as solu-

tion(s) to (5) is related to the existence of subgraphs whose density

is larger than the overall network density d(G). We omit the proof

here due to space constraints and simply state the following result:

Theorem 5.1.

When 0 <

λ μ

≤ 1, γ > 1, if there exists at least one

subgraph H in G with density d(H) for which

log 0<
log

λ μ

γ

d(G)

λ μ

γ

d(H

)

<

N N

,

(7)

then x∗ = x ∈ X , x∗ = x0, and x∗ = xN .

The implication of Theorem 5.1 is that in, regime II, subgraphs

which are denser than the overall graph may also be solutions to (5).

We know from Theorem 4.1 that it is possible that these solutions

are not unique since multiple dense subgraphs may be isomorphic to

each other.

We will illustrate Theorem 5.1 using Graph A, shown in Fig-

ure 1a. We know from prior numerical calculation what the spurious

conﬁguration is (see Figure 4a), so we will use Figure 2 to show the

validity of theorem 5.1.

For Graph A, N

=

16,

E

=

19,

so the network density is

19 16

.

There is at least one denser induced subgraph in Graph A (i.e., the

subgraph containing only infectives) as shown in Figure 4a. This

subgraph

has

9

nodes

and

12

edges,

so

its

density

is

12 9

.

We know

that

λ μ

we

that

the

range

of

values

for

which

is

(2

∞).

Since this is a lower bound, we can see from ﬁgure 2 that when γ is

slightly

above

2 19 16

= 1.79, the most probable conﬁguration is the

spurious conﬁguration.

Solving for the RHS of (7),

(9)

the range of range of γ values for which this is true is (0.5(−1), ∞).

Since this is an upper bound, we can see in Figure 2 that when γ is slightly below 0.5(−1) = 2, the most probable conﬁguration is a

spurious conﬁguration.

Intuitively, this shows that if the topology dependent parameter

γ

is

particularly

large

or

small

with

respect

to

a

constant

λ μ

,

then

the

subgraph structures in the network topology may not matter. Oth-

erwise, the solutions to the (5) will be dependent on the subgraph

structures in the network topology.

Finding these thresholds require that we ﬁnd the dense sub-

graphs in the network topology. In graph theory, there are two major

problems related to dense subgraphs: 1) densest subgraph problem,

2) k-densest subgraph problem. The densest subgraph problem is

the problem of ﬁnding the subgraph with the maximum density with

no constraint on the number of nodes in the subgraph. It is known

that this problem can be solved in polynomial time exactly and in

linear time in approximation for undirected graphs. The k-densest

subgraph problem is the problem of ﬁnding the subgraph with max-

imum density containing exactly k nodes. The k-densest subgraph

problem (DkS) is known to be NP-hard [10]. Knowing the solutions

to the k-densest subgraph problem will give us all the spurious con-

ﬁgurations in a given topology. We will show with rigor in future

work that just knowing the densest subgraph will give us an idea of

if we should worry about subgraph structures or not. For instance,

if we treat the epidemics as a design problem, then we can bias the

model parameters in such a way that we can ensure that the solution to (5) can only be x0 or xN for any network topology.

6. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have shown that, for the scaled SIS epidemics

X(t), we can interpret the network states of the epidemics as in-

duced subgraphs; therefore, induced subgraphs that are isomorphic

are equally probable in equilibrium. This is a less strict condition

than the one we derived for the additive SIS epidemics in [8]. Sec-

ond, we showed that in regime II) Endogenous Infection Domi-

nant:

where 0

<

λ μ

≤

1, γ

>

1, the spurious conﬁgurations (i.e.,

solutions to (5) other than the non infected x0 and the whole popula-

tion infected xN ) correspond to subgraph structures in the network

topology that are denser than the overall network topology. In future

work, we will prove that if we know the density of these subgraphs then we can ﬁnd the thresholds where x∗ transitions from x0 to the

spurious conﬁguration(s) and from the spurious conﬁguration(s) to xN .
