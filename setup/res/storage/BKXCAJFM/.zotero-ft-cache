1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In this project, we propose DSENSE, a mobile wireless charging and sensing platform using drones to allev iate the pain of energy delivery and data gathering in traditional wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSN). DSENSE combines the new technology of drone platform with the wireless charging technology based on electromagnetic radiation with the intention of powering the sensor nodes deployed in remote locations (e.g., embedded in walls, in soil), retrieving and forwarding sensor data packets to the cloud. This kind of mobile charging and sensing method executed by drones is demonstrated to be effective and efficient–DSENSE successfully drives WRSN-based monitoring services in both a high-rise building and a large farmland. Co mpared with traditional hu man operation, not only monitoring t ime but also the whole system costs has decreased a lot, which b rings a new opportunity to the environmental mon itoring field.
2. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
WRSN are used in a wide range of applications from large scale terrestrial habitat monitoring to structure health detection because of their ability to measure a mu lt itude of environmental variables with h igh frequency over long periods of time. In some practical applications, sensors are deployed in remote and dangerous locations provide unprecedented amounts of data, powering these sensors and uploading the sensor data to cloud server remain challenges. A lot of research has been focused on the increase of sensor’s lifetime such as adding other infrastructure (e.g. solar panels or wind generator) or periodic maintenance to batteries. Such kinds of method would no doubt cost a large mount of manpower and material resources , and s ome sensor nodes are deployed in peculiar locations(e.g. embedded in structure or located in primeval forests ) wh ich human can’t reach or very dangerous to reach. Although sensors in a WRSN can be replen ished by mobile wireless chargers over distance, challenging issues remain in many aspects. For examp le, stable wireless charging is hardly achievable in remote locations, and harvested energy on

Ground Station

sensor nodes is usually insufficient to establish an ad hoc network with mu lti-hop communicat ions [1].
In this project, we developed DSENSE to address the problems of using the drone platform equipped with 915M Hz RF energy transmitter to charge sensor nodes in hard-to-access locations. The maximu m charging distance is about 10m and maximu m charging power is 3W, DSENSE also enables charging of sensors through concrete, wood and some other metalloid materials. A trajectory file with node locations is generated and pre-downloaded to the drone. Nevertheless, users can also take over the control at any time through the 433M Hz Mav Link.
In this project, we applied DSENSE in high-rise building structure health detection and large farmland environmental monitoring. The real-t ime sensor data is shown in the cloud server, and all the flight parameters of drone plat form can be observed through ground station.

The wireless charging technology based on the RF energy transmission especially is a hot topic nowadays. There are three main ways to implement the RF-energy transferring: electro magnetic resonance, electromagnetic radiation and electromagnetic induction. The electro magnetic resonance method requires larger coils, which does not meet the practical need of the wireless rechargeable sensor nodes. The energy transmission of the electro magnetic induction is carried through the electro magnetic coupling between two coils which has been applied in Paper [2]. In this method, the distance between the coils is very short, therefore the drone must be very close to the sensor nodes, which requires the drone of high location accuracy and endangers the drone itself. Co mpared with magnetic induction, far field radiation-based charging achieves longer ranges and a high degree of freedo m [3].In order to charge the sensor nodes, firstly the RF transmitter produces steady and reliab le electro magnetic waves that will be harvested by the energy harvesting antenna of the sensor nodes and then converted into continuous DC pulse. Secondly this pulse will be converted into the DC voltage through the chopper circuit. DSENSE t ransfer the 915MHz electro magnetic frequency that, being tested, is of the highest energy transmission efficiency. The experiments in the demo have shown that DSENSE charg ing-energy conversion efficiency can reach 74.1%, the maximu m charging distance is about 10m, and DSENSE also enables charging of sensors through concrete, wood, glass and other metallo id materials. DSENSE wireless charging system is mainly co mposed of the RF transmitter and the wireless rechargeable sensor nodes.
The hardware design of the wireless rechargeable sensor node is main ly d ivided into four modules: the energy harvesting antenna, the energy conversion, the sensors and the module of microprocessor and ZigBee co mmunicat ion. The energy harvesting antenna, adopting the Patch antenna of 915MHz central frequency, is used to harvest and convert the electromagnetic waves into the high-voltage pulses. The

RF-DC energy conversion chip, connected with transceiver antenna after impedance matching, is used to convert the high frequency high voltage pulse s produced by the antenna into the stable DC voltage and store it into the super capacitor. According to the practical applications, varieties of analog output sensors with u ltralo w power dissipatio n have been designed for DSENSE, which can perceive and collect the environmental information. The module of microprocessor and ZigBee co mmun ication module adopts the CC2530 chip, with an 8051 inner core and the good performance of a leading RF transceiver, is used to process and send the sensor data to the sink node through the antenna.
The launching power of the RF transmitter can be adjusted according to the practical need. The direction of electro magnetic wave is concentrated and the energy transmission efficiency is high. This RF transmitter contains an oscillator, power amplifier, power and antenna. The VCO adopts the narrowed voltage-controlled oscillator chip of 915M Hz central frequency and is used to produce steady and reliable signals of 915MHz. The power amp lifier adopts the RF t riode circuit of high power and is used to amplify the original signals. The module of power is co mposed of the lithiu m battery of high capacity, the relevant level changer and the filter circu it, and is used to supply power to the whole RF trans mitter. The module o f antenna, adopting the right hand circular polarization RFID Patch antenna of 915M Hz central frequency, features large coverage, high energy concentration and less energy consuming of the space scattering. After collecting the sensor data, the power supply RF transmitter will be shut off the automat ically to prevent energy loss. 3.2 Drone Platform
The drone platform of Dsense adopts four- rotor aircraft. A trajectory file with node locations is generated and pre-downloaded to the drone, including GPS of searching fixed-location, high timing hover, auto matic returning, obstacle-avoiding and so on. The fly ing system of Dsense adopts the open source platform of Pixhawk that the firmware can be set according to practical flying requirement. Th is platform is equipped with gyroscope, accelero meter, magnetic gauge, barometer and other flight requisite sensors. In addition, to improve the flight and hovering stability, an optical flo w camera with a duplicate image detection algorith m are proposed to assist GPS and improve the location accuracy to eliminate the mistakes of the barometer in the low altitude. Besides the requisite hardware, the RF trans mitter and the sink node are fixed on the drone, too. After reaching the location of sensor node,

the drone hovers and launches the RF transmitter to charge. Once the sensor data is collected, the drone stops hovering and carries on the next flight plan. The whole drone platform is controlled by a real-time ground station that can communicate with the drone through MavLink p rotocol of 433M Hz at any time. The instant GPS, the alt itude, the speed, and other flight parameters of the drone can be seen clearly in the control panel. 3.3 Cloud Server
Once power transfer process is completed, the sensor data is transmitted to a sink node placed on the drone through ZigBee p rotocol, and then is forwarded to a certain access gateway using TCP/IP protocol after being analyzed and processed. The sensor data is finally stored in a cloud database, a visual graphical interface (Figure 3) wh ich features historical data processing, query, retrieval, statistics and waveform drawing is also available on webpage at the same time.

4. IMPLEMENTATION
We fully implemented DSENSE on a Pixhawk open-source drone platform and conducted field experiments in two different scenarios (see Figure 4). In the first experiment, rechargeable sensor nodes were deployed onside walls of each floor of a 12-floo r, 38m-height dormitory building to mon itor the temperature, humidity, strain and displacement etc. In addition, we deployed seven sensor nodes in a large farmland in the north of Hang zhou to monitor soil temperature, mo isture and illu mination of crops. With a t rajectory file downloaded, the drone flew to sensor nodes, one after another, charged them and retrieved the data. Received data was also displayed on a cloud webpage, together with all flight info rmation of the drone. After a long period field testing, continuous improvements have been made to achieve better perfo rmance. Besides structure and farmland monitoring mentioned above, we have been conducting DSENSE on bridge damage detection and wild water quality mon itoring, wh ich obtained great progress to a certain so far. We firmly believe that DSENSE will one day replace tradit ional environmental monitoring method and have a huge application market.
