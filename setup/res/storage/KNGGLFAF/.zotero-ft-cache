RELATED WORK

A. IoT Architecture IoT architecture addresses essential factors like Quality of Service (QoS), confidentiality, reliability, integrity, etc. In this section, we will briefly look into the basic and service oriented architecture of IoT. The basic layered architecture of IoT is proposed in [2], [3] and [4] as shown in Figure 2 below [2]. Each architectural layer is briefly described as: The perception layer consists of sensor devices viz, RFID, ZigBee, Quick Response (QR) code, etc. to deal with overall device management and to collect specific information by each type of sensor devices. The network layer forwards information from perception layer to upper layers and keeps sensitive information confidential from sensor devices. Functions of middleware layer are service management and storing lower layer information into the database. The application layer manages IoT applications such as smart health, smart transportation, etc. The business layer covers entire IoT applications and services management.

B. Protocols in IoT This section discusses briefly protocols and security measures of IoT. In a telecommunication connection, end points use a special set of rules and regulations to communicate with other end points in a network. In this section, some of the IoT data protocols are discussed briefly and how they interact with the IoT gateway is shown in Figure 4 below. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) runs over Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that provides ordered lossless connections. It is a client server messaging protocol which delivers messages with minimized transport overhead [6]. There are three quality of service (QoS) for MQTT protocol viz, ‘at most once’ which ensures that messages are delivered according to availability of the operating environment, ‘at least once’ which ensures message arrival and ‘exactly once’ which ensures message arrival exactly once. MQTT has an astonishing mechanism of notifying an abnormal disconnection. For constrained nodes and constrained networks, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is used as a web transfer protocol. Constrained nodes often have 8-bit microcontroller with miniature random access memory (RAM) and read only memory (ROM) whereas constrained network results in high packet error rate [7]. Request response interactive model is provided by CoAP and supports built-in services and resources [8]. CoAP meets web requirements like multicasting, minimized overheads and simplicity.

Fig. 2. IoT Basic Layered Architecture [2]
IoT architecture can be service oriented. Its four layers are as shown below in Figure 3 [5]. The sensing layer integrates with hardware. The networking layer supports data transfer over the network. The service layer creates and manages services. The interface layer provides interaction between user and applications.

Fig. 3. Service Oriented IoT Architecture [5]

Fig. 4. IoT Protocols [9] Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is message oriented middleware open standard application layer protocol [10]. Features of AMQP are: message orientation, queuing, routing and security. Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a protocol for real time communication and is used in applications like voice and video calls etc. [10]. WebSocket provides browser based applications, a two-way communication with server consisting of a handshake followed by message framing [11]. Interaction between browser and web server increases as it facilitates transfer of real time data from and to the server. TCP port number 80 is used for communication. Websocket provides full duplex communication.

C. IoT Security Measures IoT takes care of security measures by using many technologies as discussed below [12].
x ZigBee: ZigBee is developed by ZigBee Alliance which is standard for personal area networks (PAN) and is two-way wireless communication standard for short range applications [12]. ZigBee provides low cost, low power, reliable communication. ZigBee protocol stack contains four layers as shown below in Figure 5:
Fig. 5. ZigBee Protocol Stack [13]
ZigBee is positioned on top of Physical and Media Access Control (MAC) layers which are defined by IEEE 802.15.4 standard. ZigBee consists of Application, Network & Security layers. ZigBee interfaces directly with MAC layer which has the following services [12]:
a.) Access Control: MAC selects devices to which it needs to communicate depending on MAC address.
b.) Encryption: MAC uses symmetric key cryptography to protect data.
c.) Frame Integrity: The device which receives data should be able to detect modification in message.
d.) Messages in Sequence: MAC prevents replay attacks as MAC frame uses structured series of values.
ZigBee cryptography uses 128 bit keys and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption [14]. Three types of keys are used:
a.) Network Key: It is used in all nodes and is common to all nodes in ZigBee network.
b.) Link Key: A secret session key for connected device communication.
c.) Master Key: It is used to generate link key.
x Bluetooth
Bluetooth establishes wireless PANs and is an open standard for short range radio frequency communication [15]. There are four security modes in Bluetooth:
a.) Security Mode 1: In this mode, security procedures are never initiated.
b.) Security Mode 2: Authorization is introduced in this mode. c.) Security Mode 3: Authentication and encryption is enabled
for all connections.

d.) Security Mode 4: In this mode, security procedures are initiated after link establishment.
Besides security modes, Bluetooth also provides three encryption modes to provide confidentiality:
a.) Encryption Mode 1: Communication is not encrypted. b.) Encryption Mode 2: Individually addressed traffic is
encrypted. c.) Encryption Mode 3: All kinds of traffic are encrypted. Bluetooth technology is prone to networking threats. Some of them are discussed below: a.) Bluejacking: It involves users sending Short Messaging
Service (SMS) to other Bluetooth devices. In this, attacker can be saved as contact if content is not appropriately documented. Hence the attacker can send any content which will be automatically opened as it came from a known contact. b.) Car Whisperer: In this attacker, can transmit content to car’s speakers or can receive content from microphone in the car. c.) Bluesnarfing: Hackers access Bluetooth devices and get the content of devices through International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) [15].
x RFID
Automatic identification of things and people is done by RFID. RFID has three components viz., tag, reader and back-end database [16]. RFID operates in three frequency ranges Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF). RFID devices are divided into two groups [17]:
a.) Active: Active RFID requires power source. b.) Passive: Passive RFID do not require batteries.
RFID encryption levels are Encryption Mode 1: Traffic is not encrypted, Encryption Mode 2: Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Encryption Mode 3: AES-128 bits. In spite of the above-mentioned encryption modes, RFID have potential security threats as discussed below:
a.) Clandestine scanning-In this, RFID tags are scanned without authorization.
b.) Clandestine tracking-Chip id is omitted without any information of the holder of the tag.
c.) Skimming and cloning-Duplication of tag is possible if tag’s secrets are known to hacker.
d.) Cryptographic weaknesses-Encrypted data can be decrypted if weak encryption is done.
x WiFi
WiFi allows wireless communication and enables Internet access in the form of radio signals [18]. Possible attacks can be network access control, security of data and network design [19]. WiFi uses six security modes as discussed below [12]:
a.) Security Mode 1: Overall security of WiFi network information.
b.) Security Mode 2: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), WiFi Protected Access (WPA) and WPA2 encryption.
c.) Security Mode 3: MAC addresses filtering. d.) Security Mode 4: Protocol filtering.

e.) Security Mode 5: Shield Service Set Identifier (SSID) broadcast information.
f.) Security Mode 6: IP address assigning.
WiFi is also vulnerable to many threats viz [12]: a.) Wireless Network Eavesdropping: Information is collected from network by snooping transmitted data. b.) Search wireless signal attack: When a device searches for a wireless network and if the network is not encrypted then it is potentially dangerous to connect to such a network.

APPLICATIONS OF IoT

IoT is applicable in every sphere of life. IoT applications are shown

diagrammatically in Figure 6.

Fig. 6. IoT Applications [23]
Also IoT applications are described briefly below [2]: x Assisted Driving: For better navigation and safety; cars, trains and buses are equipped with sensors and actuators to provide information to drivers and/or passengers about accidents, road closures, etc. [20]. This information can be used to perform route optimization. x Mobile Ticketing: Information regarding transport services can be outfitted with Near Field Communication (NFC) tag [21]. The mobile phone can be hovered over the NFC tag to get information by the user. Information retrieval is done by the mobile phone automatically and suggestion is provided to the user about tickets. x Social Networking: Real-time updating of location about user’s activities on social networking websites. x Sensing: Sensors enable devices to diagnose conditions of patients by providing real time information. Continuous monitoring is provided to every patient with multiple wireless technologies.

x Homes and Offices: Deployment of sensors in houses and offices makes life easier like room heating can be tailored as per user preferences or weather; alarm and monitoring systems can be implemented, etc.
x Identification and Authentication: Preliminary phases of security apply to various phases of healthcare which are used to manage and improve medical staff morale by addressing patient safety issues.
x Thefts and Losses: Precious objects can be tagged and their location can be retrieved if the object is moved from a particular constrained area. In this way, probability of loss due to object misplace can be minimized.
