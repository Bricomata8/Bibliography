Abstract— With the growth of sharing economy, P2P resource sharing services are combined with social networks for improving user experience and giving more trustworthiness to users. For trust management, many P2P resource sharing services adopt feedbackbased reputation system. Since peers in services have their social relationship in the community, reputation includes not only trust related to services but also subjective social trust which causes bias of reputation. In this paper, we propose the method that objectifies feedback-based trust by removing social trust from rating points. We conduct simulation and verify the proposed method can objectify feedback-based trust preciously with optimized parameters by using lambda square discrepancy measure.

I. INTRODUCTION
An evolution of information communication technology (ICT) leads the advent of the peer-to-peer (P2P) resource sharing services from the traditional rental economy. The P2P resource sharing service has been the promising business model due to sharing possessions that are not usually used and alleviating the cost of utilizing things such as a house, clothes, or a car with the economic coordination. Airbnb[1] is one of the pioneer in the P2P resource sharing market which provides the platform to share users’ houses. P2P resource sharing services tried to collaborate to online social network services for improving user experience and giving more trustworthiness to guests[2]. On the other hands, P2P resource sharing services also tried to utilize user’s location information. Peerby[3] provides a platform to share not only a car or a house, but also small things such as a camera, camping tools, and so on with peers lived in same town.
For enriching the sharing economy, trust management is inevitable, because the appearance of malicious user without trust declines the user participation to services and ruins the ecosystem of sharing economy. Thus, trust analysis of sharing economy has been studied in a variety of research area. The most popular method to assess trustworthiness of peers in P2P resource sharing services is using the feedback-based reputation. Many P2P resource sharing services such as Airbnb[1], Uber[4], and Blablacar[5] are using the feedback based reputation scoring to evaluate the trust of peers who act as sharers and users. Each of them assesses their opponent in respect to his/her honesty or cooperativeness by the rating point as a feedback. If someone got lower rating point than the policy

ruled by each service, he/she receives disadvantage from the service, e.g. temporal ban on the service.
This typical feedback based trust evaluation currently does not adapt to recent approaches on P2P resource sharing services. In the past, a user and a sharer in the online service rarely know each other and it makes peers assess their trust related on the service only as Fig. 1(a). However, the effort to adopt the social network to the P2P resource sharing services make that social groups involve in the online sharing community. That is, reputation score depends on not only the quality of service provided by a sharer but also the social relationship between a user and the sharer as Fig. 1(b).
If a user and a sharer are friends, then they can overrate their trustworthiness by assessing high rating point each other. It can bias the decision of peers who newly join the sharing community or do not participate in social groups. Indeed, a research of Blablacar[6] shows that 94% and 92% of respondents in 11 countries score their feedback with 4 or 5 points out of 5 as their level of trust to their family and friends, whereas only 58% of them rank 4 or 5 points out of 5 as their level of trust to their colleague who has less social relationship than friends and family. Therefore, it is necessary to figure out the objectified trustworthiness of each peer in respect to the service.
In this paper, we analyze a rating point, that is, the feedback-based trust, of the P2P resource sharing service and divide the rating point into two factors: service trust and social

trust. The service trust is the trustworthiness of the sharer or the user related to the service and the social trust is the trustworthiness based on the social relationship between peers. Through subtracting the social trust from the rating point, we can get objectified trust evaluation result related to the service. We conduct simulation based on real rating point distribution, and verify to obtain the trust related to sharing services through proposed method.
The rest of this paper is composed of several chapters. Chapter 2 introduces related works about the trust evaluation and chapter 3 proposes our proposed objectification method for feedback based trust evaluation. Chapter 4 conducts the simulation and analysis, and finally we conclude the paper in Chapter 5.
II. RELATED WORKS
The trust has been studied in various research areas for a long time. The definition of trust is a measure of confidence that an entity will work in an expected way from the perspective of trustor[7]. Mayer et al.[8] define the trust with factors as integrity, benevolence, and ability. Integrity means honesty of peer participated in trust relationship and benevolence means the willingness of cooperation between peers in trust relationship. Ability implies the capacity for fulfilling requested action between peers in trust relationship. These factors are important to analyze trust in detail.
Traditional studies on trust evaluation can be separated to three categories: Policy-based, reputation-based, and socialbased trust[9]. The policy-based methods evaluate the trust value whether the credentials of trustee match up to the policy which ruled by the trustor or not. Reputation-based approaches evaluate the peer’s trust using a system which aggregate the feedback of peers about their opponent’s integrity, benevolence, and ability[9]. Feedback based reputation evaluation is the most popular method to assess the trustworthiness of peers in e-commerce services. Paul et al.[10] studied the trust among peers in Ebay[11], which is one of the famous e-commerce service. They investigate the ability of a peer (e.g. the discount rate, fast shipping) and the integrity of a peer (e.g. the quality of a product, etc.) Mehmet et al.[12] studied the patterns of participation and exchange in Airbnb. In detail, they investigated how income, race, and education affect the economic activity on Airbnb and found that the education is a heavily influential factor.
The social trust utilizes the social relationship to evaluate the trustee’s benevolence, integrity, and ability from the trustor’s point of view. The social trust is divided into the explicit social trust and implicit social trust[13]. The explicit social trust comes from the social network topology, such as the graph similarity between peers, the number of friends, and betweenness centrality, etc.[14] For example, a peer who has many friends can be estimated to have more benevolence and integrity than other peers. Moreover, peers trust their friends[15], that is, peers estimate the integrity of their friends higher than others. The implicit social network is measured by checking the communication history[16]. Peers, who do not connect to each other in online social network, also can generate the social relationship. If they interact with each other

Fig. 2. Proposed trust objectification method
through messengers or e-mail, then they have implicit social trust. The frequency and the duration of the communication affect to the implicit social trust.
As the social group engaged in the P2P resource sharing community directly or indirectly, the feedback-based trust, which is usually utilized on P2P resource sharing services, has been biased because a rating point as a feedback of sharing services includes not only the trust related to sharing services itself but also subjective social trust. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the objectification of feedback-based trust by getting rid of social trust from the rating point.

III. TRUST ASSESSMENT
We begin our study from the verification of the proposition that if there are social groups in the sharing community, a rating point, that is, the feedback-based trust is biased by the social trust. The rating point of a peer in P2P resource sharing services represents the ability such as the technical skill of user, the integrity such as the quality of shared thing, the honesty of a user, and the benevolence such as the cooperativeness between peers. The studies shows that if they are friends or have any social relationship, then they believe in each other more than others [6][15]. Their relationships increase the measure of integrity and benevolence, and it becomes the increase of rating point. Thus, a proposition is true that the feedback-based trust is biased by the social trust if there are social groups in the sharing community.

To objectify the feedback-based trust, we propose trust objectification method considering social relationship. The method assumes that the rating point that the peer gives to his/her opponent includes the trust related to the quality of service as well as the social trust. Therefore, it considerately measures the social trust between peers who are participated in the sharing transaction and subtract the social trust from the rating point for obtaining the objectified trust of peers in the service. In Fig. 2, the process of the proposed method for objectifying the rating point is described. By taking average the service trust, a peer can get his/her own service trust which reveals his/her genuine trustworthiness related to the service.

The rating point of peers in the sharing community with social groups can be shown as below:

URab = TUSab + αTSab

(1)

322

SRab = TSSab + βTSab

(2)

, where URab is the rating point of a user B from a sharer A’s point of view and SRab is the rating point of a sharer B from a user A’s point of view. TUS is the trust as a user in the service, and TSS means trust as a sharer in the service. TUSab means TUS of a user B from sharer A’s point of view, and TSSab means TSS of a sharer B from a user A’s point of view. TS means the social trust and TSab is the value of TS between A and B. Using α and β, which are normalizing constants, we handle the effect of TSab to the TUSab or TSSab. Thus, TUS and TSS can be obtained by subtracting normalized TS between peers in the sharing transaction. It is described in below:

TUSab = max[URab – αTSab, 0]

(3)

TSSab = max[SRab – βTSab, 0].

(4)

To figure out the representative peer’s trust related on the sharing service, we need to find the TUS and TSS values from entire sharing transactions, and take average these values. They are shown as below:

(5)

(6)

, where n is the number of sharing transactions that the user is B, and m is the number of sharing transactions that the sharer is B. After the calculation, we obtain the representative trust of peers as a user and a sharer in the service.

To find the TUS and TSS, we need to define the social trust in detail. The social trust is divided into implicit and explicit social trust. Therefore, TS is figured out through the equation below:

TSab = γTSIab + (1– γ) TSEab

(7)

, where TSIab means the implicit social trust, TSEab means the explicit social trust between peer A and B, respectively, and γ is the weighted factor between the explicit social trust and the implicit social trust.

The implicit social trust can be obtained by the communication history, its frequency, and the amount of communication [16]. For example, although two people do not have any social relationship in online social network, if they communicate each other frequently for a long time through other methods, then they also have the social trust. Information entropy is utilized to measure the implicit social trust from the communication history. Let pa is the fraction of message of peer A to peer B in the communication space and the implicit social trust is shown as below:

(8)
, where n is the amount of messages on the communication space, cth is the threshold of the available number of messages on the communication space and pb is same as 1 – pa because the subject of sending message is composed of {A, B}, that is, Bernoulli trial. δ is the normalizing constant, because the value of information entropy is up to 0.5. n needs to be more than cth, because it is possible that only two mutual messages in the

communication space make the maximum value on the implicit social trust.
The explicit social trust is based on the social topology of the online social network service. There are many trust evaluations based on the social graph and network structure. For example, the betweenness centrality can be obtained by analyzing the social network topology and it means the degree of importance or influence of an entity[14]. In the P2P resource sharing service, peers are likely to trust a peer who has more similarity between he/she and a peer[17]. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the explicit social trust based on the similarity of peers’ neighbors, namely, adjacent nodes, on the social topology using the Jaccard index, also known as the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Jaccard index measures the similarity between sets of peers’ neighbors; Let NA be the set of neighbors of peer A and NB be the set of neighbors of peer B, then the Jaccard index is shown as below:
(9)

, where ε is the normalizing constant, because the value of Jaccard index is up to 1.
IV. SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS
In this section, we conduct the simulation to verify the performance of proposed objectification method that gets rid of social trust from the rating point of sharing services. For environment setup, we choose Python 2.7.11 with open source library NetworkX 1.10 for simulating social network.
Our simulation starts with 100 peers in the sharing community. The peer acts as both a user and a sharer in the sharing community. All peers are connected to each other following Barabasi-Albert (BA) graph and each node has minimum five edges. Each user randomly makes transaction with each other. A number of transactions follow uniform distribution within the range of 10 to 100. In each transaction, a user and a sharer make a rating point UR and SR to each other.
The dataset of rating point is based on the rating point on the real car sharing service, Blablacar[6]. We refer to the distribution of rating point on friends who have social trust between the peer and colleague who have less social trust than friends. Table 1 shows the distribution of rating point on friends, which means the rating distribution with social relationship. Besides, Table 2 shows the distribution of rating point on colleagues, which means the rating distribution with less social relationship.

If the proposed objectification works, the distribution of rating points of friends changes to that of colleagues.
In this simulation, we assume that UR and SR follow the same rating distribution mentioned in the Table 1, so we consider only UR from now on. Metrics to figure out TUS are UR and TS. TS is composed of TSE and TSI. We assume that TSI between two peers is a random real number value between 0 to 5 following Pareto distribution with parameter 1 because a number of peers who mutually communicate nearly are much less than a number of peers who rarely talk each other. TSE between two peers is based on BA model which a peer has at least five connections to other peers. Table 3 lists the default parameter values.
To manipulate UR, TSI, and TSE, α and γ are the most important constants. Increment of α means TS, which is the social trust and weighted summation of TSI and TSE, more affects to the UR, and decrement of α is the reduction of influence of TS from UR. On the other hand, increment of γ means we regard TSI as more important than TSE, otherwise, TSE is more important than TSI.
Prior to the trust objectification, we generate more than 5000 sharing transactions between two peers in the social network. Each transaction is composed of four tuples, {user_id i, sharer_id j, URji, SRij}. After that, we figure out TUSji with the control of α and γ and compare the distribution of TUSji and the rating distribution in Table 2 by using lambda square discrepancy measure[18]. The lambda-square discrepancy measure is the modeling methodology to see the discrepancy, i.e., the distance between the empirical data and the analytical model. By dividing the discrepancy with the amount of the data set, it is suitable to see the distance between the massive empirical data and the model. For a value near to 0, it means there is no discrepancy, thus we can find the optimal α and γ where lambda-square value is lower than others. The lambdasquare discrepancy is shown as below:
(10)
, where

(11) and

(12)

, and n is the number of bins which means the unit separating the measure. As mentioned in Table 1 and 2, there are 6 bins {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for the rating point. N is the number of dataset. In this simulation, N is more than 5000, because UR includes in each transaction. Oi is the number of users in bin i of the empirical data which are TUS, on the other hand, Ei is the number of users in bin i of the analytical data, which is on Table 2.

The lambda square discrepancy measure between the distribution of rating point in Table 2 and distribution of TUS which is obtained by subtracting social trust from UR in each resource sharing transaction. To control the distribution of TUS, we change both α and γ from 0 to 1 in 0.1 scale. Table 4 shows the lambda square discrepancy with various α and γ.

We find that the difference is lowest when α is 0.4 and γ is 0.8 and its value is nearly 0. That means proposed method is able to successfully objectify the feedback-based trust by removing social trust. Moreover, when we get rid of 40% of social trust which include 80% of implicit social trust and 20% of explicit social trust between two peers from rating points, we can get the optimized objectified rating points.
We also investigate the influence of elimination of the social trust to the peer with high degree and the peer with low degree in the social network because the peer with high degree has more explicit social trust than the peer with low degree. However, when we check the difference between UR and TUS as well as SR and TSS of every peers in the network with 0.4 for α and 0.8 for γ, there is no correlation between the difference between UR and TUS as well as SR and TSS. The correlation coefficient between the degree of a peer and the difference between average value of UR and average value of TUS of a peer is –0.17 and that between the degree of a peer and the difference between average value of SR and average value of TSS of a peer is –0.03, which means there are no correlation.
