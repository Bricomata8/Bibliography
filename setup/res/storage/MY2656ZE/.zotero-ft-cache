Abstract: This paper deals with modelling of traffic networks for real time control purposes. A modular framework based on coloured timed Petri nets is proposed to model the dynamics of signalized traffic network systems: places represent link cells and crossing sections, tokens are vehicles and token colours represent the routing of the corresponding vehicle. In addition, an ordinary timed Petri net models the signal timing plan controlling the area. The proposed modelling framework is applied to a real intersection located in Bari, Italy. A discrete event simulation of the controlled intersection validates the model and tests the signal timing plan obtained by an optimization strategy presented in the related literature.

I. INTRODUCTION
Traffic signal on surface street networks plays a central role in traffic management. Most of the currently implemented traffic control systems are grouped into two principal classes (Patel and Ranganathan, 200 I, Wey, 2000): I) fixed-time systems and 2) vehicle actuated systems. In the first group, the control system determines fixed timing plans by using an off line optimization performed by computer programs. The second class of traffic control strategies employs actuated signal timing plans and performs an on-line optimization and synchronization of traffic signals. In the real-time optimization control strategy, detectors located on the intersection branches monitor traffic conditions and feed information on the actual system state to the real time controller. Moreover, the controller selects the duration of the green phases in the signal timing plan in order to optimize a performance index (Patel and Ranganathan, 2001, Wey, 2000, Dotoli , et al., 2003 , Barisone et al., 2002) .
Two main different approaches are developed in the related literature in order to model and analyze the behaviour of vehicles in Traffic 1\etworks (TN s) and may be classified according to the level of modelling

detail. First. microscopic models describe both the system entities and their interactions with high level of detail. However, these high-fidelity microscopic models and the resulting software are costly to develop and execute. Second, macroscopic models represent the traffic streams in an aggregate manner, e.g. by scalar values of flow rate, density and speed. These lower fidelity models are less costly to develop and maintain, but their representation may be inaccurate and not valid.
Petri net based models are suited to describe signal traffic control and concurrent activities in TNs (Giua, 1991 , Di Cesare, et al., 1994) . In particular, Di Febbraro, et al. , (2002) present a traffic model in a timed Petri net framework, where tokens are vehicles and places are parts of lanes and intersections. However, in ordinary Petri nets tokens can not distinguish among different vehicles and their associated routes . Colours are introduced in (Di Cesare, et al., 1994), where a different colour is assigned to each vehicle entering the system. However, the model methodology developed in (Di Cesare, et al., 1994) does not use the coloured Petri net paradigm to simulate the system, that IS substantially modelled with ordinary Petri nets.

This paper has two objectives. First, it presents a Coloured Timed Petri Net (CTPN) model to describe in a microscopic formulation the flow of vehicles in an urban TN system. The token colour represents the path which a vehicle has to follow and places are cells accommodating one vehicle only. Moreover, the paper models the TN traffic light and determines the green phases duration using an optimization method based on a macroscopic model (Dotoli, el af., 2003, Barisone el af. , 2002). Second, the proposed CTPN model generates the code to simulate real intersections and to test the actuated control strategy proposed in (Dotoli, et aI., 2003 , Barisone el al., 2002). Hence, a case study is presented and the traffic flow in a real intersection located in the city of Bari, Italy, is simulated in different traffic scenarios.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the basics of CTPNs . Moreover, Section 3 defines the CTPN modelling the TN and the traffic light. Section 4 describes the case study and reports the results of a simulation performed under different traffic scenarios. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the conclusions.
2. BASICS OF COLOURED PETRI NETS
A Coloured Petri Net (CPN) is a bipartite directed graph represented by a quintuple CPN=(P, T, Co , Pre, Post) , where P is a set of places, T is a set of transitions, Co is a colour function that associates with each element in Pu T a non empty ordered set of colours in the set of possible colours Cl (Jensen, 1992). Co maps each place p,EP to the set of possible token colours Co(P)={ ai.1 ,ai,2, ... a,";} ~Cl, where u,=ICo(P,)1 is the number of possible colours of
tokens in Pi. Note that we use symbol IAI to denote
the cardinality of the generic set A. Analogously, Co maps each transition Ij E T to the set of possible occurrence colours CO(I;)={ b;. I,bp ,... ,bi "; } ~Cl with u;=ICo(tj) l·
H is a weight function for an inhibitor arc that connects a t;ansition to a place. More precisely, an inhibitor arc labelled aE N between PiEP and Ij ET (i.e. , H(Pi,lj)=a) implies that as soon as there are a tokens in Pi, the arc inhibits the firing of t)' Note that N is the set of non-negative integers.
Now, we define a non-negative multiset a over the set D as a mapping a: D-'?N (Jensen, 1992). Matrices Pre and Post are the pre-incidence and the post-incidence matrices, respectively. In particular, each element Pre(pi,t;) is a mapping from the set of occurrence colours of Ij ET to the set of non-negative multisets M.,Co(p ,)) over the set of colours of PiE?' More precisely, we denote Pre(pi,tj): Co(t) -'?l\{Co(p)) as a matrix of U,XUj non-negative integers, whose generic element Pre(pi,tj)(h,k) is equal to the weight of the arc from place Pi with respect to colour ai.h to transition tj with respect to colour b; k-
Analogously, Post(Pi,!;): Co(t) -'?M.,Co(p ,)) for each t.ET to each PiEP corresponds to the set of directed ~rcs from T to P. Hence , we denote by Post(p"t) a

matrix of UiXUj non-negative integers and the scalar Post(Pi,tj)(h,k) is the weight of the arc from transition tj with respect to colour bj .k to place Pi with respect to colour aih. Finally, the incidence matrix C of
dimension IPlxl71 is defined as C(Pi,t;)=Post(Pi,tj)-
Pre(p"lj).

For each place PiEP, we define the marking rni of Pi as a non-negative multisel over CO(Pi). The mapping rni: Co(P,)-'?N associates with each possible token colour in P, a non-negative integer representing the number of tokens of that colour that is contained in Pi. In the following we denote rni as a (UiX 1) vector of non-negative integers, whose h-th component mi(h) is equal to the number of tokens of colour aih that are contained in Pi. The marking M of a CPN is an mdimensional column vector of multi sets, i.e., M=[rn] ..•rnIPl]T Finally, a coloured Petri net system <CPN,Mo> is a CPN with initial marking Mo.

Given a CPN and a node xEPu T, the set -x=LVEPu T: (y,.x:}EF } is the preset of x and X-={yE Pu T: (x,Y)EF} is the post-set of x. Now, a transition tj ET is enabled with respect to colour bj.k at a marking M if and only if for each PiE-Ij, we have:

m ,(h)~re(pi, t;)(h,k) for h=I ,... ,ui.

If an enabled transition fires with respect to colour bib then we get a new marking ,tJ', where:

m 'i(h)=mi(h)+Post(Pi,tj)(h ,k)-Pre(Pi,lj)(h,k)

for

h=I ,... ,ui and for eachpiE-t;utj- ,

m 'i(h)=m;(h) otherwise.

Now, to investigate the performance of the system it is convenient to extend the ePN with the time concept. To do this, we introduce a global clock, i.e. , the clock values 't E ~W represent the model continuous time. Moreover, the temporization of Petri nets can be achieved by attaching time either to places, to transitions (Desrochers and AI-Jaar, 1995) or to the expression functions of arcs (Jensen, 1992). Here we choose the second option and we consider timed transitions and immediate transitions. More precisely, the firing time of each transition Ij , namely FT; , is a positive number specifying the deterministic duration of the firing of Ij . In this method, each token has a time stamp attached to it, in addition to token colours. The time stamp is described by the function s: Co-'?9t+ where s(c) indicates the earliest delay after which the token of colour CE CO becomes available and can be removed by an enabled transition. Hence, as soon as the e-colour token arrives to the place Pi enabling transition I}' s(e) is set to FT;.

Accordingly, after FT; time instants , the enabled transition Ij becomes ready to fire. If FT; is equal to zero, the transition is said to be an immediate transition .

3. MODELLING A SIGNALIZED I1\'TERSECTION AREA
3.1 The traffic network description.
In the proposed TN model, we consider the following fundamental components: signalized intersections, links and vehicles. More precisely, each link represents the space available between two adjacent intersections and may include one or several lanes. Hence, a generic signalized urban area comprises a number of junctions controlled by traffic lights pertaining to a common semaphoric cycle, including a set L= (Lil i= I, ... I} of I links (see figure 1). A generic link Li of length li with i= 1, .. .1 has a finite capacity c,>O denoting the number of vehicles that a link can simultaneously accommodate. Hence, each link is divided in C, cells with unit capacity. We assume that lane changing is allowed only in road.
Moreover, it is necessary to take into account the physical space that a vehicle crossing the intersection occupies. Such a physical space, named intersection cell, can be occupied by only one vehicle and may coincide with the whole intersection area in a very simple intersection or with a part of the physical space in a multi-lane intersection.
3.2 The coloured timed Petri net modelling the urban area.
In our model the CPN=(P, T, Co, H, Pre, Post) describes the IN in a modular representation. The CPN can be divided in two subnets: the first one describes the urban area comprising roads and junctions and the second describes the traffic lights pertaining to the common signal timing plan. Referring to the first subnet, a place PiEP denotes a resource, i.e., a cell in a lane or in a crossing section, that a vehicle can acquire. More precisely, we have t\VO types of places: places representing link cells and places corresponding to intersection cells.
In addition , transitions from T,eT model the flow of vehicles into the system between consecutive resources. We consider five types of transitions:
1) input transitions to.i E h modelling the input
of a vehicle in a link from the outside of the considered intersection;

Fig. 2. Layout of a real traffic intersection located in the urban area of Bari, Italy.

2) output transitions tio E To, modelling the output of a vehicle from a link to the outside of the considered intersection;
3) flow transitions tj E h, modelling the flow of
vehicles between two consecutive link cells; 4) intersection transitions tj ETe, modelling
vehicles entering or leaving a crossing section. The intersection transitions that model a vehicle entering the crossing sections are regulated as a multi-phase traffic light;
5) lane changing intersection transitions lj E TL, modelling vehicles that change lane in road.

Transitions

belonging

to

the

set

Tv=T/V TouT;:uTcu h are timed transitions. The

value of FT; assigned to each tj E T;:u TL or Ij E Te is

equal to the average time interval in which a vehicle

passes from a cell to the subsequent one or occupies

an intersection cell, respectively, and depends on the

vehicles speed . Moreover, the value of to.j ET,

(f).oE To) is equal to the mean interval times in which

vehicles can enter (leave) the system network.

Obviously, these parameters can change during

different traffic scenarios to model different

congestion levels.

A coloured token in a place represents a vehicle . The colour of each token is the routing assigned to each vehicle indicating the different paths that a vehicle can follow starting from a particular position. For instance, with reference to figure 1, in link L ,
a, vehicles can have three different colours: if the
vehicle has routing (L " L7, L ,, ), a2 if the vehicle route is (L " L9) and a 3 if the vehicle route is (L" L7, L,o). Finally, inhibitor arcs are introduced to model the finite capacities of each resource. More precisely, for each transition lE T;:uTcU TL and for each PiEI., there exists an inhibitor arc between Pi and t, i.e. , H(P i, I)=l. Comparing our model with the model proposed in Di Cesare , et af. (1994), we point out that the above assumptions allow us to obtain a concise and modular model, so that the development of the resulting simulation sofrware is inexpensive.

To show the modelling technique, Example describes a real traffic intersection located in the urban area of Bari, Italy, depicted in figure 2. We

209

consider in the example a single junction. However, the modularity of the proposed model allows us to represent several intersections and to connect two consecutive links simply considering the output transitions of the first link coincident with the input transitions of the next link.
Example 1. The real traffic intersection shown in figure 2 is composed by 6 links Li (i=I, ... ,6) with length li=I.r=I)=ltF60m and 1]=13=40m, respectively. The capacities of the links are CI=C4=C=CtFI2 PCUs (Passenger Car Units) and Cl =C3=8 PCUs, respectively, derived by assuming that one PCV is lo=5m long . Figure 3 shows the CPN modelling the intersection. Places Pi, P 'i, with i=I ,... ,9 are a subset of places modelling cell links and places Pi, P 'i with i= 10, 11 ,12 model the intersection crossing area composed of six cells. For the sake of simplicity, the figure shows just two places for each lane in an input link and one place for each lane in an output link. Moreover, in this example we suppose that lane changing is not allowed .

With reference to figure 3, transitions la.}, 10.2> 10.3 , 10, 4 and 10,5 are input transitions and transitions 11,0, 1],0, 13. 0 and 14.0 are output transitions. Transitions I}, 1'1 , I;, 16, I '6 model vehicles entering a crossing section and are controlled by the traffic light Petri net. Vehicles travelling in the intersection are tokens of 6 colours. More precisely, colours a / and a] are associated with vehicles following the routings (L /, L4) and (L /, L2), respectively. Moreover, colours a3, a4 refer to vehicles following the routings (L 6, L;) and (L6' L.) , respectively. Finally, colours a5, a 6 represent vehicles following the routings (L3, L5) and (L 3, L.), respectively. Referring to the definitions of matrices Post(Pi,l) and Pre(p i,!j) given in section 2 , we show as an example the following matrix entries, obviously the other ones are determined similarly: Pre(p 'lo,! '7)(1 ,I)=1 and Pre(p '/0, 1'7)(h,k)=0 for h,k=2 ,... ,6, POSI(P 'IJ, I'7)(1,I)=1 and Posl(p 'JI ,I '])(h,k)=O for h,k=2 ,... ,6, POSI(P7,/})(2,2)= I , POSI(P 7, ll)(3 ,3)= I, Pre(p '/0,/2)(2,2)=1 , Pre(p '/0, 11)(3,3)=1,

Finally, the firing times of the transitions for the eTPN modelling the traffic light in figure 4 are reported in Table 1 for the four traffic scenarios described in the sequel.

3.3 The coloured limed Pelri nel modelling Ihe Iraffic lighls.
To model the traffic lights controller we use a formalism presented in the related literature (Di Febbraro, el aI. , 2002) . Since the Petri net modelling the traffic lights is rather simple, neutral colour tokens are considered. Moreover, places represent phases and transitions model the succession of red, yellow and green phases. To show the method to model a generic signal timing plan, we describe the Petri net representing the traffic light of the signalized intersection of Example I, depicted in figure 4. To control the intersection in figure 2, a three-phase traffic light is used, modelled by three places representing the red, yellow and green phases, respectively. Hence, to model the phases of the cycle, nine places are necessary. In particular, a neutral colour token in place p /3 enables transitions I , and I ,' to rule the vehicles of link I. Moreover, places P,4, P'5 and P'6 describe the state of green, yellow and red, respectively. Moreover, the firing times FT9, FT,o, FTJ, referring to the corresponding transitions are the time intervals of green, yellow and all red (clearance time) of the traffic light of link I. In a similar way, we describe the traffic light ruling link 6 and modelled by places PI;, PIS, P'9 and P20 and the traffic light ruling link 3 and modelled by places P2' , Pn , P23 and P24' Finally. the immediate transition 1'6 and place P25 are introduced to obtain for the traffic light in link 3 a different phase with respect to link 6, even if they start at the same time .
The start of the semaphoric cycle is with a token in P'4 and in PiS (green for link 1). When the red phase begins for link 1 transition I" fires and the green
phases start for links 6 and 3 (tokens in PJ7 and pd·
The green phase for link 3 is shorter than the green phase of link 6: a token in P25 means that lir '- _'. is in the red phase and link 6 is in the green , ~ .:.low

4. SIMULATION RESULTS

This section presents a simulation study performed for Example 1. The eTPN model of the signalized intersection reported in figure 3 was implemented and simulated in the Matlab environment. Indeed, the simplicity and modularity of the model suggest us to use an efficient software such as Matlab that allows us to simulate systems with a large number of places and transitions. Obviously, the eTPN simulation could be carried out in a generic commercial or freeware tool.

Starting 'from the initial marking m 13=m14=1 and

mi(h)=O for each Pi , EP and for each colour ai.h, the

discrete event simulation program executes the

eTPN in a fixed run time. Three simulation

experiments are performed, each referring to a

different traffic scenario. Each test is conducted for

K=3 semaphoric cycles, of duration C=80s each, for

a total run time T=KC=240s. In the first three

experiments we use the fixed timing plans actually

applied to the real intersection and independent from

the traffic congestion. Table 1 reports the phases of

the traffic light. In particular, the first case simulates

under-saturated traffic: one vehicle every 6.7 seconds

enters on average links L , and L6 each, and one

vehicle every 26.7 seconds enters L3, respectively (see Table I). The simulation model generates as an

output the number of vehicles leaving each link L , in

the run time and the average number of vehicles

queued in link Li directed to link LF Figure 5 shows

(light grey) the average number of vehicles queued in

each input link Li (i= 1,3,6) and directed to an output

link

L J

U=2,4,5).

The

second

experiment

simulates

a

medium congestion traffic condition: one vehicle

every 5 seconds enters on average links L , and L6

each, and one vehicle every 20 seconds enters L3, respectively (see Table I). Figure 5 (dark grey)

reports the average number of vehicles queued in the

input links, showing that these are characterized by a

medium congestion, with queue sizes higher than

those reported for scenario 1. In particular, L, and L6

contain respectively 6.4 and 7.3 vehicles on average,

then they are halfway to saturation, being C,=Cr 12
PCUs. Finally, the third experiment simulates over-

saturated traffic : one vehicle every 4 seconds enters

on average links L , and L6 each, and one vehicle

every 16 seconds enters link L3, respectively (see Table 1). Figure 5 (black) shows the average queue

sizes. Now input link L , is oversaturated, with 12.5

vehicles on average and C,=12 peus, while L6 is

almost saturated , with 10 vehicles on average and

Cr 12 PCUs. Experimental evidence has proven that
the simulation results are consistent with real traffic

data in the considered scenarios.

timing plans are depicted in figure 6. Clearly, the performance index OF(lO) improves considerably controlling the network with the optimized plan. Hence, results show the benefits in applying an actuated traffic control strategy, that is able to modifY the traffic lights phases with traffic congestion .
5. CONCLC'SIONS
This paper provides a coloured timed Petri net model to describe a traffic network system focusing on real time control via a connected traffic light. The obtained microscopic model is able to give an accurate and valid representation to provide a simulation software not costly to develop. Moreover, the paper presents a real case study where simulation tests the traffic light phases derived by an optimization method proposed ID the related literature. Simulation results give a confirmation of the model capability to correctly predict traffic performance measures.
REFERENCES

Now, in order to further validate the proposed model, with reference to Example I, we apply a different signal timing plan obtained by the optimization method proposed in (Barisone, et aI., 2002 , Dotoli, et aI. , 2003). More precisely, the green phases of the connected traffic lights are determined dynamically, i.e., on the basis of traffic data, in order to minimize traffic congestion. In fact, the strategy is suited to be applied in an actuated control scheme. The minimized objective function is the following:

~ [I OF(K) = L

ni(k)] ,

i= {1.3.6} K k=1

where OF(K) is measured in K=IO cycles and denotes the average number of vehicles per cycle in the input links. In particular, the optimized signal timing plan differs from the original plan in the green phases allowing flow from L , to L2 and L4, from L3 to L4, from L6 to L2 and L4 respectively. Moreover, Table I reports the values of FT9, FT'2 and FT' 4 of figure 4 obtained by the optimization method for scenarios I and 2 (dynamic).

Figure 6 shows that the simulation computes a lower number of vehicles in the queues if the intersection is controlled with the dynamically-optimized timing plan for K= I 0 cycles in scenarios I and 2. Comparison between the results obtained for the fixed and optimized timing plans under scenario 3 is neglected, since in such a case the TN is oversaturated. However, to stress the benefits of the optimization strategy, we consider a fourth traffic scenario , in which the LrL4 direction is close to saturation and the L,,-L6 direction is under-saturated (see Table I for the corresponding values of the input transitions firing times). Applying the optimization method yields FT9=49, FT,r I 0, FT'2=19 seconds, prioritizing the congested direction LrL4. The simulation results with the original and optimized
