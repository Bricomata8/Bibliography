In this work, we aim to find out if text contains private content by using our novel learning based approach `privacy detective' that combines topic modeling, named entity recognition, privacy ontology, sentiment analysis, and text normalization to represent privacy features. Privacy detective investigates a broader range of privacy concerns compared to previous approaches that focus on keyword searching or profile related properties. We collected 500,000 tweets from 100,000 Twitter users along with other information such as tweet linkages and follower relationships. We reach 95.45% accuracy in a two-class task classifying Twitter users who do not reveal much private information and Twitter users who share sensitive information. We score timelines according to three privacy levels after having Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers annotate collected tweets according to privacy categories. Supervised machine learning classification results on these annotations reach 69.63% accuracy on a three-class task. Inter-annotator agreement on timeline privacy scores between various AMT workers and our classifiers fall under the same positive agreement level. Additionally, we show that a user's privacy level is correlated with her friends' privacy scores and also with the privacy scores of people mentioned in her text but not with the number of her followers. As such, privacy in social networks appear to be socially constructed, which can have great implications for privacy enhancing technologies and educational interventions.","title":"Privacy Detective: Detecting Private Information and Collective Privacy Behavior in a Large Social Network","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society","shortTitle":"Privacy Detective","creators":[{"firstName":"Aylin","lastName":"Caliskan Islam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Walsh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Greenstadt","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JWHMAHZB"],"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/AKPX9Y47"]},"dateAdded":"2018-02-17T00:49:40Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:37:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/KCRCQD4D","attachments":[{"key":"DVMCP3S2","version":295,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2670000/2665958/p35-islam.pdf?ip=132.227.79.222&id=2665958&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=7EBF6E77E86B478F%2EA72B4D473219EA0C%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1525277769_e0ff20c37b51d9e04b0c485c42f1f873","accessDate":"2018-05-02T16:11:44Z","title":"Caliskan Islam et al. - 2014 - Privacy Detective Detecting Private Information a.pdf","parentItem":"KCRCQD4D","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Caliskan Islam et al. - 2014 - Privacy Detective Detecting Private Information a.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Unfortunately, this wealth of social information is fragmented across many different proprietary applications. Combined, it could provide a more accurate representation of the social world, and it could enable a whole new set of socially-aware applications. We introduce Prometheus, a peer-to-peer service that collects and manages social information from multiple sources and implements a set of social inference functions while enforcing user-defined access control policies. Prometheus is socially-aware: it allows users to select peers that manage their social information based on social trust and exploits naturally-formed social groups for improved performance. We tested our Prometheus prototype on PlanetLab and built a mobile social application to test the performance of its social inference functions under realtime constraints. We showed that the social-based mapping of users onto peers improves the service response time and high service availability is achieved with low overhead.","title":"Prometheus: User-controlled P2P Social Data Management for Socially-aware Applications","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the ACM/IFIP/USENIX 11th International Conference on Middleware","shortTitle":"Prometheus","creators":[{"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Kourtellis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Finnis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Anderson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Blackburn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Borcea","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adriana","lastName":"Iamnitchi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["VJ5ZGL9W"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-06T23:17:42Z","dateModified":"2018-06-07T16:37:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CBGXYNBB","attachments":[{"key":"7C4FJNYW","version":120,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org.accesdistant.upmc.fr/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2023733&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-06T23:17:55Z","title":"Kourtellis et al. - 2010 - Prometheus User-controlled P2P Social Data Manage.pdf","parentItem":"CBGXYNBB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kourtellis et al. - 2010 - Prometheus User-controlled P2P Social Data Manage.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-06T23:17:55Z","dateModified":"2018-03-13T20:58:26Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":728,"key":"CBGXYNBB"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088594644,"version":0},"$loki":94},{"itemID":729,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":120,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org.accesdistant.upmc.fr/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2023733&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-06T23:17:55Z","title":"Kourtellis et al. - 2010 - Prometheus User-controlled P2P Social Data Manage.pdf","parentItem":"CBGXYNBB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kourtellis et al. - 2010 - Prometheus User-controlled P2P Social Data Manage.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-06T23:17:55Z","dateModified":"2018-03-13T20:58:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7C4FJNYW","itemID":729,"key":"7C4FJNYW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088594644,"version":0},"$loki":95},{"itemID":774,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":171,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"https://link-springer-com.accesdistant.upmc.fr/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24550-3_16","series":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","publisher":"Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg","pages":"193-207","ISBN":"978-3-642-24549-7 978-3-642-24550-3","date":"2011/10/10","extra":"00019","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-24550-3_16","accessDate":"2018-03-06T23:48:12Z","libraryCatalog":"link-springer-com.accesdistant.upmc.fr","conferenceName":"Symposium on Self-Stabilizing Systems","language":"en","abstractNote":"The pervasiveness of the Internet has lead research and applications to focus more and more on their users. Online social networks such as Facebook provide users with the ability to maintain an unprecedented number of social connections. Recommendation systems exploit the opinions of other users to suggest movies or products based on our similarity with them. This shift from machines to users motivates the emergence of novel applications and research challenges.In this paper, we embrace the social aspects of the Web 2.0 by considering a novel problem. We build a distributed social market that combines interest-based social networks with explicit networks like Facebook. Our Social Market (SM) allows users to identify and build connections to other users that can provide interesting goods, or information. At the same time, it backs up these connections with trust, by associating them with paths of trusted users that connect new acquaintances through the explicit network. This convergence of implicit and explicit networks yields TAPS, a novel gossip protocol that can be applied in applications devoted to commercial transactions, or to add robustness to standard gossip applications like dissemination or recommendation systems.","title":"Social Market: Combining Explicit and Implicit Social Networks","proceedingsTitle":"Stabilization, Safety, and Security of

search engine algorithms to get higher than their deserved rankings in search results by using several types of spamming techniques. Many web spam demotion algorithms have been developed to combat spam via the use of the web link structure, from which the goodness or badness score of each web page is evaluated. Those scores are then used to identify spam pages or punish their rankings in search engine results. However, most of the published spam demotion algorithms differ from their base models by only very limited improvements and still suffer from some common score manipulation methods. The lack of a general framework for this field makes the task of designing high-performance spam demotion algorithms very inefficient. In this paper, we propose a unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithms by abstracting the score propagation process of relevant models with a forward score propagation function and a backward score propagation function, each of which can further be expressed as three sub-functions: a splitting function, an accepting function and a combination function. On the basis of the proposed model, we develop two new web spam demotion algorithms named Supervised Forward and Backward score Ranking (SFBR) and Unsupervised Forward and Backward score Ranking (UFBR). Our experiments, conducted on three large-scale public datasets, show that (1) SFBR is very robust and apparently outperforms other algorithms and (2) UFBR can obtain results comparable to some well-known supervised algorithms in the spam demotion task even if the UFBR is unsupervised.","title":"A unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithm","creators":[{"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Zhuang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chin-Chen","lastName":"Chang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Peng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Faisal","lastName":"Khurshid","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["VJ5ZGL9W"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-07T17:26:04Z","dateModified":"2018-06-19T13:49:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/3QGAUCUS","attachments":[{"key":"6YBDFJRH","version":117,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://link-springer-com.accesdistant.upmc.fr/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10791-017-9307-9.pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-07T17:26:17Z","title":"Zhuang et al_2017_A unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithm.pdf","parentItem":"3QGAUCUS","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhuang et al_2017_A unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithm.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

One of the fundamental difﬁculties is quantifying the amount of information revealed unintentionally. We present PrivAware, a tool to detect and report unintended information loss in online social networks. Our goal is to provide a rudimentary framework to identify privacy risk and provide solutions to reduce information loss. The ﬁrst instance of the software is focused on information loss attributed to social circles. In subsequent releases we intend to incorporate additional capabilities to capture ancillary threat models. From our initial results, we quantify the privacy risk attributed to friend relationships in Facebook. We show that for each user in our study a majority of their personal attributes can be derived from social contacts. Moreover, we present results denoting the number of friends contributing to a correctly inferred attribute. We also provide similar results for different demographics of users. The intent of PrivAware is to not only report information loss but to recommend user actions to mitigate privacy risk. The actions provide users with the steps necessary to improve their overall privacy measurement. One obvious, but not ideal, solution is to remove risky friends. Another approach is to group risky friends and apply access controls to the group to limit visibility. In summary, our goal is to provide a unique tool to quantify information loss and provide features to reduce privacy risk.","title":"Measuring Privacy Risk in Online Social Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Becker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["UASSXJNU"],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/AKPX9Y47"]},"dateAdded":"2018-03-13T20:52:04Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:37:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EK2I2FWV","attachments":[{"key":"GESQM5C9","version":319,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf","parentItem":"EK2I2FWV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-01-19T09:56:10Z","dateModified":"2018-03-13T21:28:25Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1210,"key":"EK2I2FWV"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088594868,"version":0},"$loki":115},{"itemID":14,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":319,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf","parentItem":"EK2I2FWV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-01-19T09:56:10Z","dateModified":"2018-03-13T21:28:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/GESQM5C9","itemID":14,"key":"GESQM5C9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088594868,"version":0},"$loki":116},{"itemID":1254,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":172,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"193","date":"2012","extra":"00011","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","title":"On the Design of Socially-Aware Distributed Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Kourtellis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{"dc:relation":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/AKPX9Y47"]},"dateAdded":"2018-03-16T12:27:09Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T20:31:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/AVD8ZF7K","attachments":[{"key":"VV9SC8NF","version":16,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Kourtellis - 2012 - On the Design of Socially-Aware Distributed System.pdf","parentItem":"AVD8ZF7K","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kourtellis - 2012 - On the Design of Socially-Aware Distributed System.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Bitcoin has demonstrated in the ﬁnancial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bitcoin, transactions in our system are not strictly ﬁnancial – they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to blockchains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.","title":"Decentralizing Privacy: Using Blockchain to Protect Personal Data","shortTitle":"Decentralizing Privacy","creators":[{"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Zyskind","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oz","lastName":"Nathan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alex 'Sandy'","lastName":"Pentland","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ED2DJ6VG"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T09:39:09Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:38:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/VRLJPRDM","attachments":[{"key":"6J8KA2H9","version":222,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://enigma.co/ZNP15.pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-28T09:39:06Z","title":"Zyskind et al. - 2015 - Decentralizing Privacy Using Blockchain to Protec.pdf","parentItem":"VRLJPRDM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zyskind et al. - 2015 - Decentralizing Privacy Using Blockchain to Protec.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T09:39:06Z","dateModified":"2018-03-28T09:39:11Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1778,"key":"VRLJPRDM"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595016,"version":0},"$loki":141},{"itemID":1777,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":222,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://enigma.co/ZNP15.pdf","accessDate":"2018-03-28T09:39:06Z","title":"Zyskind et al. - 2015 - Decentralizing Privacy Using Blockchain to Protec.pdf","parentItem":"VRLJPRDM","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zyskind et al. - 2015 - Decentralizing Privacy Using Blockchain to Protec.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-03-28T09:39:06Z","dateModified":"2018-03-28T09:39:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/6J8KA2H9","itemID":1777,"key":"6J8KA2H9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595016,"version":0},"$loki":142},{"itemID":1806,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":172,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"50","date":"2009","extra":"00168","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"Users and network administrators need ways to ﬁlter email messages based primarily on the reputation of the sender. Unfortunately, conventional mechanisms for sender reputation—notably, IP blacklists—are cumbersome to maintain and evadable. This paper investigates ways to infer the reputation of an email sender based solely on network-level features, without looking at the contents of a message. First, we study ﬁrst-order properties of network-level features that may help distinguish spammers from legitimate senders. We examine features that can be ascertained without ever looking at a packet’s contents, such as the distance in IP space to other email senders or the geographic distance between sender and receiver. We derive features that are lightweight, since they do not require seeing a large amount of email from a single IP address and can be gleaned without looking at an email’s contents—many such features are apparent from even a single packet. Second, we incorporate these features into a classiﬁcation algorithm and evaluate the classiﬁer’s ability to automatically classify email senders as spammers or legitimate senders. We build an automated reputation engine, SNARE, based on these features using labeled data from a deployed commercial spam-ﬁltering system. We demonstrate that SNARE can achieve comparable accuracy to existing static IP blacklists: about a 70% detection rate for less than a 0.3% false positive rate. Third, we show how SNARE can be integrated into existing blacklists, essentially as a ﬁrst-pass ﬁlter.","title":"Detecting Spammers with SNARE: Spatio-temporal Network-level Automatic Reputation Engine","creators":[{"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Hao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nadeem Ahmed","lastName":"Syed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Feamster","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alexander G","lastName":"Gray","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Krasser","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:38:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WE7FASVW","attachments":[{"key":"HWXQMZ2U","version":338,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec09/tech/full_papers/sec09_network.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","title":"Hao et al. - Detecting Spammers with SNARE Spatio-temporal Net.pdf","parentItem":"WE7FASVW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hao et al. - Detecting Spammers with SNARE Spatio-temporal Net.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-13T07:59:55Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1806,"key":"WE7FASVW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595040,"version":0},"$loki":143},{"itemID":1805,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":338,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec09/tech/full_papers/sec09_network.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","title":"Hao et al. - Detecting Spammers with SNARE Spatio-temporal Net.pdf","parentItem":"WE7FASVW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hao et al. - Detecting Spammers with SNARE Spatio-temporal Net.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T07:59:54Z","dateModified":"2018-04-13T07:59:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/HWXQMZ2U","itemID":1805,"key":"HWXQMZ2U"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595040,"version":0},"$loki":144},{"itemID":1809,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":172,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-35076-4_2","volume":"344","place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","pages":"9-18","ISBN":"978-3-642-35075-7 978-3-642-35076-4","date":"2012","extra":"00000","accessDate":"2018-04-13T11:03:03Z","libraryCatalog":"CrossRef","language":"en","abstractNote":"Spam and anti-spam techniques are part of email since its birth. Spam is electronic garbage with no anticipating recipient and almost always deleted. In 2010, around 89% of all emails were spam, resulting in an estimated 260 billion spam emails sent every single day. Most of the current anti-spamming systems focus on incoming spam but these messages still travel the internet world and waste bandwidth, storage and processing resources. This research proposes a collaborative outgoing anti-spam technique to reduce the spread of spam on the internet. The technique targets outgoing emails and its use would free the internet from 260 billion spam a day. During real-time experiment, it blocked 99.95% of the total spam generated with 99.57% elimination at sender side.","title":"COAT: Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique","bookTitle":"Advances in Information Technology","shortTitle":"COAT","creators":[{"firstName":"Borworn","lastName":"Papasratorn","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Nipon","lastName":"Charoenkitkarn","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Kittichai","lastName":"Lavangnananda","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Wichian","lastName":"Chutimaskul","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Vajirasak","lastName":"Vanijja","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Ahmad","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Whitworth","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T11:03:03Z","dateModified":"2018-05-31T17:28:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NDJDH67J","attachments":[{"key":"C476TI88","version":277,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://brianwhitworth.com/2012IAIT-COAT.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-13T11:03:01Z","title":"Ahmad and Whitworth - 2012 - COAT Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique.pdf","parentItem":"NDJDH67J","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ahmad and Whitworth - 2012 - COAT Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T11:03:01Z","dateModified":"2018-04-13T11:03:03Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1809,"key":"NDJDH67J"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595062,"version":0},"$loki":145},{"itemID":1808,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":277,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://brianwhitworth.com/2012IAIT-COAT.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-13T11:03:01Z","title":"Ahmad and Whitworth - 2012 - COAT Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique.pdf","parentItem":"NDJDH67J","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ahmad and Whitworth - 2012 - COAT Collaborative Outgoing Anti-spam Technique.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-04-13T11:03:01Z","dateModified":"2018-04-13T11:03:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/C476TI88","itemID":1808,"key":"C476TI88"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595064,"version":0},"$loki":146},{"itemID":1839,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":172,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"11","date":"2009","extra":"00001","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"Spam mitigation can be broadly classiﬁed into two main approaches: a) centralized security infrastructures that rely on a limited number of trusted monitors to detect and report malicious trafﬁc; and b) highly distributed systems that leverage the experiences of multiple nodes within distinct trust domains.

A variant of recommender systems that generates recommendations from a set of trusted people is recently getting more attention in social networks. However, people are concerned about their privacy as the information revealed in recommender systems, particularly in social networks, can be misused easily. A way to eliminate the privacy risks is to make the privacy-sensitive data inaccessible by means of encryption. While the private data is inaccessible to any outsiders and the server, the same functionality of the system can be achieved by processing the encrypted data. Unfortunately, the efficiency of processing encrypted data constitutes a big challenge. In this paper, we present a privacy-enhanced recommender system in a social trust network, which is designed to be highly efficient. The cryptographic protocol for generating recommendations is based on homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation techniques.

In this research, we aim to address some critical issues related to privacy protection: Would the highest privacy settings guarantee a secure protection? Given the open nature of social networking sites, is it possible to manage one's privacy protection? With the diversity of one's social media friends, how can one figure out an effective approach to balance between vulnerability and privacy? We present a novel way to define a vulnerable friend from an individual user's perspective is dependent on whether or not the user's friends' privacy settings protect the friend and the individual's network of friends (which includes the user). As a single vulnerable friend in a user's social network might place all friends at risk, we resort to experiments and observe how much security an individual user can improve by unfriending a vulnerable friend. We also show how privacy weakens if newly accepted friends are unguarded or unprotected. This work provides a large-scale evaluation of new security and privacy indexes using a Facebook dataset. We present and discuss a new perspective for reasoning about social networking security. When a user accepts a new friend, the user should ensure that the new friend is not an increased security risk with the potential of negatively impacting the entire friend network. Additionally, by leveraging the indexes proposed and employing new strategies for unfriending vulnerable friends, it is possible to further improve security and privacy without changing the social networking site's existing architecture.","title":"Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","creators":[{"firstName":"Pritam","lastName":"Gundecha","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Barbier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Huan","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"privacy","type":1},{"tag":"social network","type":1},{"tag":"vulnerability","type":1}],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T14:19:06Z","dateModified":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CQ2RJFF3","attachments":[{"key":"7MGY7XVZ","version":123,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2020489&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","title":"Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf","parentItem":"CQ2RJFF3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","dateModified":"2018-05-24T14:19:08Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1886,"key":"CQ2RJFF3"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595188,"version":0},"$loki":161},{"itemID":1887,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":123,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2020489&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","title":"Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf","parentItem":"CQ2RJFF3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T14:19:07Z","dateModified":"2018-05-24T14:19:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7MGY7XVZ","itemID":1887,"key":"7MGY7XVZ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595188,"version":0},"$loki":162},{"itemID":1893,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":369,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Cho et al. - 2016 - Privacy and Social Capital in Online Social Networ.pdf","parentItem":"74CBCPBX","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cho et al. - 2016 - Privacy and Social Capital in Online Social Networ.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T15:57:38Z","dateModified":"2018-05-31T13:14:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/KTMNZ3FS","itemID":1893,"key":"KTMNZ3FS"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595204,"version":0},"$loki":164},{"itemID":1895,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2815595","volume":"48","issue":"2","pages":"28:1–28:40","publicationTitle":"ACM Comput.

Even if substantial research effort has been dedicated to addressing trust-based mechanisms or trust metrics (or computation) in diverse contexts, prior work has not clearly solved the issue of how to model and quantify trust with sufficient detail and context-based adequateness. The issue of trust quantification has become more complicated as we have the need to derive trust from complex, composite networks that may involve four distinct layers of communication protocols, information exchange, social interactions, and cognitive motivations. In addition, the diverse application domains require different aspects of trust for decision making such as emotional, logical, and relational trust. This survey aims to outline the foundations of trust models for applications in these contexts in terms of the concept of trust, trust assessment, trust constructs, trust scales, trust properties, trust formulation, and applications of trust. We discuss how different components of trust can be mapped to different layers of a complex, composite network; applicability of trust metrics and models; research challenges; and future work directions.","title":"A Survey on Trust Modeling","creators":[{"firstName":"Jin-Hee","lastName":"Cho","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Chan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sibel","lastName":"Adali","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"composite trust","type":1},{"tag":"decision making","type":1},{"tag":"trust","type":1},{"tag":"Trust modeling","type":1},{"tag":"trustee","type":1},{"tag":"trustor","type":1}],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T16:20:20Z","dateModified":"2018-06-07T16:36:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/U76SQWFE","attachments":[{"key":"M242ED7C","version":18,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2815595&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-24T16:20:22Z","title":"Cho et al_2015_A Survey on Trust Modeling.pdf","parentItem":"U76SQWFE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cho et al_2015_A Survey on Trust Modeling.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T16:20:22Z","dateModified":"2018-05-24T16:20:22Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1895,"key":"U76SQWFE"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595224,"version":0},"$loki":165},{"itemID":1896,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":18,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2815595&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-24T16:20:22Z","title":"Cho et al_2015_A Survey on Trust Modeling.pdf","parentItem":"U76SQWFE","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cho et al_2015_A Survey on Trust Modeling.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T16:20:22Z","dateModified":"2018-05-24T16:20:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/M242ED7C","itemID":1896,"key":"M242ED7C"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595224,"version":0},"$loki":166},{"itemID":1899,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":78,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx5/4416742/4416743/04416865.pdf?tp=&arnumber=4416865&isnumber=4416743","accessDate":"2018-05-24T16:23:51Z","title":"Hussain et al_2007_An overview of the interpretations of trust and reputation.pdf","parentItem":"AC5H622N","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hussain et al_2007_An overview of the interpretations of trust and reputation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-24T16:23:51Z","dateModified":"2018-05-24T16:23:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/3HSENEF7","itemID":1899,"key":"3HSENEF7"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595248,"version":0},"$loki":168},{"itemID":1905,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1297231.1297235","series":"RecSys '07","place":"New York, NY, USA","publisher":"ACM","pages":"17–24","ISBN":"978-1-59593-730-8","date":"2007","extra":"01500","DOI":"10.1145/1297231.1297235","accessDate":"2018-05-25T08:23:44Z","libraryCatalog":"ACM Digital Library","abstractNote":"Recommender Systems based on Collaborative Filtering suggest to users items they might like.

In other words, since the probability of malicious behavior in WBSNs is increasing, it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of a person before trying to communicate with. Hence, it is desirable to ﬁnd out how much a person should trust another one in a network. The approach to answer this question is usually called trust inference. In this paper, we propose a new trust inference algorithm (Called RN-Trust) based on the resistive networks concept. The algorithm, in addition to being simple, resolves some problems of previously proposed approaches. The analysis of the algorithm demonstrates that RN-Trust calculates the trust values more accurately than previous approaches.","title":"Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using Resistive Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Taherian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Amini","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rasool","lastName":"Jalili","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-25T08:56:07Z","dateModified":"2018-05-25T08:56:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/LQN42QTF","attachments":[{"key":"E73WV7MN","version":299,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.723.4567&rep=rep1&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-25T08:56:05Z","title":"Taherian et al. - 2008 - Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using.pdf","parentItem":"LQN42QTF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Taherian et al. - 2008 - Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-25T08:56:05Z","dateModified":"2018-05-25T08:56:07Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1908,"key":"LQN42QTF"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595280,"version":0},"$loki":171},{"itemID":1907,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":299,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.723.4567&rep=rep1&type=pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-25T08:56:05Z","title":"Taherian et al. - 2008 - Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using.pdf","parentItem":"LQN42QTF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Taherian et al. - 2008 - Trust Inference in Web-Based Social Networks Using.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-25T08:56:05Z","dateModified":"2018-05-25T08:56:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/E73WV7MN","itemID":1907,"key":"E73WV7MN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595280,"version":0},"$loki":172},{"itemID":1910,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6689990/","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"29-36","ISBN":"978-0-7695-5145-6 978-1-4799-2902-3","date":"11/2013","extra":"00011","DOI":"10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.5","accessDate":"2018-05-25T09:18:24Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Social web permits users to acquire information from anonymous people around the world.

Users often have differing experiences with a WS. While trust in a WS is multi-faceted and consists of security and behavioral aspects, our focus in this paper is on the latter. We adopt a formal model for trust in a WS, which meets many of our intuitions about trustworthy WSs. We hypothesize predictors of a positive experience with a WS and conduct a small pilot study to explore correlations between subjects’ experiences with WSs in a composition and the predictor values for those WSs. Furthermore, we show how we may derive trust for compositions from trust models of individual services. We conclude by presenting and evaluating a novel framework, called Wisp, that utilizes the trust models and, in combination with any WS composition tool, chooses compositions to deploy that are deemed most trustworthy.","title":"Integrating Behavioral Trust in Web Service Compositions","creators":[{"firstName":"Sharon","lastName":"Paradesi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Prashant","lastName":"Doshi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sonu","lastName":"Swaika","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["46UMXUST"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-28T12:26:57Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:38:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JZ2E7FLD","attachments":[{"key":"V9SQFANX","version":19,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Paradesi et al. - 2009 - Integrating Behavioral Trust in Web Service Compos.pdf","parentItem":"JZ2E7FLD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Paradesi et al. - 2009 - Integrating Behavioral Trust in Web Service Compos.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-28T12:26:56Z","dateModified":"2018-05-28T12:26:58Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1944,"key":"JZ2E7FLD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595338,"version":0},"$loki":179},{"itemID":1943,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":19,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Paradesi et al. - 2009 - Integrating Behavioral Trust in Web Service Compos.pdf","parentItem":"JZ2E7FLD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Paradesi et al. - 2009 - Integrating Behavioral Trust in Web Service Compos.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-28T12:26:56Z","dateModified":"2018-05-28T12:26:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/V9SQFANX","itemID":1943,"key":"V9SQFANX"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595338,"version":0},"$loki":180},{"itemID":1946,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":8,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-02247-0_22","volume":"5535","place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","pages":"223-234","ISBN":"978-3-642-02246-3 978-3-642-02247-0","date":"2009","extra":"00000","accessDate":"2018-05-28T13:33:55Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"User modeling systems have been inﬂuenced by the overspread of Web 2.0 and social networks.

Such systems are the so-called “social recommender systems”. The idea at the base of social recommender systems is that the recommendation of content should follow user’s preferences while social network just represents a group of users joined by some kind of voluntary relation and does not reﬂect any preference. We claim that social network is a very important source of information to proﬁle users. Moving from theories in social psychology which describe inﬂuence dynamics among individuals, we state that joining in a network with other people exposes individuals to social dynamics which can inﬂuence their attitudes, behaviours and preferences.","title":"SoNARS: A Social Networks-Based Algorithm for Social Recommender Systems","bookTitle":"User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization","shortTitle":"SoNARS","creators":[{"firstName":"Geert-Jan","lastName":"Houben","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Gord","lastName":"McCalla","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pianesi","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Zancanaro","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Carmagnola","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fabiana","lastName":"Vernero","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pierluigi","lastName":"Grillo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-05-28T13:33:55Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T17:47:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/GPN6D2I6","attachments":[{"key":"J96562T3","version":352,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-02247-0_22.pdf","accessDate":"2018-05-28T13:33:53Z","title":"Carmagnola et al. - 2009 - SoNARS A Social Networks-Based Algorithm for Soci.pdf","parentItem":"GPN6D2I6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Carmagnola et al. - 2009 - SoNARS A Social Networks-Based Algorithm for Soci.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

One of the fundamental challenges in distributed reputation management is to understand vulnerabilities and develop mechanisms that can minimize the potential damages to a system by malicious nodes. In this paper, we identify three vulnerabilities that are detrimental to decentralized reputation management and propose TrustGuard − a safeguard framework for providing a highly dependable and yet eﬃcient reputation system. First, we provide a dependable trust model and a set of formal methods to handle strategic malicious nodes that continuously change their behavior to gain unfair advantages in the system. Second, a transaction based reputation system must cope with the vulnerability that malicious nodes may misuse the system by ﬂooding feedbacks with fake transactions. Third, but not least, we identify the importance of ﬁltering out dishonest feedbacks when computing reputation-based trust of a node, including the feedbacks ﬁled by malicious nodes through collusion. Our experiments show that, comparing with existing reputation systems, our framework is highly dependable and eﬀective in countering malicious nodes regarding strategic oscillating behavior, ﬂooding malevolent feedbacks with fake transactions, and dishonest feedbacks.","title":"TrustGuard: countering vulnerabilities in reputation management for decentralized overlay networks","shortTitle":"TrustGuard","creators":[{"firstName":"Mudhakar","lastName":"Srivatsa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xiong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:47:07Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:47:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NIZ9HLEG","attachments":[{"key":"UBIP7DFZ","version":19,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/disl/SGuard/trustguard/trustguard.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:47:06Z","title":"Srivatsa et al. - 2005 - TrustGuard countering vulnerabilities in reputati.pdf","parentItem":"NIZ9HLEG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Srivatsa et al. - 2005 - TrustGuard countering vulnerabilities in reputati.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:47:06Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:47:08Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1982,"key":"NIZ9HLEG"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595426,"version":0},"$loki":191},{"itemID":1981,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":19,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/disl/SGuard/trustguard/trustguard.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:47:06Z","title":"Srivatsa et al. - 2005 - TrustGuard countering vulnerabilities in reputati.pdf","parentItem":"NIZ9HLEG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Srivatsa et al. - 2005 - TrustGuard countering vulnerabilities in reputati.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:47:06Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:47:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/UBIP7DFZ","itemID":1981,"key":"UBIP7DFZ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595426,"version":0},"$loki":192},{"itemID":1984,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1541943/","volume":"9","issue":"6","pages":"24-34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","ISSN":"1089-7801","date":"11/2005","extra":"00529","DOI":"10.1109/MIC.2005.136","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:48:53Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Trusted P2P Transactions with Fuzzy Reputation Aggregation","creators":[{"name":"Shanshan Song","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"Kai Hwang","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"Runfang Zhou","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"Yu-Kwong Kwok","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["9P6QWN2J"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:48:53Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:48:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/XWXIQXF6","attachments":[{"key":"UG856ERP","version":19,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://gridsec.usc.edu/files/TR/Song_IC_2005.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:48:52Z","title":"Shanshan Song et al. - 2005 - Trusted P2P Transactions with Fuzzy Reputation Agg.pdf","parentItem":"XWXIQXF6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Shanshan Song et al. - 2005 - Trusted P2P Transactions with Fuzzy Reputation Agg.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:48:52Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:48:54Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1984,"key":"XWXIQXF6"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595440,"version":0},"$loki":193},{"itemID":1983,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":19,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://gridsec.usc.edu/files/TR/Song_IC_2005.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:48:52Z","title":"Shanshan Song et al. - 2005 - Trusted P2P Transactions with Fuzzy Reputation Agg.pdf","parentItem":"XWXIQXF6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Shanshan Song et al. - 2005 - Trusted P2P Transactions with Fuzzy Reputation Agg.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:48:52Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:48:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/UG856ERP","itemID":1983,"key":"UG856ERP"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595442,"version":0},"$loki":194},{"itemID":1986,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":8,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"34","date":"2008","extra":"00013","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"To build an efficient reputation system for peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, we need fast mechanisms to aggregate peer evaluations and to disseminate updated scores to a large number of peer nodes. Unfortunately, unstructured P2P networks are short of secure hashing and fast lookup mechanisms as in structured P2P systems like the DHT-based Chord. In light of this shortcoming, we propose a gossiping mechanism to support unstructured P2P communications. This paper reports the design principles and performance results of a GossipTrust system. Gossip-based communications are shown effective to support fast peer scoring and distribution. Gossiping enables light-weight aggregation of local scores and spreading of updated scores to all nodes in O(log2 n) time, where n is the P2P network size.","title":"Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Runfang","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:50:23Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T17:01:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EVNQSIML","attachments":[{"key":"9UDKZ76E","version":249,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://gridsec.usc.edu/files/publications/TKDE-submitted-Jan3-2007-Zhou-Hwang-Cai.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:50:22Z","title":"Zhou - Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructure.pdf","parentItem":"EVNQSIML","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhou - Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructure.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:50:22Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:50:23Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1986,"key":"EVNQSIML"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595454,"version":0},"$loki":195},{"itemID":1985,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":249,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://gridsec.usc.edu/files/publications/TKDE-submitted-Jan3-2007-Zhou-Hwang-Cai.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:50:22Z","title":"Zhou - Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructure.pdf","parentItem":"EVNQSIML","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhou - Gossip-Based Reputation Management for Unstructure.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:50:22Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:50:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/9UDKZ76E","itemID":1985,"key":"9UDKZ76E"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595454,"version":0},"$loki":196},{"itemID":1988,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":8,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1557019.1557067","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"397","ISBN":"978-1-60558-495-9","date":"2009","extra":"00720","DOI":"10.1145/1557019.1557067","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:55:10Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Collaborative ﬁltering is the most popular approach to build recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. However, it cannot make recommendations for so-called cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In addition, these methods do not know how conﬁdent they are in their recommendations. Trust-based recommendation methods assume the additional knowledge of a trust network among users and can better deal with cold start users, since users only need to be simply connected to the trust network. On the other hand, the sparsity of the user item ratings forces the trustbased approach to consider ratings of indirect neighbors that are only weakly trusted, which may decrease its precision. In order to ﬁnd a good trade-oﬀ, we propose a random walk model combining the trust-based and the collaborative ﬁltering approach for recommendation. The random walk model allows us to deﬁne and to measure the conﬁdence of a recommendation. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset and compared our model with existing trust-based and collaborative ﬁltering methods.","title":"TrustWalker: a random walk model for combining trust-based and item-based recommendation","shortTitle":"<i>TrustWalker</i>","creators":[{"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Jamali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Ester","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:55:10Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T23:38:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4GAZV7R9","attachments":[{"key":"R35UJQNM","version":19,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ester/papers/KDD-2009-TrustWalker.final.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:55:09Z","title":"Jamali and Ester - 2009 - TrustWalker a random walk model for combining tru.pdf","parentItem":"4GAZV7R9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Jamali and Ester - 2009 - TrustWalker a random walk model for combining tru.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:55:09Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:55:35Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1988,"key":"4GAZV7R9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595464,"version":0},"$loki":197},{"itemID":1987,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":19,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ester/papers/KDD-2009-TrustWalker.final.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-08T16:55:09Z","title":"Jamali and Ester - 2009 - TrustWalker a random walk model for combining tru.pdf","parentItem":"4GAZV7R9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Jamali and Ester - 2009 - TrustWalker a random walk model for combining tru.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-08T16:55:09Z","dateModified":"2018-06-08T16:55:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/R35UJQNM","itemID":1987,"key":"R35UJQNM"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595466,"version":0},"$loki":198},{"itemID":1990,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1772690.1772727","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"351","ISBN":"978-1-60558-799-8","date":"2010","extra":"00397","DOI":"10.1145/1772690.1772727","accessDate":"2018-06-08T17:09:56Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Privacy is an enormous problem in online social networking sites.

In this paper, we closely examine the accuracy of IP-cluster-based approaches to understand their effectiveness and fundamental limitations. Based on such understanding, we propose and implement a new clustering approach that considers both network origin and DNS information, and incorporate it with SpamAssassin, a popular spam ﬁltering system widely used today. Applying our approach to a 7-month email trace collected at a large university department, we can reduce the false negative rate by 50% compared with directly applying various public IP-based blacklists without increasing the false positive rate. Furthermore, using honeypot email accounts and real user accounts, we show that our approach can capture 30% - 50% of the spam emails that slip through SpamAssassin today.","title":"On Network-level Clusters for Spam Detection","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhiyun","lastName":"Qian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Z Morley","lastName":"Mao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yinglian","lastName":"Xie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["728D65LR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:00:23Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:02:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JHBWXIDB","attachments":[{"key":"WUDZ6XAD","version":19,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Qian et al. - On Network-level Clusters for Spam Detection.pdf","parentItem":"JHBWXIDB","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Qian et al. - On Network-level Clusters for Spam Detection.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:00:21Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:00:24Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":1997,"key":"JHBWXIDB"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595518,"version":0},"$loki":203},{"itemID":1996,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":19,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Qian et al. - On Network-level Clusters for Spam Detection.pdf","parentItem":"JHBWXIDB","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Qian et al. - On Network-level Clusters for Spam Detection.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:00:21Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:00:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WUDZ6XAD","itemID":1996,"key":"WUDZ6XAD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595522,"version":0},"$loki":204},{"itemID":1999,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"5","date":"2014","extra":"00005","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"In this paper, we study how patient privacy could be compromised from electronic health records (EHRs), especially with the help of today’s information technologies.

Particularly, we show that (1) healthcare information could be collected by associating and aggregating information across multiple online sources including social networks, public records and search engines. Through attribution, inference and aggregation attacks, user identity and privacy are very vulnerable. (2) People are highly identiﬁable even when the attacker only possess inaccurate information. With real-world case study and experiments, we show that such attacks are valid and threatening.

However, in online social networks the low cost of link formation can lead to networks with heterogeneous relationship strengths (e.g., acquaintances and best friends mixed together). In this case, the binary friendship indicator provides only a coarse representation of relationship information. In this work, we develop an unsupervised model to estimate relationship strength from interaction activity (e.g., communication, tagging) and user similarity. More speciﬁcally, we formulate a link-based latent variable model, along with a coordinate ascent optimization procedure for the inference. We evaluate our approach on real-world data from Facebook and LinkedIn, showing that the estimated link weights result in higher autocorrelation and lead to improved classiﬁcation accuracy.","title":"Modeling relationship strength in online social networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Rongjing","lastName":"Xiang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Neville","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Monica","lastName":"Rogati","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["UASSXJNU"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:20:05Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:20:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/L6MMH7L3","attachments":[{"key":"47NEQV43","version":85,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/neville/papers/xiang-neville-www2010.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-10T12:20:02Z","title":"Xiang et al. - 2010 - Modeling relationship strength in online social ne.pdf","parentItem":"L6MMH7L3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Xiang et al. - 2010 - Modeling relationship strength in online social ne.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:20:02Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:20:05Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2001,"key":"L6MMH7L3"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595570,"version":0},"$loki":207},{"itemID":2000,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":85,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/neville/papers/xiang-neville-www2010.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-10T12:20:02Z","title":"Xiang et al. - 2010 - Modeling relationship strength in online social ne.pdf","parentItem":"L6MMH7L3","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Xiang et al. - 2010 - Modeling relationship strength in online social ne.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-10T12:20:02Z","dateModified":"2018-06-10T12:20:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/47NEQV43","itemID":2000,"key":"47NEQV43"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595570,"version":0},"$loki":208},{"itemID":2011,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17310956","volume":"82","pages":"63-76","publicationTitle":"Future Generation Computer Systems","ISSN":"0167-739X","date":"May 1, 2018","extra":"00000","journalAbbreviation":"Future Generation Computer Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.future.2017.12.030","accessDate":"2018-06-11T13:12:45Z","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","abstractNote":"Users are not often aware of privacy risks and disclose information in online social networks. They do not consider the audience that will have access to it or the risk that the information continues to spread and may reach an unexpected audience. Moreover, not all users have the same perception of risk. To overcome these issues, we propose a Privacy Risk Score (PRS) that: (1) estimates the reachability of an user’s sharing action based on the distance between the user and the potential audience; (2) is described in levels to adjust to the risk perception of individuals; (3) does not require the explicit interaction of individuals since it considers information flows; and (4) can be approximated by centrality metrics for scenarios where there is no access to data about information flows. In this case, if there is access to the network structure, the results show that global metrics such as closeness have a high degree of correlation with PRS. Otherwise, local and social centrality metrics based on ego-networks provide a suitable approximation to PRS. The results in real social networks confirm that local and social centrality metrics based on degree perform well in estimating the privacy risk of users.","title":"Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics","creators":[{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Alemany","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"E.","lastName":"del Val","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Alberola","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"García-Fornes","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Privacy","type":1},{"tag":"Social networks","type":1},{"tag":"Information sharing","type":1}],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T13:12:45Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T13:12:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4JW8N6FY","attachments":[{"key":"BZJ38VUD","version":276,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0167739X17310956/1-s2.0-S0167739X17310956-main.pdf?_tid=8c9eec2f-06b9-48d4-8617-395750d766a4&acdnat=1528722941_696353c98d09c17eb9e14f110625b2a5","accessDate":"2018-06-11T13:12:50Z","title":"Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf","parentItem":"4JW8N6FY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T13:12:50Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T13:12:51Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2011,"key":"4JW8N6FY"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595602,"version":0},"$loki":211},{"itemID":2012,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":276,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0167739X17310956/1-s2.0-S0167739X17310956-main.pdf?_tid=8c9eec2f-06b9-48d4-8617-395750d766a4&acdnat=1528722941_696353c98d09c17eb9e14f110625b2a5","accessDate":"2018-06-11T13:12:50Z","title":"Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf","parentItem":"4JW8N6FY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T13:12:50Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T13:12:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BZJ38VUD","itemID":2012,"key":"BZJ38VUD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595602,"version":0},"$loki":212},{"itemID":2014,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"6","date":"2017","extra":"00000","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"Due to the tremendous growth in user population over online social networks (OSNs), interactive messaging trafﬁc has experienced exponential increase, which consequently elevates the privacy leakage. Malicious users may utilize camouﬂage, phishing and other unconventional techniques to lure ordinary users to reveal their sensitive attributes in their interactive messages, when they least expect that the other sides are malicious. Therefore, it is very important to identify malicious users quickly and successfully when socializing over OSNs. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving interactive messaging scheme by relying on user credibility, which characterizes users’ reputation through users’ social behaviors, and use the item response theory in psychometrics to assess the risk levels of users’ interactive messages. We have conducted extensive studies by sending interactive messages with sensitive attributes and have observed that the success rate of identifying malicious users based on user credibility is signiﬁcantly higher and our scheme can effectively lower the risk of privacy leakage in our interactive messaging system.","title":"A Privacy-preserving Interactive Messaging Scheme Based on Users Credibility over Online Social Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Mr Shunan","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dr Ying","lastName":"Cai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mrs Hongke","lastName":"Xia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["VJ5ZGL9W"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T13:30:27Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T13:30:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/PARX5GEI","attachments":[{"key":"XD9VWI2S","version":19,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zhang et al. - 2017 - A Privacy-preserving Interactive Messaging Scheme .pdf","parentItem":"PARX5GEI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang et al. - 2017 - A Privacy-preserving Interactive Messaging Scheme .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T13:30:25Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T13:30:28Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2014,"key":"PARX5GEI"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595622,"version":0},"$loki":213},{"itemID":2013,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":19,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zhang et al. - 2017 - A Privacy-preserving Interactive Messaging Scheme .pdf","parentItem":"PARX5GEI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang et al. - 2017 - A Privacy-preserving Interactive Messaging Scheme .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T13:30:25Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T13:30:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/XD9VWI2S","itemID":2013,"key":"XD9VWI2S"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595622,"version":0},"$loki":214},{"itemID":2017,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"1-13","date":"April 2006","extra":"00346","DOI":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2006.154","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","conferenceName":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications","abstractNote":"The performance of distributed networks depends on collaboration among distributed entities. To enhance security in distributed networks, such as ad hoc networks, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of participating entities since trust is the major driving force for collaboration. In this paper, we present a framework to quantitatively measure trust, model trust propagation, and defend trust evaluation systems against malicious attacks. In particular, we address the fundamental understanding of trust, quantitative trust metrics, mathematical properties of trust, dynamic properties of trust, and trust models. The attacks against trust evaluation are identified and defense techniques are developed. The proposed trust evaluation system is employed in ad hoc networks for securing ad hoc routing and assisting malicious node detection. The implementation is fully distributed. Simulations show that the proposed system can significantly improve network throughput as well as effectively detect malicious behaviors in ad hoc networks. Further, extensive simulations are performed to illustrate various attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed defense techniques.","title":"A trust evaluation framework in distributed networks: Vulnerability analysis and defense against attacks","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications","shortTitle":"A trust evaluation framework in distributed networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Y.

Firstly, we discuss research that aims to protect user data from the various attack vantage points including other users, advertisers, third party application developers, and the online social network provider itself. Next we cover social network inference of user attributes, locating hubs, and link prediction. Because online social networks are so saturated with sensitive information, network inference plays a major privacy role. As a response to the issues brought forth by client-server architectures, distributed social networks are discussed. We then cover the challenges that providers face in maintaining the proper operation of an online social network including minimizing spam messages, and reducing the number of sybil accounts. Finally, we present research in anonymizing social network data. This area is of particular interest in order to continue research in this ﬁeld both in academia and in industry.","title":"A Survey of Security and Privacy in Online Social Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Ed Novak Qun","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"aghiles"}],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T17:56:54Z","dateModified":"2018-10-18T10:00:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/PSEAP3W6","attachments":[{"key":"S856YTX7","version":20,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.cs.wm.edu/~liqun/paper/tr12-2.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-11T17:56:52Z","title":"Li - A Survey of Security and Privacy in Online Social .pdf","parentItem":"PSEAP3W6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Li - A Survey of Security and Privacy in Online Social .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T17:56:52Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T17:56:54Z"}],"notes":[{"key":"4KIECQQE","version":182,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"PSEAP3W6","note":"<p><strong>Extracted Annotations (17/11/2018 à 23:37:58)</strong></p>\n<p>\"degree, betweeness, closeness, eigenvector centrality, and page rank centrality\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S856YTX7?page=14\">Li 2012:45</a>)</p>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-17T22:37:58Z","dateModified":"2018-11-17T22:39:07Z"}],"itemID":2020,"key":"PSEAP3W6"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595658,"version":0},"$loki":217},{"itemID":2019,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":20,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.cs.wm.edu/~liqun/paper/tr12-2.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-11T17:56:52Z","title":"Li - A Survey of Security and Privacy in Online Social .pdf","parentItem":"PSEAP3W6","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Li - A Survey of Security and Privacy in Online Social .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-11T17:56:52Z","dateModified":"2018-06-11T17:56:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/S856YTX7","itemID":2019,"key":"S856YTX7"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595660,"version":0},"$loki":218},{"itemID":2024,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":173,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-16567-2_15","volume":"6430","place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","pages":"203-215","ISBN":"978-3-642-16566-5 978-3-642-16567-2","date":"2010","extra":"00000 \nDOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-16567-2_15","accessDate":"2018-06-12T00:46:08Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"As online social networks (OSN) attempt to mimic real life social networks, we have made progress towards using OSNs to provide us with data to allow for richer and more robust online communications. In this paper, we present a novel approach towards socially-aware email. Currently, email provides too little control to the recipient. Our approach, dubbed SoEmail, provides social context to messages using an OSN’s underlying social graph. This not only gives the recipient control over who can message her, but it also provides her with an understanding of where the message originated from, socially. Furthermore, users who do not wish to use the built-in social aspect of SoEmail, can send and receive emails without any changes to their behavior. The modiﬁcations we made to the email application to provide this social context are not invasive and can be easily ignored by any existing email client. We built SoEmail on top of an existing framework, known as Davis Social Links, which allows SoEmail to be completely agnostic about the underlying OSN. We created a web-based, standards-based web client for SoEmail using Facebook and Gmail as the underlying systems which has been released for public use and has had a good adoption rate.","title":"Social Email: A Framework and Application for More Socially-Aware Communications","bookTitle":"Social Informatics","shortTitle":"Social Email","creators":[{"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"Bolc","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Makowski","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Wierzbicki","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Tran","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Rowe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.

decisions; however, it is a challenge for systems to map trust into computational models because of its subjective properties. Also, many online social communities are sparsely connected. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce mechanisms which can infer indirect trust among participants who are not directly connected. We provide a survey of existing trust management systems for online social communities. We also list four types of attacks, and analyze existing systems’ vulnerabilities. Compared with previous surveys, our survey takes trust modeling, trust inference, and attacks into account. Although there are several survey papers about global trust/reputation related attacks, the main contribution of this paper is that we consider trust inference and potential local trust related attacks.","title":"A survey of trust management systems for online social communities – Trust modeling, trust inference and attacks","creators":[{"firstName":"Yefeng","lastName":"Ruan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arjan","lastName":"Durresi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Attack","type":1},{"tag":"Online social communities","type":1},{"tag":"Online trust","type":1},{"tag":"Trust management","type":1}],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7Z4XSEP7"]},"dateAdded":"2018-06-12T14:14:11Z","dateModified":"2018-06-12T14:18:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CTFZ26SF","attachments":[{"key":"P7DN42WS","version":20,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0950705116301393/1-s2.0-S0950705116301393-main.pdf?_tid=2bccbcfd-df32-43a8-816a-bcc64f1d2625&acdnat=1528813290_8c2646d28efa649bda127a371e43c70c","accessDate":"2018-06-12T14:18:35Z","title":"Ruan and Durresi - 2016 - A survey of trust management systems for online so.pdf","parentItem":"CTFZ26SF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ruan and Durresi - 2016 - A survey of trust management systems for online so.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-12T14:18:35Z","dateModified":"2018-06-12T14:18:59Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2058,"key":"CTFZ26SF"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595736,"version":0},"$loki":230},{"itemID":2071,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":20,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0950705116301393/1-s2.0-S0950705116301393-main.pdf?_tid=2bccbcfd-df32-43a8-816a-bcc64f1d2625&acdnat=1528813290_8c2646d28efa649bda127a371e43c70c","accessDate":"2018-06-12T14:18:35Z","title":"Ruan and Durresi - 2016 - A survey of trust management systems for online so.pdf","parentItem":"CTFZ26SF","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ruan and Durresi - 2016 - A survey of trust management systems for online so.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-12T14:18:35Z","dateModified":"2018-06-12T14:18:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/P7DN42WS","itemID":2071,"key":"P7DN42WS"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595736,"version":0},"$loki":231},{"itemID":2106,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"journalArticle","date":"2015","extra":"00000","libraryCatalog":"Google Scholar","title":"Trust-ware: A Methodology to Analyze, Design, and Secure Trust and Reputation Systems","shortTitle":"Trust-ware","creators":[{"firstName":"David Fraga","lastName":"Aydillo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"José Manuel Moya","lastName":"Fernández","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zorana","lastName":"Bankovic","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-12T14:21:47Z","dateModified":"2018-06-12T14:21:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/5CL4NLZU","attachments":[{"key":"W7FZN9MD","version":20,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://oa.upm.es/id/eprint/39780/contents","accessDate":"2018-06-12T14:21:49Z","title":"Aydillo et al_2015_Trust-ware.pdf","parentItem":"5CL4NLZU","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Aydillo et al_2015_Trust-ware.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

The development of D2D is driven by mobile operators to harvest short range communications for improving network performance and supporting proximity-based services. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental and interrelated aspects of D2D communication, security and privacy, which are essential for the adoption and deployment of D2D. We present an extensive review of the state-of-the-art solutions for enhancing security and privacy in D2D communication. By summarizing the challenges, requirements, and features of different proposals, we identify lessons to be learned from existing studies and derive a set of “best practices.” The primary goal of our work is to equip researchers and developers with a better understanding of the underlying problems and the potential solutions for D2D security and privacy. To inspire follow-up research, we identify open problems and highlight future directions with regard to system and communication design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst comprehensive review to address the fundamental security and privacy issues in D2D communication.","title":"Security and Privacy in Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication: A Review","shortTitle":"Security and Privacy in Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication","creators":[{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Haus","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Waqas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aaron Yi","lastName":"Ding","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sasu","lastName":"Tarkoma","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Ott","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["TFCFA8KG"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:17:08Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T09:17:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/Z8RJB6RD","attachments":[{"key":"USRN64MD","version":20,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Haus et al. - 2017 - Security and Privacy in Device-to-Device (D2D) Com.pdf","parentItem":"Z8RJB6RD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Haus et al. - 2017 - Security and Privacy in Device-to-Device (D2D) Com.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:17:05Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T09:17:08Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2165,"key":"Z8RJB6RD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595788,"version":0},"$loki":240},{"itemID":2164,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":20,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Haus et al. - 2017 - Security and Privacy in Device-to-Device (D2D) Com.pdf","parentItem":"Z8RJB6RD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Haus et al. - 2017 - Security and Privacy in Device-to-Device (D2D) Com.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:17:05Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T09:17:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/USRN64MD","itemID":2164,"key":"USRN64MD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595788,"version":0},"$loki":241},{"itemID":2167,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7993802/","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"321-325","ISBN":"978-1-5090-4749-9","date":"7/2017","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/ICUFN.2017.7993802","accessDate":"2018-06-13T09:17:27Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"With the growth of sharing economy, P2P resource sharing services are combined with social networks for improving user experience and giving more trustworthiness to users. For trust management, many P2P resource sharing services adopt feedbackbased reputation system. Since peers in services have their social relationship in the community, reputation includes not only trust related to services but also subjective social trust which causes bias of reputation. In this paper, we propose the method that objectifies feedback-based trust by removing social trust from rating points. We conduct simulation and verify the proposed method can objectify feedback-based trust preciously with optimized parameters by using lambda square discrepancy measure.","title":"Objectification of feedback based trust evaluation considering social relationship in sharing economy","creators":[{"firstName":"Jaewon","lastName":"Ahn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hyeontaek","lastName":"Oh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hong-Shik","lastName":"Park","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:17:27Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T09:17:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/PXHD2CKR","attachments":[{"key":"TENDB3GF","version":20,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ahn et al. - 2017 - Objectification of feedback based trust evaluation.pdf","parentItem":"PXHD2CKR","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ahn et al. - 2017 - Objectification of feedback based trust evaluation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:17:25Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T09:17:27Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2167,"key":"PXHD2CKR"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595824,"version":0},"$loki":242},{"itemID":2166,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":20,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ahn et al. - 2017 - Objectification of feedback based trust evaluation.pdf","parentItem":"PXHD2CKR","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ahn et al. - 2017 - Objectification of feedback based trust evaluation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:17:25Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T09:17:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/TENDB3GF","itemID":2166,"key":"TENDB3GF"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595824,"version":0},"$loki":243},{"itemID":2173,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10462-017-9583-1","publicationTitle":"Artificial Intelligence Review","ISSN":"0269-2821, 1573-7462","date":"2017-10-22","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1007/s10462-017-9583-1","accessDate":"2018-06-13T09:32:15Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Formation of online social network (OSN) strongly depends on the quality of relationships between its agents. Such relationships are affected by a host of factors; trust is one of them. To enhance the quality of relationships in such networks, it is important to ﬁnd a mechanism to predict the degree of trust among participating agents since trust is the major driving force for initiating and developing social relationships. Although much effort has been made to develop quantitative techniques to obtain trust value, there is a lack of coherent classiﬁcation of such techniques to achieve a macro vision of trust prediction models and identify their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we proposed TP-TA, an analytical framework which consists of three main components: First, classiﬁcation of various existing trust prediction models in terms of trust aspects in the context of OSNs. Besides, main ideas, prospects, and challenges of each approach are highlighted for further research in this ﬁeld. Second, deﬁning general criteria to analyze our proposed classiﬁcation. Finally, we illustrate a qualitative comparison between each approach which is a guide to understanding their superiority to one another. This framework could lead to an efﬁcient selection of trust prediction techniques based on the nature of the target OSN and the intended trust type.","title":"TP-TA: a comparative analytical framework for trust prediction models in online social networks based on trust aspects","shortTitle":"TP-TA","creators":[{"firstName":"Aynaz","lastName":"Khaksari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"MohammadReza","lastName":"Keyvanpour","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"aghiles"}],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:32:15Z","dateModified":"2018-10-18T10:00:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/VJ7X83KN","attachments":[{"key":"529RQ5FC","version":214,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10462-017-9583-1.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-13T09:32:13Z","title":"Khaksari and Keyvanpour - 2017 - TP-TA a comparative analytical framework for trus.pdf","parentItem":"VJ7X83KN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Khaksari and Keyvanpour - 2017 - TP-TA a comparative analytical framework for trus.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:32:13Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T09:32:16Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2173,"key":"VJ7X83KN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595840,"version":0},"$loki":244},{"itemID":2172,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":214,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10462-017-9583-1.pdf","accessDate":"2018-06-13T09:32:13Z","title":"Khaksari and Keyvanpour - 2017 - TP-TA a comparative analytical framework for trus.pdf","parentItem":"VJ7X83KN","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Khaksari and Keyvanpour - 2017 - TP-TA a comparative analytical framework for trus.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:32:13Z","dateModified":"2018-06-13T09:32:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/529RQ5FC","itemID":2172,"key":"529RQ5FC"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595840,"version":0},"$loki":245},{"itemID":2175,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7906938/","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"62-69","ISBN":"978-1-5090-4379-8","date":"12/2016","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/PST.2016.7906938","accessDate":"2018-06-13T09:41:48Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Something in our mind does not always reflect with our fingers on keyboard and mouse, but we respect our blood which might be the way out of the wariness in usage of social media networks today. Social media networks are already the largest network among the population across our globe and for sure, it will not stop expanding its territory. Security vulnerabilities on the other side have been mounting in parallel. A comprehensive effort to change ourselves along with reversing the process or architecture of social media network sites might be the solution of this serious but unavoidable problem. We can create a trusted social media network model that will ensure trust level of a user to connect with other users. Users can trust each other based on the trust level. A lot of research has been done on trust model for social media networks and till now none is established effectively as most of them fail to capture user’s trustworthiness with full proof. In order to signpost user’s trustworthiness, we model trust with two components: i) Static Trust and ii) Dynamic Weight on Trust. Static Trust is captured by anti-anonymity process based on genealogical tree which will not be changed frequently. And Dynamic Weight on Trust is an algorithmic process to determine score based on predefined scoring scale that is applied on user’s genealogical tree and community members. Evaluation of the above model on selected user group is quite positive in taking decision for users when (i) connecting with new friends (ii) self-representing in trustworthy manner. Our proposed trust model fully eliminates anonymity in social media networks which will be a trusted zone for users.","title":"Dynamic Weight on Static Trust for trustworthy social media networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Mohammad Khaliqur","lastName":"Rahman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad Abdullah","lastName":"Adnan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"aghiles"}],"collections":["728D65LR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-13T09:41:48Z","dateModified":"2018-10-18T10:01:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/6R6SKKIG","attachments":[{"key":"XRJD58R6","version":20,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Rahman and Adnan -

Reputation is often considered as a collective measure of trustworthiness based on the referrals or ratings from members in a community. Reputation systems have been applied in various applications such as online service provision. However, reputation models do not reflect user’s quality of service (QoS) preferences and thus they might not be satisfied with the recommendations from others. In this paper, we propose a de-centralized reputation-based trust model that incorporates the user QoS preferences to select the best match Cloud Service Provider to process Big Data. Our trust model relies on three multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods including Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Weighted Product Method (WPM), and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). We conducted several experiments using simulated cloud environment to validate our trust model and assess the three MADM methods. The results show that the proposed model is pliable to users’ requirements and efficiently evaluate trust of cloud providers.","title":"De-Centralized Reputation-Based Trust Model to Discriminate between Cloud Providers Capable of Processing Big Data","creators":[{"firstName":"Hadeel T.

Trust can be used as a ﬁlter to the increasing ﬂow of information, experiences and opinions exchanged among users. In the absence of direct relations, trust inference algorithms can be exploited in order to estimate missing trust values. However, controversial situations can easily arise from the subjectivity of trust opinions, when the lack of agreement leads to ambiguity and uncertainty in the inferred trust. In this work, we propose a novel trust inference algorithm, named TrustZic, which aims at improving the performance of trust inference in controversial conditions by combining local and global trust aspects. The proposed approach is based on the use of global reputation values as node weights biasing a local trust inference process. Experimental evaluation has shown the signiﬁcance of our approach and its effectiveness in supporting trust decisions in critical situations characterized by a high level of controversy.","title":"Ontroversy-Aware Hybrid Trust Inference in Online Social

Social or trust network among users provides an additional information along with the ratings for improving the user reliability on the recommendation. However, in real world, trust data is sparse in nature. So, many algorithms are built for inferring trust. In this paper, we propose a new trust inference method based on the implicit inﬂuence information available in the existing trust network. This approach uses the transitivity property of the trust for trust propagation and scale-free complex network property to limit the propagation length in the network. In this regard, we deﬁne a new terminology, degree of trustworthiness for a user, which adds the global inﬂuence in the inferred trust. This process improves the recommendation accuracy from the existing trustbased recommendation and neighborhood based collaborative ﬁltering. Due to the availability of users preference from trust network which is absent in rating data, it also alleviates the very well-known cold start users problem of a recommender system. We evaluate the proposed approach on two established real world datasets and report the obtained results.","title":"Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item Recommendation","creators":[{"firstName":"Bithika","lastName":"Pal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mamata","lastName":"Jenamani","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["J284H5UK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:22:46Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T20:33:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EVDASNPA","attachments":[{"key":"J8RXG7YK","version":351,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pal and Jenamani - 2017 - Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item .pdf","parentItem":"EVDASNPA","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pal and Jenamani - 2017 - Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:22:44Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:22:47Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2580,"key":"EVDASNPA"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595982,"version":0},"$loki":267},{"itemID":2579,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":351,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pal and Jenamani - 2017 - Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item .pdf","parentItem":"EVDASNPA","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pal and Jenamani - 2017 - Trust Inference Using Implicit Influence for Item .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:22:44Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:22:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/J8RXG7YK","itemID":2579,"key":"J8RXG7YK"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088595984,"version":0},"$loki":268},{"itemID":2582,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"6","date":"2018","extra":"00000","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"To estimate the reliability of an unknown node in social networks, existing works involve as many opinions from other nodes as possible. Though this makes it possible to approximate the real property of the unknown nodes, the computational complexity increases as the scale of social networks getting bigger and bigger. We therefore propose a novel method which involve only limited number of social relations to predict the trustworthiness of the unknown nodes. The proposed method involves four rating prediction mechanisms: FM use the recommendation given by the most reliable recommender with the shortest trust propagation distance from the active user as the predicted rating, FMW weights the recommendation in FM, FA uses the mean value of recommendations with the shortest trust propagation distance from the active user as the predicted rating, and FAW weights recommendations in FA. The simulation results show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the rating prediction calculation, while the rating prediction losses are reasonable.","title":"Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users in Social Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Yuan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Donghai","lastName":"Guan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Asad Masood","lastName":"Khattak","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["J284H5UK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:23:37Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T20:33:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/N5B37YMG","attachments":[{"key":"ECRNEDDS","version":302,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Yuan et al. - 2018 - Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users .pdf","parentItem":"N5B37YMG","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yuan et al. - 2018 - Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:23:35Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:23:37Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2582,"key":"N5B37YMG"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596006,"version":0},"$loki":269},{"itemID":2581,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":302,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Yuan et al. - 2018 - Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users .pdf","parentItem":"N5B37YMG","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yuan et al. - 2018 - Recommending with Limited Number of Trusted Users .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:23:35Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:23:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/ECRNEDDS","itemID":2581,"key":"ECRNEDDS"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596006,"version":0},"$loki":270},{"itemID":2584,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8367265/","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"182-189","ISBN":"978-1-5386-3790-6","date":"12/2017","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/ISPA/IUCC.2017.00035","accessDate":"2018-06-14T10:24:43Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Detecting inﬂuential nodes and understanding their evolution patterns are very important for information diffusion in online social networks. Although some work has been done in literature, it is still not clear that: (1) how to measure the inﬂuential degree of nodes for information diffusion, and (2) how inﬂuential nodes evolve during the diffusion process. To address the two challenges, we identify an incremental approach to measuring users’ inﬂuential degrees, detecting local and global inﬂuential nodes, and analyzing their evolution patterns, for which we propose three methods to partition time window. The three methods are the uniform time window, the non-uniform time window, and the uniform retweets number window, respectively. We apply our model on real data set in Sina weibo and conduct extensive analyses, from which we gain several interesting ﬁndings. We also validate the effects of our method, by comparing the inﬂuence spread with our detected inﬂuential nodes as seeds, to other seed selection algorithms, which shows that our work has better performance.","title":"Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evolutionarily in Online Social Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Jiang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kenli","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["J284H5UK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:24:43Z","dateModified":"2018-06-15T21:05:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/UFI4CUZ7","attachments":[{"key":"958DZM8F","version":243,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wang et al. - 2017 - Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evol.pdf","parentItem":"UFI4CUZ7","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2017 - Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evol.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:24:41Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:24:44Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2584,"key":"UFI4CUZ7"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596018,"version":0},"$loki":271},{"itemID":2583,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":243,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wang et al. - 2017 - Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evol.pdf","parentItem":"UFI4CUZ7","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - 2017 - Detecting Influential Nodes Incrementally and Evol.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-06-14T10:24:41Z","dateModified":"2018-06-14T10:24:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/958DZM8F","itemID":2583,"key":"958DZM8F"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596018,"version":0},"$loki":272},{"itemID":2613,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":10,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://eudl.eu/doi/10.4108/eai.15-12-2016.2267791","publisher":"EAI","ISBN":"978-1-63190-132-4","date":"2017","extra":"00002","DOI":"10.4108/eai.15-12-2016.2267791","accessDate":"2018-06-15T23:55:54Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Wearable and personal devices are becoming more and more part of people’s everyday lives.

The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process ‘driven by the actors’, i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes (‘actor covariates’) and of characteristics of pairs of nodes (‘dyadic covariates’). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for model selection.","title":"Introduction to stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics","creators":[{"firstName":"Tom A.

However, eﬀective personalization hinges on collecting large amounts of personal data about users. With the exponential growth of activities in social networking websites, they have become a prominent platform to gather and analyze such information. Even though there exist a considerable number of social media users with publicly available data, previous studies have revealed a dichotomy between privacy-related intentions and behaviours. Users often face diﬃculties specifying privacy policies that are consistent with their actual privacy concerns and attitudes, and simply follow the default permissive privacy setting. Therefore, despite the availability of data, it is imperative to develop and employ algorithms to automatically predict users’ privacy preferences for personalization purposes. In this document, we review prior studies that tackle this challenging task and make use of users’ online social footprints to discover their desired privacy settings.","title":"Detecting Privacy Preferences from Online Social Footprints: A Literature Review","shortTitle":"Detecting Privacy Preferences from Online Social Footprints","creators":[{"firstName":"Taraneh","lastName":"Khazaei","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-10T14:32:09Z","dateModified":"2018-07-10T14:32:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/TT989TXY","attachments":[{"key":"Q3NPSUZT","version":23,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/89298/Khazaei293.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","accessDate":"2018-07-10T14:32:07Z","title":"Khazaei - 2016 - Detecting Privacy Preferences from Online Social F.pdf","parentItem":"TT989TXY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Khazaei - 2016 - Detecting Privacy Preferences from Online Social F.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-10T14:32:07Z","dateModified":"2018-07-10T14:32:09Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2803,"key":"TT989TXY"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596104,"version":0},"$loki":283},{"itemID":2802,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":23,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/89298/Khazaei293.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","accessDate":"2018-07-10T14:32:07Z","title":"Khazaei - 2016 - Detecting Privacy Preferences from Online Social F.pdf","parentItem":"TT989TXY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Khazaei - 2016 - Detecting Privacy Preferences from Online Social F.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-10T14:32:07Z","dateModified":"2018-07-10T14:32:09Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/Q3NPSUZT","itemID":2802,"key":"Q3NPSUZT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596104,"version":0},"$loki":284},{"itemID":2829,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1134271.1134282","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"74-81","ISBN":"978-1-59593-215-0","date":"2005","extra":"00257","DOI":"10.1145/1134271.1134282","accessDate":"2018-07-17T15:03:42Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"A major problem in social network analysis and link discovery is the discovery of hidden organizational structure and selection of interesting inﬂuential members based on low-level, incomplete and noisy evidence data.

Social inﬂuence is a major avenue for adopting online behaviors in general and privacy practices in particular. In this study, we examine how the source of inﬂuence affects the perceived behavioral intention to adopt privacy behavior. Our ﬁndings are based on a randomized experiment (167 U.S.based Amazon Mechanical Turk workers) using a custom Facebook application that collects feedback from participants regarding their intention to adopt privacy practices from different types of sources, including authoritative organizations and friends with varying tie strength correlative. Our results show that the source of social inﬂuence affects the susceptibility to adopt certain privacy behaviors and that there are different patterns of inﬂuence for security and privacy norms. More interestingly, susceptibility is modulated by the privacy perceptions of the user: users with high perceived behavioral control are more susceptible to peer inﬂuence. Additionally, we show that the intention to adopt privacy practices is correlated with the intention to further inﬂuence other people.","title":"Susceptibility to Social Influence of Privacy Behaviors: Peer versus Authoritative Sources","shortTitle":"Susceptibility to Social Influence of Privacy Behaviors","creators":[{"firstName":"Tamir","lastName":"Mendel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eran","lastName":"Toch","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T11:27:24Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T11:27:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/P75H7QLD","attachments":[{"key":"MNFAYQHW","version":23,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mendel and Toch - 2017 - Susceptibility to Social Influence of Privacy Beha.pdf","parentItem":"P75H7QLD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mendel and Toch - 2017 - Susceptibility to Social Influence of Privacy Beha.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T11:27:22Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T11:27:24Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2845,"key":"P75H7QLD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596128,"version":0},"$loki":287},{"itemID":2844,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":23,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mendel and Toch - 2017 - Susceptibility to Social Influence of Privacy Beha.pdf","parentItem":"P75H7QLD","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mendel and Toch - 2017 - Susceptibility to Social Influence of Privacy Beha.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-07-26T11:27:22Z","dateModified":"2018-07-26T11:27:24Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/MNFAYQHW","itemID":2844,"key":"MNFAYQHW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596128,"version":0},"$loki":288},{"itemID":2849,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":174,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"20","date":"2012","extra":"00019","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"This article aims to order and classify a wide number of metrics, proposed to characterize graphs, and the services using those graphs.

In this way, privacy metrics contribute to improving user privacy in the digital world. The diversity and complexity of privacy metrics in the literature makes an informed choice of metrics challenging. As a result, redundant new metrics are proposed frequently, and privacy studies are often incomparable. In this survey we alleviate these problems by structuring the landscape of privacy metrics. For this we explain and discuss a selection of over eighty privacy metrics and introduce a categorization based on the aspect of privacy they measure, their required inputs, and the type of data that needs protection. In addition, we present a method on how to choose privacy metrics based on eight questions that help identify the right privacy metrics for a given scenario, and highlight topics where additional work on privacy metrics is needed. Our survey spans multiple privacy domains and can be understood as a general framework for privacy measurement.","title":"Technical Privacy Metrics: a Systematic Survey","shortTitle":"Technical Privacy Metrics","creators":[{"firstName":"Isabel","lastName":"Wagner","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Eckhoff","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Information Theory","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Performance","type":1}],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-28T14:23:55Z","dateModified":"2018-08-28T14:23:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/YXF2A4PN","attachments":[{"key":"4VKQY9VN","version":210,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wagner and Eckhoff - 2018 - Technical Privacy Metrics a Systematic Survey.pdf","parentItem":"YXF2A4PN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wagner and Eckhoff - 2018 - Technical Privacy Metrics a Systematic Survey.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-28T14:23:38Z","dateModified":"2018-08-28T14:23:55Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2926,"key":"YXF2A4PN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596200,"version":0},"$loki":299},{"itemID":2910,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":210,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Wagner and Eckhoff - 2018 - Technical Privacy Metrics a Systematic Survey.pdf","parentItem":"YXF2A4PN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wagner and Eckhoff - 2018 - Technical Privacy Metrics a Systematic Survey.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-28T14:23:38Z","dateModified":"2018-08-28T14:23:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4VKQY9VN","itemID":2910,"key":"4VKQY9VN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596200,"version":0},"$loki":300},{"itemID":2928,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366414002308","volume":"52","pages":"47-59","publicationTitle":"Computer Communications","ISSN":"0140-3664","date":"October 1, 2014","extra":"00012","journalAbbreviation":"Computer Communications","DOI":"10.1016/j.comcom.2014.06.009","accessDate":"2018-09-04T08:55:12Z","libraryCatalog":"ScienceDirect","abstractNote":"In this paper, we propose a new approach for quantitative security analysis of computer systems. We intend to derive a metric of how much private information about a computer system can be disclosed to attackers. In fact, we want to introduce a methodology in order to be able to quantify our intuitive interpretation of how attackers act and how much they are predictable. This metric can be considered as an appropriate indicator for quantifying the security level of computer systems. We call the metric “Mean Privacy” and suggest a method for its quantification. It is quantified by using an information-theoretic model. For this purpose, we utilize a variant of attack tree that is able to systematically represent all feasible malicious attacks that are performed to violate the security of a system. The attack tree, as the underlying attack model, will be parameterized with some probability mass functions. The quantitative model will be used to express our intuition of the complexity of the attacks quantitatively. The usefulness of the proposed model lies in the context of security analysis. In fact, the analysis approach can be employed in some ways: Among several options for a system, we can indicate the most secure one using the metric as a comparative indicator. The security analysis of systems that operate under a variety of anticipated attack plans and different interaction environments can be carried out. Finally, new security policies, countermeasures and strategies can be applied to increase the security level of the systems.","title":"Mean privacy: A metric for security of computer systems","shortTitle":"Mean privacy","creators":[{"firstName":"Jaafar","lastName":"Almasizadeh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Abdollahi Azgomi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Privacy","type":1},{"tag":"Computer systems","type":1},{"tag":"Information theory","type":1},{"tag":"Quantification","type":1},{"tag":"Security","type":1}],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-04T08:55:12Z","dateModified":"2018-09-04T08:55:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/N6NVJGKT","attachments":[{"key":"QVAEV76T","version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0140366414002308/1-s2.0-S0140366414002308-main.pdf?_tid=255eba21-6c92-4daa-b289-8da03c8dc0bc&acdnat=1536051491_de6d7204f89f9ea343a88eeeca43b10d","accessDate":"2018-09-04T08:55:12Z","title":"Almasizadeh_Abdollahi Azgomi_2014_Mean privacy.pdf","parentItem":"N6NVJGKT","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Almasizadeh_Abdollahi Azgomi_2014_Mean privacy.pdf","note":"<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"title\"><strong>Contents</strong></p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" style=\"list-style-type: none;

Unconstrained by physical spaces, online social networks oﬀer to web users new interesting means to communicate, interact, and socialize. While these networks make frequent data sharing and inter-user communications instantly possible, privacy-related issues are their obvious much discussed immediate consequences. Although the notion of privacy may take diﬀerent forms, the ultimate challenge is how to prevent privacy invasion when much personal information is available. In this context, we address privacy-related issues by resorting to social network analysis and link mining techniques. We ﬁrst describe the fundamental of social networks, their common representations, and the main motivations associated with their use. Afterwards, we particularly show how privacy attacks can build on social network analysis and link mining techniques to reveal user-sensitive information. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some open challenges to address in future privacy-related works.","title":"Privacy in Online Social Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Elie","lastName":"Raad","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Chbeir","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["D2M4DBVZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-05T12:43:38Z","dateModified":"2018-09-05T12:45:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/SMMKFJSB","attachments":[{"key":"YAF6FVQ9","version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00975998/file/Privacy_in_Online_Social_Networks.pdf","accessDate":"2018-09-05T12:43:37Z","title":"Raad and Chbeir - Privacy in Online Social Networks.pdf","parentItem":"SMMKFJSB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Raad and Chbeir - Privacy in Online Social Networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-05T12:43:37Z","dateModified":"2018-09-05T12:43:39Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2932,"key":"SMMKFJSB"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596232,"version":0},"$loki":303},{"itemID":2931,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00975998/file/Privacy_in_Online_Social_Networks.pdf","accessDate":"2018-09-05T12:43:37Z","title":"Raad and Chbeir - Privacy in Online Social Networks.pdf","parentItem":"SMMKFJSB","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Raad and Chbeir - Privacy in Online Social Networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-05T12:43:37Z","dateModified":"2018-09-05T12:43:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/YAF6FVQ9","itemID":2931,"key":"YAF6FVQ9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596234,"version":0},"$loki":304},{"itemID":2934,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/926814/","volume":"vol.1","place":"Maui, HI, USA","publisher":"IEEE Comput.

Furthermore, we face information overload, increased uncertainty and risk taking as a prominent feature of modern living. As members of society, we cope with these complexities and uncertainties by relying trust, which is the basis of all social interactions. Although a small number of trust models have been proposed for the virtual medium, we find that they are largely impractical and artificial. In this paper we provide and discuss a trust model that is grounded in real-world social trust characteristics, and based on a reputation mechanism, or word-of-mouth. Our proposed model allows agents to decide which other agents’ opinions they trust more and allows agents to progressively tune their understanding of another agent’s subjective recommendations.","title":"Supporting trust in virtual communities","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","creators":[{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Abdul-Rahman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Hailes","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["728D65LR"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-05T13:20:15Z","dateModified":"2018-09-05T13:20:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/L2T78M6A","attachments":[{"key":"NQF8CNLT","version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6f12/7e35044fcef9d04d628a15a614d74d74cda3.pdf","accessDate":"2018-09-05T13:20:13Z","title":"Abdul-Rahman and Hailes - 2000 - Supporting trust in virtual communities.pdf","parentItem":"L2T78M6A","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Abdul-Rahman and Hailes - 2000 - Supporting trust in virtual communities.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-05T13:20:13Z","dateModified":"2018-09-05T13:20:15Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2934,"key":"L2T78M6A"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596244,"version":0},"$loki":305},{"itemID":2933,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6f12/7e35044fcef9d04d628a15a614d74d74cda3.pdf","accessDate":"2018-09-05T13:20:13Z","title":"Abdul-Rahman and Hailes - 2000 - Supporting trust in virtual communities.pdf","parentItem":"L2T78M6A","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Abdul-Rahman and Hailes - 2000 - Supporting trust in virtual communities.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-05T13:20:13Z","dateModified":"2018-09-05T13:20:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NQF8CNLT","itemID":2933,"key":"NQF8CNLT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596244,"version":0},"$loki":306},{"itemID":2948,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5283227/","place":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"26-33","ISBN":"978-1-4244-5334-4","date":"2009","extra":"00218","DOI":"10.1109/CSE.2009.387","accessDate":"2018-09-10T11:18:42Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","language":"en","abstractNote":"Social networking sites, such as MySpace, Facebook and Flickr, are gaining more and more popularity among Internet users. As users are enjoying this new style of networking, privacy concerns are also attracting increasing public attention due to reports about privacy breaches on social networking sites. We propose FaceCloak, an architecture that protects user privacy on a social networking site by shielding a user’s personal information from the site and from other users that were not explicitly authorized by the user. At the same time, FaceCloak seamlessly maintains usability of the site’s services. FaceCloak achieves these goals by providing fake information to the social networking site and by storing sensitive information in encrypted form on a separate server. We implemented our solution as a Firefox browser extension for the Facebook platform. Our experiments show that our solution successfully conceals a user’s personal information, while allowing the user and her friends to explore Facebook pages and services as usual.","title":"FaceCloak: An Architecture for User Privacy on Social Networking Sites","proceedingsTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering","shortTitle":"FaceCloak","creators":[{"firstName":"Wanying","lastName":"Luo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Xie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Urs","lastName":"Hengartner","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ED2DJ6VG"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-10T11:18:42Z","dateModified":"2018-09-10T11:18:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/9U8L88SW","attachments":[{"key":"ZVV3HLHV","version":183,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Luo et al. - 2009 - FaceCloak An Architecture for User Privacy on Soc.pdf","parentItem":"9U8L88SW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Luo et al. - 2009 - FaceCloak An Architecture for User Privacy on Soc.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-10T11:18:40Z","dateModified":"2018-09-10T11:18:42Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2948,"key":"9U8L88SW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596274,"version":0},"$loki":307},{"itemID":2947,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":183,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Luo et al. - 2009 - FaceCloak An Architecture for User Privacy on Soc.pdf","parentItem":"9U8L88SW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Luo et al. - 2009 - FaceCloak An Architecture for User Privacy on Soc.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-10T11:18:40Z","dateModified":"2018-09-10T11:18:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/ZVV3HLHV","itemID":2947,"key":"ZVV3HLHV"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596276,"version":0},"$loki":308},{"itemID":2949,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":216,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://fredstutzman.com/papers/CHI2010_Stutzman.pdf","accessDate":"2018-09-10T12:40:34Z","title":"Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield - 2010 - Friends only examining a privacy-enhancing behavi.pdf","parentItem":"THFX9UQG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield - 2010 - Friends only examining a privacy-enhancing behavi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-10T12:40:34Z","dateModified":"2018-09-10T12:40:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/5QPWN3FZ","itemID":2949,"key":"5QPWN3FZ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596292,"version":0},"$loki":310},{"itemID":2959,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":281,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/9739/5451756/08410404.pdf?tp=&arnumber=8410404&isnumber=5451756","accessDate":"2018-09-16T15:09:28Z","title":"Stellios et al_2018_A Survey of IoT-enabled Cyberattacks.pdf","parentItem":"4FIL58LV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Stellios et al_2018_A Survey of IoT-enabled Cyberattacks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-16T15:09:28Z","dateModified":"2018-09-16T15:09:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CJFU9GDS","itemID":2959,"key":"CJFU9GDS"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596308,"version":0},"$loki":312},{"itemID":2958,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"1-6","date":"May 2018","extra":"00002","DOI":"10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403755","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","conferenceName":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)","abstractNote":"Internet of Things (IoT) networks inter-connect billions of devices of diverse data types such as multimedia and sensor data.

This paper presents a novel algorithm which considers QoS, devices locations and service relevance metrics and creates more appropriate clusters for the networked IoT objects in order to improve IoT services quality. Objects are then attached to gateways or relay devices with better network quality, while the performance of poorly operating clusters is also improved.","title":"A Relay and Mobility Scheme for QoS Improvement in IoT Communications","proceedingsTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)","creators":[{"firstName":"A.

The word “edge” may carry different meanings. A common usage of the term refers to the edge network as opposed to the core network, with equipment such as edge routers, base stations, and home gateways. In that sense, there are several differences between fog and edge. First, fog is inclusive of cloud, core, metro, edge, clients, and things. The fog architecture will further enable pooling, orchestrating, managing, and securing the resources and functions distributed in the cloud, anywhere along the cloud-to-thing continuum, and on the things to support end-to-end services and applications. Second, fog seeks to realize a seamless continuum of computing services from the cloud to the things rather than treating the network edges as isolated computing platforms. Third, fog envisions a horizontal platform that will support the common fog computing functions for multiple industries and application domains, including but not limited to traditional telco services. Fourth, a dominant part of edge is mobile edge, whereas the fog computing architecture will be flexible enough to work over wireline as well as wireless networks.","title":"Clarifying Fog Computing

widespread adoption of Online Social Networks (OSNs) raises many questions on privacy and access control. Regardless of the particular centralized or de-centralized nature of the OSN, the achievable security and privacy degree strongly depends on the graph-theoretical properties of the social graph representing the real friendship relations between the users. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the social network graph topology and the achievable privacy.

That is quite different from other existing proposals, as it deals with real maps and actual streets, as well as several road trafﬁc distributions. We propose an evolutionary algorithm (later efﬁciently parallelized) to optimize our case studies which have been imported from OpenStreetMap into SUMO as they belong to a real city. We have also developed a Rerouting Algorithm which accesses the conﬁguration of the Red Swarm and communicates the route chosen to vehicles, using the spots (via WiFi link). Moreover, we have developed three competing algorithms in order to compare their results to those of Red Swarm and have observed that Red Swarm not only achieved the best results, but also outperformed the experts’ solutions in a total of 60 scenarios tested, with up to 19% shorter travel times.","title":"Red Swarm: Reducing travel times in smart cities by using bio-inspired algorithms","shortTitle":"Red Swarm","creators":[{"firstName":"Daniel H.","lastName":"Stolfi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Alba","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["MPA6STX6"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-26T07:02:14Z","dateModified":"2018-09-26T07:02:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/QK7YSMW9","attachments":[{"key":"U72VZ2XH","version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1568494614003457/1-s2.0-S1568494614003457-main.pdf?_tid=b2d5e4b7-fdc4-4a72-b6ab-0068a6761b48&acdnat=1537945463_3a2edaa50a267a2379c8a90cfed9028c","accessDate":"2018-09-26T07:02:12Z","title":"Stolfi and Alba - 2014 - Red Swarm Reducing travel times in smart cities b.pdf","parentItem":"QK7YSMW9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Stolfi and Alba - 2014 - Red Swarm Reducing travel times in smart cities b.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-26T07:02:12Z","dateModified":"2018-09-26T07:02:14Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3039,"key":"QK7YSMW9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596490,"version":0},"$loki":330},{"itemID":3038,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1568494614003457/1-s2.0-S1568494614003457-main.pdf?_tid=b2d5e4b7-fdc4-4a72-b6ab-0068a6761b48&acdnat=1537945463_3a2edaa50a267a2379c8a90cfed9028c","accessDate":"2018-09-26T07:02:12Z","title":"Stolfi and Alba - 2014 - Red Swarm Reducing travel times in smart cities b.pdf","parentItem":"QK7YSMW9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Stolfi and Alba - 2014 - Red Swarm Reducing travel times in smart cities b.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-26T07:02:12Z","dateModified":"2018-09-26T07:02:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/U72VZ2XH","itemID":3038,"key":"U72VZ2XH"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596492,"version":0},"$loki":331},{"itemID":3043,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"7","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"SUMO is an open source traffic simulation package including net import and demand modeling components.

This paper proposes a security risk estimation framework of social network privacy, aiming at quantifying privacy leakage probability when information is spread to the friends of target users’ friends. The privacy leakage probability in information spreading paths comprises Individual Privacy Leakage Probability (IPLP) and Relationship Privacy Leakage Probability (RPLP). IPLP is calculated based on individuals’ privacy protection awareness and the trust of protecting others’ privacy, while RPLP is derived from relationship strength estimation. Experiments show that the security risk estimation framework can assist users to find vulnerable friends by calculating the average and the maximum privacy leakage probability in all information spreading paths of target user in social network. Besides, three unfriending strategies are applied to decrease risk of privacy leakage and unfriending the maximum degree friend is optimal.","title":"Security Risk Estimation of Social Network Privacy Issue","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 2017 the 7th International Conference on Communication and Network Security  - ICCNS 2017","creators":[{"firstName":"Xueqin","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Gu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-07T19:25:20Z","dateModified":"2018-10-07T19:25:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/H5W3MLGW","attachments":[{"key":"XBNYL4HB","version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://delivery.acm.org.accesdistant.sorbonne-universite.fr/10.1145/3170000/3163073/p81-Zhang.pdf?ip=134.157.146.115&id=3163073&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=7EBF6E77E86B478F%2EA72B4D473219EA0C%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1538940548_d1730f1d0f25c79fdd031fcf9e8c0168","accessDate":"2018-10-07T19:25:17Z","title":"Zhang et al. - 2017 - Security Risk Estimation of Social Network Privacy.pdf","parentItem":"H5W3MLGW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang et al. - 2017 - Security Risk Estimation of Social Network Privacy.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-07T19:25:17Z","dateModified":"2018-10-07T19:25:20Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3053,"key":"H5W3MLGW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596580,"version":0},"$loki":338},{"itemID":3052,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://delivery.acm.org.accesdistant.sorbonne-universite.fr/10.1145/3170000/3163073/p81-Zhang.pdf?ip=134.157.146.115&id=3163073&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=7EBF6E77E86B478F%2EA72B4D473219EA0C%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1538940548_d1730f1d0f25c79fdd031fcf9e8c0168","accessDate":"2018-10-07T19:25:17Z","title":"Zhang et al. - 2017 - Security Risk Estimation of Social Network Privacy.pdf","parentItem":"H5W3MLGW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang et al. - 2017 - Security Risk Estimation of Social Network Privacy.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-07T19:25:17Z","dateModified":"2018-10-07T19:25:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/XBNYL4HB","itemID":3052,"key":"XBNYL4HB"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596582,"version":0},"$loki":339},{"itemID":3077,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04179","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1503.04179 [math]","date":"2015-03-13","extra":"00027 \narXiv: 1503.04179","accessDate":"2018-11-19T13:20:53Z","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","language":"en","abstractNote":"This paper studies the opinion dynamics that result when individuals consecutively discuss a sequence of issues. Specifically, we study how individuals' self-confidence levels evolve via a reflected appraisal mechanism. Motivated by the DeGroot-Friedkin model, we propose a Modified DeGroot-Friedkin model which allows individuals to update their self-confidence levels by only interacting with their neighbors and in particular, the modified model allows the update of self-confidence levels to take place in finite time without waiting for the opinion process to reach a consensus on any particular issue. We study properties of this Modified DeGroot-Friedkin model and compare the associated equilibria and stability with those of the original DeGroot-Friedkin model. Specifically, for the case when the interaction matrix is doubly stochastic, we show that for the modified model, the vector of individuals' self-confidence levels asymptotically converges to a unique nontrivial equilibrium which for each individual is equal to 1/n, where n is the number of individuals. This implies that eventually, individuals reach a democratic state.","title":"On a Modified DeGroot-Friedkin Model of Opinion Dynamics","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Basar","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Mathematics - Optimization and Control","type":1}],"collections":["THXI4EZV"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-19T13:20:53Z","dateModified":"2018-11-19T13:20:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JE99GUZR","attachments":[{"key":"WIJLSBWS","version":184,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04179.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-19T13:20:50Z","title":"Xu et al. - 2015 - On a Modified DeGroot-Friedkin Model of Opinion Dy.pdf","parentItem":"JE99GUZR","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Xu et al. - 2015 - On a Modified DeGroot-Friedkin Model of Opinion Dy.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-19T13:20:50Z","dateModified":"2018-11-19T13:20:54Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3077,"key":"JE99GUZR"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596604,"version":0},"$loki":340},{"itemID":3076,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":184,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04179.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-19T13:20:50Z","title":"Xu et al. - 2015 - On a Modified DeGroot-Friedkin Model of Opinion Dy.pdf","parentItem":"JE99GUZR","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Xu et al. - 2015 - On a Modified DeGroot-Friedkin Model of Opinion Dy.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-19T13:20:50Z","dateModified":"2018-11-19T13:20:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WIJLSBWS","itemID":3076,"key":"WIJLSBWS"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596606,"version":0},"$loki":341},{"itemID":3081,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"200","extra":"00012","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","title":"Centrality Measures on Big Graphs: Exact, Approximated, and Distributed Algorithms","creators":[{"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Bonchi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gianmarco De Francisci","lastName":"Morales","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Riondato","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RU8RKIZJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-19T13:57:11Z","dateModified":"2018-11-19T13:57:11Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/R8TL5T7V","attachments":[{"key":"BR649M39","version":272,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://matteo.rionda.to/centrtutorial/BonchiDeFrancisciMoralesRiondato-CentralityBigGraphsTutorial-Slides.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-19T13:57:10Z","title":"Bonchi et al. - Centrality Measures on Big Graphs Exact, Approxim.pdf","parentItem":"R8TL5T7V","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bonchi et al. - Centrality Measures on Big Graphs Exact, Approxim.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-19T13:57:10Z","dateModified":"2018-11-19T13:57:12Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3081,"key":"R8TL5T7V"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596624,"version":0},"$loki":342},{"itemID":3080,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":272,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://matteo.rionda.to/centrtutorial/BonchiDeFrancisciMoralesRiondato-CentralityBigGraphsTutorial-Slides.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-19T13:57:10Z","title":"Bonchi et al. - Centrality Measures on Big Graphs Exact, Approxim.pdf","parentItem":"R8TL5T7V","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bonchi et al. - Centrality Measures on Big Graphs Exact, Approxim.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-19T13:57:10Z","dateModified":"2018-11-19T13:57:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BR649M39","itemID":3080,"key":"BR649M39"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596624,"version":0},"$loki":343},{"itemID":3083,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1344743/","place":"Fredericton, NB, Canada","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"305-314","ISBN":"978-0-7695-2096-4","date":"2004","extra":"00531","DOI":"10.1109/DNSR.2004.1344743","accessDate":"2018-11-19T13:57:46Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"Proceedings.

Providing relevant information to the users to cater to their needs is the primary goal of website owners. Therefore, ﬁnding the content of the Web and retrieving the users’ interests and needs from their behavior have become increasingly important. Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing the users’ behavior, the content of the pages, and the order of the URLs that tend to be accessed in order. Web structure mining plays an important role in this approach. Two page ranking algorithms, HITS and PageRank, are commonly used in web structure mining. Both algorithms treat all links equally when distributing rank scores. Several algorithms have been developed to improve the performance of these methods. The Weighted PageRank algorithm (WPR), an extension to the standard PageRank algorithm, is introduced in this paper. WPR takes into account the importance of both the inlinks and the outlinks of the pages and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the pages. The results of our simulation studies show that WPR performs better than the conventional PageRank algorithm in terms of returning larger number of relevant pages to a given query.","title":"Weighted PageRank algorithm","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings.

And group emotions have a great impact on group behaviors and group outcomes. Based on the researches of group emotions described by Hatifield, we propose a quantitative method to building the group emotion model which is focus on a group or a crowd, not on an individual. Our aim is to reflect more believable emotion experiences of individuals in social situation; the individuals’ emotion is coming not only from the external stimulus, but from others group members through the conscious and unconscious induction of emotion states as well. For the emotional contagion plays a significant role in the development of group emotion, we select personality, emotional expressivity and susceptibility as mainly factors which influence the intensity of group emotions. Simulation is done by using Netlogo software, and the results show that the model is available and embody the fundamental characteristics of group emotion, and virtual individuals in crowd can generate credible emotional experience and response.","title":"Modeling Group Emotion Based on Emotional Contagion","bookTitle":"Intelligent Information Processing VI","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhongzhi","lastName":"Shi","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Leake","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Sunil","lastName":"Vadera","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"Yanjun","lastName":"Yin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Weiqing","lastName":"Tang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Weiqing","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["THXI4EZV"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-28T11:52:10Z","dateModified":"2018-11-28T11:52:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/28UQU6ZW","attachments":[{"key":"TTIBW5GH","version":184,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01524941/file/978-3-642-32891-6_31_Chapter.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-28T11:52:08Z","title":"Yin et al. - 2012 - Modeling Group Emotion Based on Emotional Contagio.pdf","parentItem":"28UQU6ZW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yin et al. - 2012 - Modeling Group Emotion Based on Emotional Contagio.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-28T11:52:08Z","dateModified":"2018-11-28T11:52:10Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3099,"key":"28UQU6ZW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596718,"version":0},"$loki":350},{"itemID":3098,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":184,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01524941/file/978-3-642-32891-6_31_Chapter.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-28T11:52:08Z","title":"Yin et al. - 2012 - Modeling Group Emotion Based on Emotional Contagio.pdf","parentItem":"28UQU6ZW","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yin et al. - 2012 - Modeling Group Emotion Based on Emotional Contagio.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-28T11:52:08Z","dateModified":"2018-11-28T11:52:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/TTIBW5GH","itemID":3098,"key":"TTIBW5GH"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596718,"version":0},"$loki":351},{"itemID":3102,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6288469/","place":"Kyoto, Japan","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"2681-2684","ISBN":"978-1-4673-0046-9 978-1-4673-0045-2 978-1-4673-0044-5","date":"03/2012","extra":"00006","DOI":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288469","accessDate":"2018-11-29T11:09:22Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"ICASSP 2012 - 2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing","language":"en","abstractNote":"We are interested in investigating the spread of contagion in a network, G, which describes the interactions between the agents in the system. The topology of this network is often neglected due to the assumption that each agent is connected with every other agents; this means that the network topology is a complete graph. While this allows for certain simpliﬁcations in the analysis, we fail to gain insight on the diffusion process for non-complete network topology. In this paper, we offer a continuous-time Markov chain infection model that explicitly accounts for the network topology, be it complete or noncomplete. Although we characterize our process using parameters from epidemiology, our approach can be applied to many application domains. We will show how to generate the inﬁnitesimal matrix that describes the evolution of this process for any topology. We also develop a general methodology to solve for the equilibrium distribution by considering symmetries in G. Our results show that network topologies have dramatic effect on the spread of infections.","title":"Accounting for topology in spreading contagion in non-complete networks","proceedingsTitle":"2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","creators":[{"firstName":"June","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jose M.F.","lastName":"Moura","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["28M75EK7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T11:09:22Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T15:21:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/MU68MWRY","attachments":[{"key":"R9X8293D","version":184,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~junez/PhD_Research_files/Writeup.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-29T11:09:20Z","title":"Zhang and Moura - 2012 - Accounting for topology in spreading contagion in .pdf","parentItem":"MU68MWRY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang and Moura - 2012 - Accounting for topology in spreading contagion in .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T11:09:20Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T11:09:23Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3102,"key":"MU68MWRY"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596744,"version":0},"$loki":352},{"itemID":3101,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":184,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~junez/PhD_Research_files/Writeup.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-29T11:09:20Z","title":"Zhang and Moura - 2012 - Accounting for topology in spreading contagion in .pdf","parentItem":"MU68MWRY","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zhang and Moura - 2012 - Accounting for topology in spreading contagion in .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T11:09:20Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T11:09:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/R9X8293D","itemID":3101,"key":"R9X8293D"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596744,"version":0},"$loki":353},{"itemID":3103,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"1125-1129","date":"May 2014","extra":"00002","DOI":"10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853772","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","conferenceName":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","abstractNote":"We model a SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemics over a static, finite-sized network as a continuous-time Markov process using the scaled SIS epidemics model.

This article is concerned with studying the time-asymptotic behaviour of the extended contact processes on static, undirected, ﬁnite-size networks. This is a contact process with nonzero exogenous infection rate (also known as the -susceptible-infectedsusceptible model). The only known analytical characterization of the equilibrium distribution of this process is for complete networks. For large networks with arbitrary topology, it is infeasible to numerically solve for the equilibrium distribution since it requires solving the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of a matrix that is exponential in N, the size of the network. We derive a condition on the infection rates under which, depending on the degree distribution of the network, the equilibrium distribution of extended contact processes on arbitrary, ﬁnite-size networks is well approximated by a closed-form formulation. We conﬁrm the goodness of the approximation with small networks answering inference questions like the distribution of the percentage of infected individuals and the most-probable equilibrium conﬁguration. We then use the approximation to analyse the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process on the 4941-node US Western power grid.","title":"Contact process with exogenous infection and the scaled SIS process","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["THXI4EZV"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T11:09:44Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T15:31:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7RQYSN68","attachments":[{"key":"L8DGFS4R","version":373,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://watermark.silverchair.com/cnx003.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAk8wggJLBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggI8MIICOAIBADCCAjEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMQ4q1aSX4QHx0MQBnAgEQgIICAgDJbI_tXx-7mjcYkZv9kJCJAndhONjGsv6-S8p6OPaqMHydnqqi_UB9dHwvkPGJGpvoqYcJbMa2soNxDmlTUynE9KtLtPfsvfNW5n5e0v3_NywgfV3pwEApECPnXfdNHkJh6jVPmq2I0v4u_Hfg80He8jwrCzttubF88G9SS8PspCkPIBbhulkMcSumxJrXO00Ryj_ybSO1cHZlVx6R3NZmCvfZcI3oXHSeozSr1BCtSDoSMRMNIKCSdYoEQOMoadNq5IuYvNHvhsGe77tmFLHsYS9bCiUJRlgvsHKoU31Fm3_0O3E38Zp97wTM4Sx9ypZBQmqVwL6lEw-ZGEDNhKb32yN1TQCUAIL0FF9Gk7U6j1JgjWjYFf90w9DL2O1X5QcB3uYUCvpjUk9ydJ20xroTyt3gauUYLQmZZ4jH6UMd_TBc5A87qvMsvxJjBORu4P64Wm6EkKsGo4ibxedO2MV_7J3Gf0FP_cioZ6TNxVRl6QlE--sV-fzb2mEzinGd3f1nuBe01SqSZwaM9vdlqhz8dsqlXlvYiJqTv_GpsFE4QE-prtIbrkLh1XA9faZHpwGfJsEf4dCEhtK571d_SOkucqREPmRBe4mbsP5g0OX-zyysENsCvfZ8jZAwkEC7VwWQThx78xYyfpkWJXgOg5NqN4f3CCZCcbe5INXB_OBSnNs","accessDate":"2018-11-29T11:09:42Z","title":"2017 - OUP accepted manuscript.pdf","parentItem":"7RQYSN68","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017 - OUP accepted manuscript.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T11:09:42Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T11:09:45Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3107,"key":"7RQYSN68"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596782,"version":0},"$loki":357},{"itemID":3106,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":373,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://watermark.silverchair.com/cnx003.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAk8wggJLBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggI8MIICOAIBADCCAjEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMQ4q1aSX4QHx0MQBnAgEQgIICAgDJbI_tXx-7mjcYkZv9kJCJAndhONjGsv6-S8p6OPaqMHydnqqi_UB9dHwvkPGJGpvoqYcJbMa2soNxDmlTUynE9KtLtPfsvfNW5n5e0v3_NywgfV3pwEApECPnXfdNHkJh6jVPmq2I0v4u_Hfg80He8jwrCzttubF88G9SS8PspCkPIBbhulkMcSumxJrXO00Ryj_ybSO1cHZlVx6R3NZmCvfZcI3oXHSeozSr1BCtSDoSMRMNIKCSdYoEQOMoadNq5IuYvNHvhsGe77tmFLHsYS9bCiUJRlgvsHKoU31Fm3_0O3E38Zp97wTM4Sx9ypZBQmqVwL6lEw-ZGEDNhKb32yN1TQCUAIL0FF9Gk7U6j1JgjWjYFf90w9DL2O1X5QcB3uYUCvpjUk9ydJ20xroTyt3gauUYLQmZZ4jH6UMd_TBc5A87qvMsvxJjBORu4P64Wm6EkKsGo4ibxedO2MV_7J3Gf0FP_cioZ6TNxVRl6QlE--sV-fzb2mEzinGd3f1nuBe01SqSZwaM9vdlqhz8dsqlXlvYiJqTv_GpsFE4QE-prtIbrkLh1XA9faZHpwGfJsEf4dCEhtK571d_SOkucqREPmRBe4mbsP5g0OX-zyysENsCvfZ8jZAwkEC7VwWQThx78xYyfpkWJXgOg5NqN4f3CCZCcbe5INXB_OBSnNs","accessDate":"2018-11-29T11:09:42Z","title":"2017 - OUP accepted manuscript.pdf","parentItem":"7RQYSN68","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"2017 - OUP accepted manuscript.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-29T11:09:42Z","dateModified":"2018-11-29T11:09:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/L8DGFS4R","itemID":3106,"key":"L8DGFS4R"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596782,"version":0},"$loki":358},{"itemID":3111,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"1535-1538","date":"November 2015","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/ACSSC.2015.7421402","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","conferenceName":"2015 49th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers","abstractNote":"To study signals on networks, to detect epidemics, or to predict blackouts, we need to understand network topology and its impact on the behavior of network processes.

There are two limiting cases widely analyzed in the physics literature, the so-called contact process (CP) where the contagion is expanded at a certain rate from an infected vertex to one neighbor at a time, and the reactive process (RP) in which an infected individual eﬀectively contacts all its neighbors to expand the epidemics. However, a more realistic scenario is obtained from the interpolation between these two cases, considering a certain number of stochastic contacts per unit time. Here we propose a discrete-time formulation of the problem of contact-based epidemic spreading. We resolve a family of models, parameterized by the number of stochastic contact trials per unit time, that range from the CP to the RP. In contrast to the common heterogeneous mean-ﬁeld approach, we focus on the probability of infection of individual nodes. Using this formulation, we can construct the whole phase diagram of the diﬀerent infection models and determine their critical properties.","title":"Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-based disease spreading in complex networks","creators":[{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Gomez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Arenas","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Borge-Holthoefer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S.","lastName":"Meloni","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Y.","lastName":"Moreno","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Physics - Computational Physics","type":1},{"tag":"Physics - Physics and Society","type":1}],"collections":["28M75EK7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-30T14:50:29Z","dateModified":"2018-11-30T14:50:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EHJYS7JH","attachments":[{"key":"IZSZCTG5","version":348,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.1313v2.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-30T14:49:15Z","title":"Gomez et al. - 2010 - Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-bas.pdf","parentItem":"EHJYS7JH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gomez et al. - 2010 - Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-bas.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-30T14:49:15Z","dateModified":"2018-11-30T14:50:30Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3123,"key":"EHJYS7JH"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596854,"version":0},"$loki":367},{"itemID":3122,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":348,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.1313v2.pdf","accessDate":"2018-11-30T14:49:15Z","title":"Gomez et al. - 2010 - Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-bas.pdf","parentItem":"EHJYS7JH","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gomez et al. - 2010 - Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-bas.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-30T14:49:15Z","dateModified":"2018-11-30T14:50:30Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/IZSZCTG5","itemID":3122,"key":"IZSZCTG5"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596860,"version":0},"$loki":368},{"itemID":3128,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04553","volume":"21","issue":"S2","pages":"451-458","publicationTitle":"Complexity","ISSN":"10762787","date":"11/2016","extra":"00000 \narXiv: 1509.04553","DOI":"10.1002/cplx.21825","accessDate":"2018-11-30T16:38:07Z","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","language":"en","abstractNote":"Bus transportation is considered as one of the most convenient and cheapest modes of public transportation in Indian cities. Due to their cost-eﬀectiveness and wide reachability, they help a signiﬁcant portion of the human population in cities to reach their destinations every day. Although from a transportation point of view they have numerous advantages over other modes of public transportation, they also pose a serious threat of contagious diseases spreading throughout the city. The presence of numerous local spatial constraints makes the process and extent of epidemic spreading extremely diﬃcult to predict. Also, majority of the studies have focused on the contagion processes on scale-free network topologies whereas, spatially-constrained realworld networks such as bus networks exhibit a wide-spectrum of network topology. Therefore, we aim in this study to understand this complex dynamical process of epidemic outbreak and information diﬀusion on the bus networks for six diﬀerent Indian cities using SI and SIR models. We identify epidemic thresholds for these networks which help us in controlling outbreaks by developing node-based immunization techniques.","title":"Contagion processes on urban bus networks in Indian cities","creators":[{"firstName":"Atanu","lastName":"Chatterjee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gitakrishnan","lastName":"Ramadurai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Krishna","lastName":"Jagannathan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Physics - Physics and Society","type":1}],"collections":["28M75EK7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-30T16:38:07Z","dateModified":"2018-11-30T16:38:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/J3LUMLXB","attachments":[{"key":"NT6ITYA7","version":184,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Chatterjee et al. - 2016 - Contagion processes on urban bus networks in India.pdf","parentItem":"J3LUMLXB","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Chatterjee et al. - 2016 - Contagion processes on urban bus networks in India.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-30T16:38:04Z","dateModified":"2018-11-30T16:38:08Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3128,"key":"J3LUMLXB"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596884,"version":0},"$loki":369},{"itemID":3127,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":184,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Chatterjee et al. - 2016 - Contagion processes on urban bus networks in India.pdf","parentItem":"J3LUMLXB","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Chatterjee et al. - 2016 - Contagion processes on urban bus networks in India.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-30T16:38:04Z","dateModified":"2018-11-30T16:38:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NT6ITYA7","itemID":3127,"key":"NT6ITYA7"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088596886,"version":0},"$loki":370},{"itemID":3132,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":409,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7254107/","volume":"2","issue":"6","pages":"455-470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","ISSN":"2327-4662","date":"12/2015","extra":"00039","DOI":"10.1109/JIOT.2015.2476915","accessDate":"2018-12-14T14:42:02Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"This paper capitalizes on two emerging trends, i.e. the growing use of wireless at the edge of industrial control networks and the growing interest to integrate IP into said networks. This is facilitated by recent design contributions from the IEEE and the IETF, where the former developed a highly efﬁcient deterministic time-frequency scheduled medium access control protocol in form of IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH and the latter IPv6 networking paradigms in form of 6LoWPAN/ROLL, and scheduling approaches in form of 6TiSCH. The focus of the present work is on advancing the state of the art of deterministic 6TiSCH schedules towards more ﬂexible but equally reliable distributed approaches. In addition, this paper aims to introduce the ﬁrst implementation of 6TiSCH networks for factory automation environments: it outlines the challenges faced to overcome the scalability issues inherent to multi-hop dense low-power networks; the experimental results conﬁrm that the naturally unreliable radio medium can support time-critical and reliable applications. These developments pave the way for wireless industry-grade monitoring approaches.","title":"*Decentralized Traffic Aware Scheduling in 6TiSCH Networks: Design and Experimental Evaluation","shortTitle":"Decentralized Traffic Aware Scheduling in 6TiSCH Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Accettura","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Elvis","lastName":"Vogli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria Rita","lastName":"Palattella","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Luigi Alfredo","lastName":"Grieco","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gennaro","lastName":"Boggia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mischa","lastName":"Dohler","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["TFCFA8KG","ET67I444"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/83MYT73C","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/M4B3QTLE","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/PLVINTIR"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-14T14:42:02Z","dateModified":"2019-02-07T23:05:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/XH9LNRR6","attachments":[{"key":"74P8QFEX","version":227,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Accettura et al. -

This difﬁculty stems from the fact that packet scheduling decisions at each hop inﬂuences and are inﬂuenced by decisions on other hops and only a few provably efﬁcient online scheduling algorithms exist in the multihop setting. We consider a general multihop wired network topology in which packets with various deadlines and weights arrive at and are destined to different nodes through given routes. We study the problem of joint admission control and packet scheduling in order to maximize the cumulative weights of the packets that reach their destinations within their deadlines. We ﬁrst focus on uplink transmissions in the tree topology and show that the well known earliest deadline ﬁrst algorithm achieves the same performance as the optimal off-line algorithm for any feasible arrival pattern. We then address the general topology with multiple source-destination pairs, develop a simple online algorithm and show that it is O(PM log PM )competitive where PM is the maximum route length among all packets. Our algorithm only requires information along the route of each packet and our result is valid for general arrival samples. Via numerical results, we show that our algorithm achieves performance that is comparable to the non-causal optimal offline algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst algorithm with a provable (based on a sample-path construction) competitive ratio, subject to hard deadline constraints for general network topologies.","title":"Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wired Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Zhoujia","lastName":"Mao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"C Emre","lastName":"Koksal","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ness B","lastName":"Shroff","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["8GE7IDJI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:25:58Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:25:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/2JB4LGK5","attachments":[{"key":"54CHPJVR","version":213,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf","parentItem":"2JB4LGK5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:25:51Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:25:58Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3167,"key":"2JB4LGK5"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597166,"version":0},"$loki":392},{"itemID":3158,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":213,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf","parentItem":"2JB4LGK5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:25:51Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:25:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/54CHPJVR","itemID":3158,"key":"54CHPJVR"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597166,"version":0},"$loki":393},{"itemID":3168,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":176,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/812444/","volume":"4","place":"Tokyo, Japan","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"441-446","ISBN":"978-0-7803-5731-0","date":"1999","extra":"00007","DOI":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812444","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:25:59Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","language":"en","abstractNote":"In this paper, Periodic Job-Shop-Scheduling Problem (PJSSP) extended from Job-Shop-Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is considered.

Asynchronous synthesis for net-modules of the jobs is suggested in this paper for optimal allocation of shared resources to different operations. To make sure the completion of all the jobs in a single iteration of a production cycle and the correct calculation of a makespan, the synchronization problem among jobs is tackled by introducing the special synchronizing transition in the model. A timed-place PN is adopted for the purpose of finding the feasible schedule in terms of the firing sequence of the transitions of the PN model by using the heuristic search method. Further, the characterization of the PN model is performed and it is shown that the PN model for a periodic job-shop scheduling problem is equivalent to a class of PN known as parallel process net with resources (PPNRs). The modeling approach is demonstrated with a practical example and a makespan is calculated for the example.","title":"Module-based architecture for a periodic job-shop scheduling problem","creators":[{"firstName":"Farooq","lastName":"Ahmad","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sher Afzal","lastName":"Khan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["8GE7IDJI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:26:01Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:26:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/SPA49AME","attachments":[{"key":"YNV7L35R","version":185,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ahmad and Khan - 2012 - Module-based architecture for a periodic job-shop .pdf","parentItem":"SPA49AME","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ahmad and Khan - 2012 - Module-based architecture for a periodic job-shop .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:25:52Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:26:01Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3169,"key":"SPA49AME"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597202,"version":0},"$loki":396},{"itemID":3160,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":185,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ahmad and Khan - 2012 - Module-based architecture for a periodic job-shop .pdf","parentItem":"SPA49AME","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ahmad and Khan - 2012 - Module-based architecture for a periodic job-shop .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:25:52Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:26:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/YNV7L35R","itemID":3160,"key":"YNV7L35R"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597204,"version":0},"$loki":397},{"itemID":3170,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.ijcte.org/show-29-645-1.html","pages":"250-257","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering","ISSN":"17938201","date":"2010","DOI":"10.7763/IJCTE.2010.V2.148","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:26:02Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Multiple resource sharing has a complex nature in parallel manufacturing processes due to the competition of different operations for scarce resources.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.","title":"Stochastic Petri nets: An elementary introduction","bookTitle":"Advances in Petri Nets 1989","shortTitle":"Stochastic Petri nets","creators":[{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Goos","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Hartmanis","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Barstow","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"W.","lastName":"Brauer","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Brinch Hansen","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Gries","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Luckham","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"C.","lastName":"Moler","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Pnueli","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Seegmüller","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Stoer","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"N.","lastName":"Wirth","creatorType":"seriesEditor"},{"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Rozenberg","creatorType":"editor"},{"firstName":"M.

Wireless communications have potential to support road safety by enabling road users to exchange information. In contrast to vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications for avoidance of inter-vehicle collisions, very limited efforts are made on communication mechanisms for pedestrian safety. This paper addresses the issue in a concrete way. We ﬁrst formulate the requirement of the minimum information exchange distance for providing road users to have the necessary amount of time to perceive the situation and react. We then report our ﬁeld tests and measurement based analysis to investigate if a Wi-Fi system can satisfy the application requirement. We also introduce a pedestrian protection application, V2ProVu, which provides the functionalities of the Wi-Fi communications, risk calculation, and hazard alarming. Our study discloses several useful insights including 1) information exchange for a velocity of 80 km/h has to be made before vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) distance is below 72 meters and 2) while this requirement is not too hard for radio communications technologies, the V2P communication range is greatly reduced if the signal is blocked by a human body.","title":"Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protection of vulnerable road users","proceedingsTitle":"2014 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium Proceedings","creators":[{"firstName":"Jose Javier","lastName":"Anaya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Merdrignac","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Oyunchimeg","lastName":"Shagdar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fawzi","lastName":"Nashashibi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jose E.","lastName":"Naranjo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/SEF7FJUN"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:37Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/5R3TNMEZ","attachments":[{"key":"NC5EHJSX","version":185,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Anaya et al. - 2014 - Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protectio.pdf","parentItem":"5R3TNMEZ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Anaya et al. - 2014 - Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protectio.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:33Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:27:38Z"},{"key":"JXIYEN7L","version":358,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Anaya et al. - 2014 - Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protectio.pdf","parentItem":"5R3TNMEZ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Anaya et al. - 2014 - Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protectio.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:50Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:36Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3182,"key":"5R3TNMEZ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597254,"version":0},"$loki":402},{"itemID":3172,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":185,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Anaya et al. - 2014 - Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protectio.pdf","parentItem":"5R3TNMEZ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Anaya et al. - 2014 - Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protectio.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:33Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:27:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NC5EHJSX","itemID":3172,"key":"NC5EHJSX"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597256,"version":0},"$loki":403},{"itemID":3330,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":358,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Anaya et al. - 2014 - Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protectio.pdf","parentItem":"5R3TNMEZ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Anaya et al. - 2014 - Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protectio.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:50Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JXIYEN7L","itemID":3330,"key":"JXIYEN7L"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597256,"version":0},"$loki":404},{"itemID":3183,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7297588/","place":"Vienna, Austria","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"450-456","ISBN":"978-1-4799-6729-2","date":"11/2014","DOI":"10.1109/ICCVE.2014.7297588","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:27:38Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2014 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","language":"en","abstractNote":"Road safety is one of the most important applications of vehicular networks. However, improving pedestrian safety via vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) wireless communication has not been extensively addressed. In this paper, our vision is to propose a method which enables development of V2P road safety applications via wireless communication and only utilizing the existing infrastructure and devices. As pedestrians’ smartphones do not support the IEEE 802.11p amendment which is customized for vehicular networking, we have initiated an approach that utilizes cellular technologies. Study shows potential of utilizing 3G and LTE for highly mobile entities of vehicular network applications. In addition, some vehicles are already equipped with cellular connectivity but otherwise the driver's smartphone is used as an alternative. However, smartphone limited battery life is a bottleneck in realization of such pedestrian safety system. To tackle the energy limitation in smartphones, we employ an adaptive multi-level approach which operates in an energy-saving mode in risk-free situations but switches to normal mode as it detects a risky situation. Based on our evaluation and analysis, this adaptive approach considerably saves electrical energy and thus makes the cellular-based road-safety system practical.","title":"Cellular-based vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) adaptive communication for collision avoidance","proceedingsTitle":"2014 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)","creators":[{"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Bagheri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Siekkinen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jukka K.","lastName":"Nurminen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/FSXVVKUT"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:38Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CB9GSBVX","attachments":[{"key":"NXFQYIBF","version":185,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bagheri et al. -

A pedestrian-to-vehicle communication system was developed by using a cellular phone and a car navigation system equipped with GPS and wireless communication function. We focused on intersections as a traffic scene to be covered by the system. After data was exchanged via FOMA in a wide area, information could be exchanged between a pedestrian and a vehicle via WLAN 20m, 100m away from an intersection to different directions in about 20ms.

In this paper a novel ADAS is presented, focused to avoid accidents that involve motorcyclist and cyclists using V2V communications, incorporating them to the vehicular networking taking into account the intrinsic features of each collective and adapting to increase their safety.","title":"Vulnerable Road Users Detection Using V2X Communications","proceedingsTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Jose J.","lastName":"Anaya","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Edgar","lastName":"Talavera","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gimenez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nuria","lastName":"Gomez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jimenez","lastName":"Felipe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jose Eugenio","lastName":"Naranjo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:48Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:27:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/6SEJISKV","attachments":[{"key":"8DEJ53LJ","version":236,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Anaya et al. - 2015 - Vulnerable Road Users Detection Using V2X Communic.pdf","parentItem":"6SEJISKV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Anaya et al. - 2015 - Vulnerable Road Users Detection Using V2X Communic.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:35Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:27:48Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3190,"key":"6SEJISKV"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597402,"version":0},"$loki":423},{"itemID":3180,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":236,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Anaya et al. - 2015 - Vulnerable Road Users Detection Using V2X Communic.pdf","parentItem":"6SEJISKV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Anaya et al. - 2015 - Vulnerable Road Users Detection Using V2X Communic.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:35Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:27:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/8DEJ53LJ","itemID":3180,"key":"8DEJ53LJ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597404,"version":0},"$loki":424},{"itemID":3191,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/8/18480","volume":"15","issue":"8","pages":"18480-18505","publicationTitle":"Sensors","ISSN":"1424-8220","date":"2015-07-29","extra":"00007","DOI":"10.3390/s150818480","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:27:49Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"V-Alert is a cooperative application to be deployed in the frame of Smart Cities with the aim of reducing the probability of accidents involving Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) and vehicles. The architecture of V-Alert combines short- and long-range communication technologies in order to provide more time to the drivers and VRU to take the appropriate maneuver and avoid a possible collision. The information generated by mobile sensors (vehicles and cyclists) is sent over this heterogeneous communication architecture and processed in a central server, the Drivers Cloud, which is in charge of generating the messages that are shown on the drivers’ and cyclists’ Human Machine Interface (HMI). First of all, V-Alert has been tested in a simulated scenario to check the communications architecture in a complex scenario and, once it was validated, all the elements of V-Alert have been moved to a real scenario to check the application reliability. All the results are shown along the length of this paper.","title":"V-Alert: Description and Validation of a Vulnerable Road User Alert System in the Framework of a Smart City","shortTitle":"V-Alert","creators":[{"firstName":"Unai","lastName":"Hernandez-Jayo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Idoia","lastName":"De-la-Iglesia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jagoba","lastName":"Perez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/M692ST9Q"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:49Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BGA8IHF2","attachments":[{"key":"HNEZ846S","version":332,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hernandez-Jayo et al. - 2015 - V-Alert Description and Validation of a Vulnerabl.pdf","parentItem":"BGA8IHF2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hernandez-Jayo et al. - 2015 - V-Alert Description and Validation of a Vulnerabl.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:36Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:27:50Z"},{"key":"V8RXAQJA","version":185,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hernandez-Jayo et al. - 2015 - V-Alert Description and Validation of a Vulnerabl.pdf","parentItem":"BGA8IHF2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hernandez-Jayo et al. - 2015 - V-Alert Description and Validation of a Vulnerabl.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:50Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:37Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3191,"key":"BGA8IHF2"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597422,"version":0},"$loki":425},{"itemID":3181,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":332,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hernandez-Jayo et al. - 2015 - V-Alert Description and Validation of a Vulnerabl.pdf","parentItem":"BGA8IHF2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hernandez-Jayo et al. - 2015 - V-Alert Description and Validation of a Vulnerabl.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:27:36Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:27:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/HNEZ846S","itemID":3181,"key":"HNEZ846S"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597424,"version":0},"$loki":426},{"itemID":3329,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":185,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hernandez-Jayo et al. - 2015 - V-Alert Description and Validation of a Vulnerabl.pdf","parentItem":"BGA8IHF2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hernandez-Jayo et al. - 2015 - V-Alert Description and Validation of a Vulnerabl.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:50Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/V8RXAQJA","itemID":3329,"key":"V8RXAQJA"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597424,"version":0},"$loki":427},{"itemID":3193,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1574119216300931","volume":"35","pages":"15-31","publicationTitle":"Pervasive and Mobile Computing","ISSN":"15741192","date":"02/2017","DOI":"10.1016/j.pmcj.2016.07.001","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:28:31Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"While Twitter and other Online Social Networks (OSNs) or microblogs are considered as a source of information for breaking news or uproarious and unexpected events, they could also be exploited as a dense worldwide sensors network for physical measurements. The corpus of geotagged posts from OSNs includes people’s feedbacks about a wide range of topics, with precise temporal and geographical metadata, that can be used as a support or an improvement to hardware sensors. For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area. Such a correlation can be exploited to integrate and extend existing air pollution monitoring networks. At the end of the manuscript we propose to further employ the time series of posts returned by the geosocial search to predict next pollution values.","title":"Using geosocial search for urban air pollution monitoring","creators":[{"firstName":"Matteo","lastName":"Sammarco","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Tse","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Pau","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Marfia","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BUQ52EQ6"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JCDG2AMF"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:28:31Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7TEEFV5R","attachments":[{"key":"IQPAFITD","version":345,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Sammarco et al. - 2017 - Using geosocial search for urban air pollution mon.pdf","parentItem":"7TEEFV5R","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sammarco et al. - 2017 - Using geosocial search for urban air pollution mon.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:28:29Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:28:31Z"},{"key":"7GTH2Z74","version":230,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Sammarco et al. - 2017 - Using geosocial search for urban air pollution mon.pdf","parentItem":"7TEEFV5R","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sammarco et al. - 2017 - Using geosocial search for urban air pollution mon.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:23Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:40Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3193,"key":"7TEEFV5R"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597438,"version":0},"$loki":428},{"itemID":3192,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":345,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Sammarco et al. - 2017 - Using geosocial search for urban air pollution mon.pdf","parentItem":"7TEEFV5R","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sammarco et al. - 2017 - Using geosocial search for urban air pollution mon.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:28:29Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:28:31Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/IQPAFITD","itemID":3192,"key":"IQPAFITD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597440,"version":0},"$loki":429},{"itemID":3266,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":230,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Sammarco et al. - 2017 - Using geosocial search for urban air pollution mon.pdf","parentItem":"7TEEFV5R","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sammarco et al. - 2017 - Using geosocial search for urban air pollution mon.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:23Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:40Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7GTH2Z74","itemID":3266,"key":"7GTH2Z74"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597440,"version":0},"$loki":430},{"itemID":3196,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":409,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/1/93","volume":"17","issue":"1","pages":"93","publicationTitle":"Sensors","ISSN":"1424-8220","date":"2017-01-05","extra":"00014","DOI":"10.3390/s17010093","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:28:47Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"The advance of technologies in several areas has allowed the development of smart city applications, which can improve the way of life in modern cities. When employing visual sensors in that scenario, still images and video streams may be retrieved from monitored areas, potentially providing valuable data for many applications. Actually, visual sensor networks may need to be highly dynamic, reﬂecting the changing of parameters in smart cities. In this context, characteristics of visual sensors and conditions of the monitored environment, as well as the status of other concurrent monitoring systems, may affect how visual sensors collect, encode and transmit information. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based approach to dynamically conﬁgure the way visual sensors will operate concerning sensing, coding and transmission patterns, exploiting different types of reference parameters. This innovative approach can be considered as the basis for multi-systems smart city applications based on visual monitoring, potentially bringing signiﬁcant results for this research ﬁeld.","title":"A Fuzzy-Based Approach for Sensing, Coding and Transmission Configuration of Visual Sensors in Smart City Applications","creators":[{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Costa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Collotta","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Pau","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Duran-Faundez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BUQ52EQ6","HZZE555E","ET67I444"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/6A9NJBYR","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/9JSCSJQF","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/TVUELUR3"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:28:47Z","dateModified":"2019-02-07T23:05:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EL66CM2J","attachments":[{"key":"M6G2UT5Q","version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Costa et al. - 2017 - A Fuzzy-Based Approach for Sensing, Coding and Tra.pdf","parentItem":"EL66CM2J","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Costa et al. - 2017 - A Fuzzy-Based Approach for Sensing, Coding and Tra.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:47Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:39Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3196,"key":"EL66CM2J"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597454,"version":0},"$loki":431},{"itemID":3323,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Costa et al. - 2017 - A Fuzzy-Based Approach for Sensing, Coding and Tra.pdf","parentItem":"EL66CM2J","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Costa et al. - 2017 - A Fuzzy-Based Approach for Sensing, Coding and Tra.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:47Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/M6G2UT5Q","itemID":3323,"key":"M6G2UT5Q"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597454,"version":0},"$loki":432},{"itemID":3197,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1247660.1247685","place":"San Juan, Puerto Rico","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"206","ISBN":"978-1-59593-614-1","date":"2007","extra":"00269","DOI":"10.1145/1247660.1247685","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:28:48Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"the 5th international conference","language":"en","abstractNote":"We consider the problem of providing vehicular Internet access using roadside 802.11 access points. We build on previous work in this area [18, 8, 5, 11] with an extensive experimental analysis of protocol operation at a level of detail not previously explored. We report on data gathered with four capture devices from nearly 50 experimental runs conducted with vehicles on a rural highway. Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25% of overall throughput, 15% of the time. (2) We quantify the eﬀects of ten problems caused by the mechanics of existing protocols that are responsible for this throughput loss; and (3) We recommend best practices for using vehicular opportunistic connections. Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be signiﬁcantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP. The central message in this paper is that wireless conditions in the vicinity of a roadside access point are predictable, and by exploiting this information, vehicular opportunistic access can be greatly improved.","title":"Vehicular opportunistic communication under the microscope","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Mobile systems, applications and services  - MobiSys '07","creators":[{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hadaller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Srinivasan","lastName":"Keshav","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Brecht","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shubham","lastName":"Agarwal","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BUQ52EQ6"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:28:48Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:28:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/TSZ72V6Y","attachments":[{"key":"WFJHZ6TI","version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hadaller et al. - 2007 - Vehicular opportunistic communication under the mi.pdf","parentItem":"TSZ72V6Y","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hadaller et al. - 2007 - Vehicular opportunistic communication under the mi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:28:45Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:28:49Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3197,"key":"TSZ72V6Y"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597468,"version":0},"$loki":433},{"itemID":3195,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hadaller et al. - 2007 - Vehicular opportunistic communication under the mi.pdf","parentItem":"TSZ72V6Y","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hadaller et al. - 2007 - Vehicular opportunistic communication under the mi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:28:45Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:28:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WFJHZ6TI","itemID":3195,"key":"WFJHZ6TI"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597468,"version":0},"$loki":434},{"itemID":3199,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":420,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214209614000412","volume":"1","issue":"4","pages":"181-196","publicationTitle":"Vehicular Communications","ISSN":"22142096","date":"10/2014","extra":"00013","DOI":"10.1016/j.vehcom.2014.08.002","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:29:27Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Over the last few years, academia, governmental agencies, automotive and electronic industries have increased their interest in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and services.

However, GPS errors sometimes impede map-matching algorithms in finding the correct segment, especially in dense and complicated parts of the network, such as near intersections with acute angles or on close parallel roads. In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is explored to improve the segment identification accuracy of map-matching algorithms. The proposed ANN is continuously trained by using the horizontal shift imposed on GPS points and once it is trained, it will be used to correct raw GPS points before inputting them into the map-matching algorithm. Integrating the proposed ANN enabled an existing map-matching algorithm to find the correct segments for some of the GPS points where the original map-matching algorithm had failed to do so.","title":"A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accuracy of GPS-Based Map-Matching Algorithms (Invited Paper)","proceedingsTitle":"2016 IEEE 17th International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI)","creators":[{"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Hashemi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hassan A.","lastName":"Karimi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["2QRYPJQZ","ET67I444"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JNPB3X76","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/QLRQWF9U","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/S5UWKSNJ","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/T7WX2PGA"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:30:02Z","dateModified":"2019-02-07T23:05:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WLTG495V","attachments":[{"key":"WYY3J3YI","version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","parentItem":"WLTG495V","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:29:59Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:02Z"},{"key":"4JDTEH9T","version":208,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","parentItem":"WLTG495V","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:33:10Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:39:42Z"},{"key":"AUG6X2BX","version":256,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","parentItem":"WLTG495V","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:26Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:38Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3205,"key":"WLTG495V"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597510,"version":0},"$loki":442},{"itemID":3201,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","parentItem":"WLTG495V","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:29:59Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WYY3J3YI","itemID":3201,"key":"WYY3J3YI"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597510,"version":0},"$loki":443},{"itemID":3222,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":208,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","parentItem":"WLTG495V","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:33:10Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:39:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4JDTEH9T","itemID":3222,"key":"4JDTEH9T"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597512,"version":0},"$loki":444},{"itemID":3274,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":256,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","parentItem":"WLTG495V","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hashemi and Karimi - 2016 - A Machine Learning Approach to Improve the Accurac.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:26Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/AUG6X2BX","itemID":3274,"key":"AUG6X2BX"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597512,"version":0},"$loki":445},{"itemID":3206,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8169804/","place":"St. Pierre","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"9-15","ISBN":"978-1-5090-4934-9","date":"10/2017","extra":"00002","DOI":"10.1109/GIIS.2017.8169804","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:30:04Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2017 Global Information Infrastructure and Networking Symposium (GIIS)","language":"en","abstractNote":"High volumes of pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users (VRUs) have much higher casualty rates per mile;

In order to alleviate the problem, we can use sensing capabilities of mobile smartphones to detect, warn and safeguard VRUs. In this research we have proposed an infrastructure-less fog-based architecture where fog nodes process delay sensitive data obtained from smartphones for alerting pedestrians and drivers before sending the data to the cloud for further analysis. Fog computing is used in order to develop the architecture since it is an emerging paradigm that has paramount of advantages for low-latency applications which demand mobility support, geodistribution and location awareness. We have also defined an algorithm for accident prediction and alerting involving vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture is able to render alerts in real time whichever wireless communication (Wi-Fi or LTE) is used to connect smartphones with fog nodes. Moreover, analytical and performance evaluations depict that the new architecture outperforms other related architectures in terms of reliability, scalability and latency.","title":"PV-Alert: A fog-based architecture for safeguarding vulnerable road users","proceedingsTitle":"2017 Global Information Infrastructure and Networking Symposium (GIIS)","shortTitle":"PV-Alert","creators":[{"firstName":"Esubalew","lastName":"Alemneh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sidi-Mohammed","lastName":"Senouci","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Brunet","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["2QRYPJQZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:30:04Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/AHI3K9JT","attachments":[{"key":"ZTR52NN7","version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alemneh et al. - 2017 - PV-Alert A fog-based architecture for safeguardin.pdf","parentItem":"AHI3K9JT","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alemneh et al. - 2017 - PV-Alert A fog-based architecture for safeguardin.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:29:59Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:04Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3206,"key":"AHI3K9JT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597534,"version":0},"$loki":446},{"itemID":3202,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alemneh et al. - 2017 - PV-Alert A fog-based architecture for safeguardin.pdf","parentItem":"AHI3K9JT","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alemneh et al. - 2017 - PV-Alert A fog-based architecture for safeguardin.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:29:59Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/ZTR52NN7","itemID":3202,"key":"ZTR52NN7"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597536,"version":0},"$loki":447},{"itemID":3207,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://jwcn-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13638-017-0814-6","volume":"2017","issue":"1","publicationTitle":"EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking","ISSN":"1687-1499","date":"12/2017","extra":"00005","DOI":"10.1186/s13638-017-0814-6","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:30:05Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Map-matching is the process of matching the GPS locus to the road network on the digital map. However, due to the most existing map-matching algorithms that are based on high sampling rate, when the sampling interval is increased, the correct rate of the algorithm will be greatly reduced. Based on this, this paper proposed a new algorithm of map-matching for low sampling rate GPS trajectories. The algorithm gave full consideration to the road network of the geometric structure and topological structure and the mutual influence between adjacent points (time, speed information) by calculating the probability of each trajectory point of candidate points to determine matching results. At the end of this paper, we use the data of Beijing UCAR Inc.’s car in a case study. This case demonstrates: For low sampling rate matching track points in the complex road, the algorithm has a good uptime, and an exact match was found.","title":"A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS trajectories on map-matching","creators":[{"firstName":"Yankai","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["2QRYPJQZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:30:05Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JVB2DZXW","attachments":[{"key":"IFHB6A8F","version":341,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Liu and Li - 2017 - A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS traject.pdf","parentItem":"JVB2DZXW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Liu and Li - 2017 - A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS traject.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:30:00Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:05Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3207,"key":"JVB2DZXW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597558,"version":0},"$loki":448},{"itemID":3203,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":341,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Liu and Li - 2017 - A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS traject.pdf","parentItem":"JVB2DZXW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Liu and Li - 2017 - A novel algorithm of low sampling rate GPS traject.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:30:00Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:30:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/IFHB6A8F","itemID":3203,"key":"IFHB6A8F"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597560,"version":0},"$loki":449},{"itemID":3212,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/218246/","volume":"2014","pages":"1-11","publicationTitle":"The Scientific World Journal","ISSN":"2356-6140, 1537-744X","date":"2014","extra":"00002","DOI":"10.1155/2014/218246","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for Pedestrian Protection Oriented Automotive Collision Avoidance System","creators":[{"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Lie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ren","lastName":"Zejian","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Pingshu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Jing","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NVN5CXR2","attachments":[{"key":"H32JVA38","version":327,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Lie et al. - 2014 - Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for P.pdf","parentItem":"NVN5CXR2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lie et al. - 2014 - Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for P.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:31:00Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3212,"key":"NVN5CXR2"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597572,"version":0},"$loki":450},{"itemID":3208,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":327,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Lie et al. - 2014 - Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for P.pdf","parentItem":"NVN5CXR2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lie et al. - 2014 - Advanced Emergency Braking Controller Design for P.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:31:00Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:31:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/H32JVA38","itemID":3208,"key":"H32JVA38"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597574,"version":0},"$loki":451},{"itemID":3213,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":177,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"11","extra":"00000","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"Current research in Intelligent Transport Systems is focussing on informing cars to make traffic more efficient and safer.

These collision prevention systems are mainly autonomous systems and are not cooperating with other detection systems. We propose to extend CALM, the communication standard for cooperative vehicular systems (16), with a local communication system for protection devices for vulnerable road users.

The efﬁciency of such a technique is largely affected by the sensor’s visibility condition. Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication can also contribute to the VRU safety by allowing vehicles and pedestrians to exchange information. This solution is, however, largely affected by the reliability of the exchanged information, which most generally is the GPS data. Since perception and communication have complementary features, we can expect that a combination of such approaches can be a solution to the VRU safety. This is the motivation of the current work. We develop theoretical models to present the characteristics of perception and communications systems. Experimental studies are conducted to compare the performances of these techniques in real-world environments. Our results show that the perception system reliably detects pedestrians and other objects within 50 m of range in the line-of-sight (LOS) condition. In contrast, the V2P communication coverage is approximately 340 and 200 meters in LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) conditions, respectively.

Although it is a common belief that this ﬁgure could shrink with the use of new sensor and communication technologies, unfortunately, none such systems have hit the road to date. Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we ﬁll this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system speciﬁcally devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios. Our experiments conﬁrm what has been observed before in theory and simulation, i.e., the use of such a system can reduce, by as much as 40%, the amount of vehicles involved in highway pileups.","title":"Safe Driving in LA: Report from the Greatest Intervehicular Accident Detection Test Ever","shortTitle":"Safe Driving in LA","creators":[{"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Marfia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Roccetti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Amoroso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Pau","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7MUKWGPA","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WES8CU4X"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:32:38Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/79A4S4N6","attachments":[{"key":"DUV6T8YZ","version":298,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","parentItem":"79A4S4N6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:32:35Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:32:38Z"},{"key":"NI6KA4JF","version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","parentItem":"79A4S4N6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:46Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:35Z"},{"key":"STIFQTZX","version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","parentItem":"79A4S4N6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:04Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:35Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3219,"key":"79A4S4N6"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597650,"version":0},"$loki":462},{"itemID":3217,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":298,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","parentItem":"79A4S4N6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:32:35Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:32:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/DUV6T8YZ","itemID":3217,"key":"DUV6T8YZ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597652,"version":0},"$loki":463},{"itemID":3321,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","parentItem":"79A4S4N6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:46Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NI6KA4JF","itemID":3321,"key":"NI6KA4JF"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597652,"version":0},"$loki":464},{"itemID":3384,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":186,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","parentItem":"79A4S4N6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Marfia et al. - 2013 - Safe Driving in LA Report from the Greatest Inter.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:04Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/STIFQTZX","itemID":3384,"key":"STIFQTZX"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597652,"version":0},"$loki":465},{"itemID":3226,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":178,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7574851/","place":"Chengdu, China","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"365-369","ISBN":"978-1-5090-2733-0","date":"6/2016","DOI":"10.1109/CYBER.2016.7574851","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:33:13Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER)","language":"en","abstractNote":"This paper proposes a position and attitude observer based on INS and GPS.

Traditional Kalman ﬁlter-based INS/GPS integration schemes have several inadequacies related to sensor error model and immunity to noise. Alternatively, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks with three layers have been implemented to improve the position accuracy of the integrated system. However, MLP neural networks show poor accuracy for low-cost INS because of the large inherent sensor errors. For the ﬁrst time the paper demonstrates the use of knowledge-based source difference artiﬁcial neural network (SDANN) to improve navigation performance of low-cost sensor, with or without external aiding sources. Unlike the conventional MLP or artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN), the structure of SDANN consists of two MLP neural networks called the coarse model and the difference model. The coarse model learns the input–output data relationship whereas the difference model adds knowledge to the system and ﬁne-tunes the coarse model output by learning the associated training or estimation error.

The proposed approach is to modify the velocity formula of the general PSO systems in order for improving the searching efﬁciency and actual execution time. Three PID control parameters, i.e., the proportional gain Kp, integral gain Ki and derivative gain Kd are required to form a parameter vector which is considered as a particle of PSO. To derive the optimal PID parameters for the Ar.Drone, the modiﬁed update method is employed to move the positions of all particles in the population. In the meanwhile, multi-objective functions deﬁned for PID controller optimization problems are minimized. The results verify that the proposed MOPSO is able to perform appropriately in Ar.Drone control system.","title":"AR.Drone UAV control parameters tuning based on particle swarm optimization algorithm","proceedingsTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Automation, Quality and Testing, Robotics (AQTR)","creators":[{"firstName":"Thi Thoa","lastName":"Mac","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Cosmin","lastName":"Copot","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Trung Tran","lastName":"Duc","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"De Keyser","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["8CGSITNW"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:36:26Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:36:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/STCVAALT","attachments":[{"key":"YGJ852A6","version":187,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mac et al. - 2016 - AR.Drone UAV control parameters tuning based on pa.pdf","parentItem":"STCVAALT","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mac et al. - 2016 - AR.Drone UAV control parameters tuning based on pa.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:36:23Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:36:27Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3256,"key":"STCVAALT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597814,"version":0},"$loki":497},{"itemID":3252,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":187,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Mac et al. - 2016 - AR.Drone UAV control parameters tuning based on pa.pdf","parentItem":"STCVAALT","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Mac et al. - 2016 - AR.Drone UAV control parameters tuning based on pa.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:36:23Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:36:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/YGJ852A6","itemID":3252,"key":"YGJ852A6"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597814,"version":0},"$loki":498},{"itemID":3258,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":178,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2505469.2505472","place":"Miami, Florida, USA","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"25","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2364-2","date":"2013","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1145/2505469.2505472","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:36:28Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"the 8th ACM international workshop","language":"en","abstractNote":"Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) employed in civil missions are receiving remarkable attention from both research and industry. UAVs embed more and more sensor technology, and their small mounted cameras allow for eﬃcient mapping of large areas in short time. Yet, civil missions such as rescue operations would need a timely delivery of high-resolution images, which calls for high-speed communication such as provided by WLAN IEEE 802.11n. Driven by extensive experiments, the key ﬁnding of this contribution is that 802.11n performs poorly in highly mobile and aerial scenarios, as the throughput between UAVs drops far below the theoretical maximum as soon as they become airborne. This is partially caused by the limitations of the embedded hardware, but also a result of the network dynamics of the aerial links. In order to dissect the origins of the low performance ﬁgures, we isolate the potential causes of degradation by analyzing our data of throughput, packet loss, aircraft and antenna orientation, and cruise speed. We discuss quantitatively how practical it is to deliver high-resolution images when being exposed to aerial throughput. We believe that it will be a long way until micro UAVs transferring large-size data become reality and argue for a new amendment of IEEE 802.11 addressing the communication among highly-mobile UAVs.","title":"From ground to aerial communication: dissecting WLAN 802.11n for the drones","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 8th ACM international workshop on Wireless network testbeds, experimental evaluation & characterization - WiNTECH '13","shortTitle":"From ground to aerial communication","creators":[{"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Asadpour","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Giustiniano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karin Anna","lastName":"Hummel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["8CGSITNW"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:36:28Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:36:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/DX96K8M8","attachments":[{"key":"XPSRA3NT","version":187,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Asadpour et al. - 2013 - From ground to aerial communication dissecting WL.pdf","parentItem":"DX96K8M8","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Asadpour et al. - 2013 - From ground to aerial communication dissecting WL.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:36:23Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:36:29Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3258,"key":"DX96K8M8"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597830,"version":0},"$loki":499},{"itemID":3254,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":187,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Asadpour et al. - 2013 - From ground to aerial communication dissecting WL.pdf","parentItem":"DX96K8M8","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Asadpour et al. - 2013 - From ground to aerial communication dissecting WL.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:36:23Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:36:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/XPSRA3NT","itemID":3254,"key":"XPSRA3NT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597830,"version":0},"$loki":500},{"itemID":3260,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":178,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5715879/","volume":"12","issue":"2","pages":"390-401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","ISSN":"1524-9050, 1558-0016","date":"06/2011","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/TITS.2010.2091272","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:38:13Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Collision avoidance is one of the most difﬁcult and challenging automatic driving operations in the domain of intelligent vehicles. In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers’ behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to deﬁne the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed ﬁeld tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.","title":"Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a Fuzzy Steering Controller","creators":[{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Fernandez Llorca","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vicente","lastName":"Milanes","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Parra Alonso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Gavilan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Iván","lastName":"Garcia Daza","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joshué","lastName":"Perez","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Miguel Ángel","lastName":"Sotelo","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:38:13Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:38:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/V5UW8H9X","attachments":[{"key":"L74LE6CY","version":372,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Fernandez Llorca et al. - 2011 - Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a .pdf","parentItem":"V5UW8H9X","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Fernandez Llorca et al. - 2011 - Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:38:12Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:38:14Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3260,"key":"V5UW8H9X"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597846,"version":0},"$loki":501},{"itemID":3259,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":372,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Fernandez Llorca et al. - 2011 - Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a .pdf","parentItem":"V5UW8H9X","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Fernandez Llorca et al. - 2011 - Autonomous Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using a .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:38:12Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:38:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/L74LE6CY","itemID":3259,"key":"L74LE6CY"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597848,"version":0},"$loki":502},{"itemID":3262,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":409,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1467-9671.2009.01147.x","volume":"13","issue":"2","pages":"197-214","publicationTitle":"Transactions in GIS","ISSN":"13611682, 14679671","date":"04/2009","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9671.2009.01147.x","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:40:04Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Accurate vehicle tracking is essential for navigation systems to function correctly. Unfortunately, GPS data is still plagued with errors that frequently produce inaccurate trajectories. Research in map matching algorithms focuses on how to efficiently match GPS tracking data to the underlying road network. This article presents an innovative map matching algorithm that considers the trajectory of the data rather than merely the current position as in the typical map matching case. Instead of computing the precise angle which is traditionally used, a discrete eightdirection chain code, to represent a trend of movement, is used. Coupled with distance information, map matching decisions are made by comparing the differences between trajectories representing the road segments and GPS tracking data chain-codes. Moreover, to contrast the performance of the chain-code algorithm, two evaluation strategies, linear and non-linear, are analyzed. The presented chain-code map matching algorithm was evaluated for wheelchair navigation using university campus sidewalk data. The evaluation results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in terms of accuracy and computational time.","title":"A Chain-Code-Based Map Matching Algorithm for Wheelchair Navigation","creators":[{"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Ren","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hassan A","lastName":"Karimi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["2QRYPJQZ","ET67I444"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/7CDHDEXK","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/A5UGYQKA","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/GP77MCLB"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:40:04Z","dateModified":"2019-02-07T23:05:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/S7FVXSRN","attachments":[{"key":"VPZFQ3U9","version":187,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ren and Karimi - 2009 - A Chain-Code-Based Map Matching Algorithm for Whee.pdf","parentItem":"S7FVXSRN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ren and Karimi - 2009 - A Chain-Code-Based Map Matching Algorithm for Whee.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:40:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:40:05Z"},{"key":"ZG49KU2U","version":187,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ren and Karimi - 2009 - A Chain-Code-Based Map Matching Algorithm for Whee.pdf","parentItem":"S7FVXSRN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ren and Karimi - 2009 - A Chain-Code-Based Map Matching Algorithm for Whee.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:46Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:33Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3262,"key":"S7FVXSRN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597864,"version":0},"$loki":503},{"itemID":3261,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":187,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ren and Karimi - 2009 - A Chain-Code-Based Map Matching Algorithm for Whee.pdf","parentItem":"S7FVXSRN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ren and Karimi - 2009 - A Chain-Code-Based Map Matching Algorithm for Whee.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:40:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:40:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/VPZFQ3U9","itemID":3261,"key":"VPZFQ3U9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597864,"version":0},"$loki":504},{"itemID":3320,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":187,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ren and Karimi - 2009 - A Chain-Code-Based Map Matching Algorithm for Whee.pdf","parentItem":"S7FVXSRN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ren and Karimi - 2009 - A Chain-Code-Based Map Matching Algorithm for Whee.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:46Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/ZG49KU2U","itemID":3320,"key":"ZG49KU2U"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597866,"version":0},"$loki":505},{"itemID":3271,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":420,"itemType":"attachment","title":"1502.00164v1.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"1502.00164v1.pdf","tags":[],"collections":["ET67I444"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:25Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:42:25Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/FUC8LNUM","itemID":3271,"key":"FUC8LNUM"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088597878,"version":0},"$loki":506},{"itemID":3279,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":420,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140366414003168","volume":"54","pages":"1-31","publicationTitle":"Computer Communications","ISSN":"01403664","date":"12/2014","DOI":"10.1016/j.comcom.2014.09.008","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:42:29Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines aspects and technologies coming from different approaches.

Market research has shown a signiﬁcant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a signiﬁcant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the ﬁeld of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT.

Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classiﬁcation for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.","title":"Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"Rens W.","lastName":"van der Heijden","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Dietzel","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Leinmüller","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Kargl","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","type":1}],"collections":["CXSBVN9S"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:56Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:42:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/757ZTYX5","attachments":[{"key":"W67H3GPW","version":187,"itemType":"attachment","title":"van der Heijden et al. - 2016 - Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Int.pdf","parentItem":"757ZTYX5","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"van der Heijden et al. - 2016 - Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Int.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:42:25Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:42:57Z"}],"notes":[{"key":"WMF6G9B6","version":187,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"757ZTYX5","note":"Comment: 33 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables.

Existing map-matching algorithms are compared and contrasted with respect to positioning sensors, map qualities, assumptions and accuracies. The results of these comparisons provide interesting insights into the workings of existing algorithms and the issues they must address for improving their performance. Example ﬁndings are: (a) not all map-matching algorithms pay sufﬁcient attention to topology of networks, directionality of roads or turn-restrictions; (b) most map-matching algorithms make an unbalanced trade-off between performance and accuracy; and (c) weight-based map-matching algorithms balance simplicity and accuracy and advanced map-matching algorithms provide high accuracy but with low performance.

One of the key issues enabling future solutions is achieving an effective integration between mobile apps and vehicles. Such integration can be efﬁciently achieved on all existing vehicles by relying on the On Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) interface. This allows obtaining critical information such as speed, fuel consumption, gas emissions and system failures. In this paper we propose a vehicle emulation platform, called VEWE, that allows developing and testing OBD-II aware applications. The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter. We compare our results with respect to those obtained in real vehicles, and demonstrate that our VEWE platform behaves similarly to realistic on board devices, thereby providing a complete and reliable platform for smartphone application development.","title":"Validation of a vehicle emulation platform supporting OBD-II communications","proceedingsTitle":"2015 12th Annual IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)","creators":[{"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Alvear","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carlos T.","lastName":"Calafate","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Juan-Carlos","lastName":"Cano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Manzoni","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:22Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/8N9RPZBN","attachments":[{"key":"3Y6VC32N","version":206,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Validation of a vehicle emulation platform support.pdf","parentItem":"8N9RPZBN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Validation of a vehicle emulation platform support.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:19Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:23Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3304,"key":"8N9RPZBN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598044,"version":0},"$loki":527},{"itemID":3299,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":206,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Validation of a vehicle emulation platform support.pdf","parentItem":"8N9RPZBN","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Validation of a vehicle emulation platform support.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:19Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:23Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/3Y6VC32N","itemID":3299,"key":"3Y6VC32N"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598044,"version":0},"$loki":528},{"itemID":3305,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":179,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2837126.2843842","place":"Brussels, Belgium","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"393-397","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3493-8","date":"2015","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1145/2837126.2843842","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:43:25Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"the 13th International Conference","language":"en","abstractNote":"Nowadays, the impact of global warming is causing societies to become more aware and responsive to environmental problems. As a result, pollution sensing is gaining more relevance. In order to have a strict control over air quality, the use of mobile sensors is becoming a promising alternative to traditional air quality stations. Mobile sensors allow to easily perform measurements in many diﬀerent places, thereby oﬀering substantial improvements in terms of the spatial granularity of the data gathered. Pollution monitoring near large industrial areas or in rural areas where transportation facilities are poor or inexistent can complicate the mobile sensing approach. To address this problem, in this paper we propose endowing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with pollution sensors, allowing them to become autonomous air monitoring stations. The proposed solution has the potential to quickly cover a target region at a low cost, and providing great ﬂexibility.","title":"Mobile Pollution Data Sensing Using UAVs","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing and Multimedia - MoMM 2015","creators":[{"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Alvear","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carlos T.","lastName":"Calafate","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Hernández","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Juan-Carlos","lastName":"Cano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Manzoni","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["BUQ52EQ6"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:25Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/MWNSZUVE","attachments":[{"key":"U8DP2STR","version":188,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Mobile Pollution Data Sensing Using UAVs.pdf","parentItem":"MWNSZUVE","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Mobile Pollution Data Sensing Using UAVs.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:19Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:26Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3305,"key":"MWNSZUVE"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598062,"version":0},"$loki":529},{"itemID":3300,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":188,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Mobile Pollution Data Sensing Using UAVs.pdf","parentItem":"MWNSZUVE","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Alvear et al. - 2015 - Mobile Pollution Data Sensing Using UAVs.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:19Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:26Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/U8DP2STR","itemID":3300,"key":"U8DP2STR"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598062,"version":0},"$loki":530},{"itemID":3306,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":179,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0373463303002212","volume":"56","issue":"2","pages":"257-275","publicationTitle":"Journal of Navigation","ISSN":"03734633, 14697785","date":"5/2003","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1017/S0373463303002212","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:43:27Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"An Extended Kalman Filter Algorithm for Integrating GPS and Low Cost Dead Reckoning System Data for Vehicle Performance and Emissions Monitoring","creators":[{"firstName":"L.","lastName":"Zhao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"W.

By combining smartphones with existing vehicles through an appropriate interface we are able to move closer to the smart vehicle paradigm, offering the user new functionalities and services when driving. In this paper we propose an Androidbased application that monitors the vehicle through an On Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) interface, being able to detect accidents. Our proposed application estimates the G force experienced by the passengers in case of a frontal collision, which is used together with airbag triggers to detect accidents. The application reacts to positive detection by sending details about the accident through either e-mail or SMS to pre-deﬁned destinations, immediately followed by an automatic phone call to the emergency services. Experimental results using a real vehicle show that the application is able to react to accident events in less than 3 seconds, a very low time, validating the feasibility of smartphone based solutions for improving safety on the road.","title":"Providing accident detection in vehicular networks through OBD-II devices and Android-based smartphones","proceedingsTitle":"2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Zaldivar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Carlos T.","lastName":"Calafate","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Juan Carlos","lastName":"Cano","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Manzoni","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:57Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/XUQVX7R6","attachments":[{"key":"WB5YVW29","version":188,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zaldivar et al. - 2011 - Providing accident detection in vehicular networks.pdf","parentItem":"XUQVX7R6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zaldivar et al. - 2011 - Providing accident detection in vehicular networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:42Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:58Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3334,"key":"XUQVX7R6"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598116,"version":0},"$loki":535},{"itemID":3312,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":188,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zaldivar et al. - 2011 - Providing accident detection in vehicular networks.pdf","parentItem":"XUQVX7R6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Zaldivar et al. - 2011 - Providing accident detection in vehicular networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:42Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WB5YVW29","itemID":3312,"key":"WB5YVW29"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598116,"version":0},"$loki":536},{"itemID":3335,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":420,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://jwcn-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1687-1499-2014-89","volume":"2014","issue":"1","publicationTitle":"EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking","ISSN":"1687-1499","date":"12/2014","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1186/1687-1499-2014-89","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:43:59Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Various wireless communication systems exist, which enable a wide range of applications and use cases in the vehicular environment. These applications can be grouped into three types, namely, road safety, traffic efficiency, and infotainment, each with its own set of functional and performance requirements. In pursuance of assisting drivers to travel safely and comfortably, several of these requirements have to be met simultaneously. While the coexistence of multiple radio access technologies brings immense opportunities towards meeting most of the vehicular networking application requirements, it is equally important and challenging to identify the strength and weaknesses of each technology and understand which technology is more suitable for the given networking scenario. In this paper, we evaluate two of the most viable communication standards, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11p and long-term evolution (LTE) by 3rd Generation Partnership Project for vehicular networking. A detailed performance evaluation study of the standards is given for a variety of parameter settings such as beacon transmission frequency, vehicle density, and vehicle average speed. Both standards are compared in terms of delay, reliability, scalability, and mobility support in the context of various application requirements. Furthermore, through extensive simulation-based study, we validated the effectiveness of both standards to handle different application requirements and share insight for further research directions. The results indicate that IEEE 802.11p offers acceptable performance for sparse network topologies with limited mobility support. On the other hand, LTE meets most of the application requirements in terms of reliability, scalability, and mobility support; however, it is challenging to obtain stringent delay requirements in the presence of higher cellular network traffic load.","title":"LTE and IEEE 802.11p for vehicular networking: a performance evaluation","shortTitle":"LTE and IEEE 802.11p for vehicular networking","creators":[{"firstName":"Zeeshan","lastName":"Hameed Mir","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fethi","lastName":"Filali","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["CXRYZG96"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:59Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:43:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WUB783CA","attachments":[{"key":"9DDUJ4AG","version":242,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hameed Mir and Filali -

It presents a comprehensive review of research efforts underway dealing with pedestrian safety and collision avoidance. The importance of pedestrian protection is emphasized in a global context, discussing the research programs and efforts in various countries. Pedestrian safety measures, including infrastructure enhancements and passive safety features in vehicles, are described, followed by a systematic description of active safety systems based on pedestrian detection using sensors in vehicle and infrastructure. The pedestrian detection approaches are classiﬁed according to various criteria such as the type and conﬁguration of sensors, as well as the video cues and classiﬁers used in detection algorithms. It is noted that collision avoidance not only requires detection of pedestrians but also requires collision prediction using pedestrian dynamics and behavior analysis. Hence, this paper includes research dealing with probabilistic modeling of pedestrian behavior for predicting collisions between pedestrians and vehicles.","title":"Pedestrian Protection Systems: Issues, Survey, and Challenges","shortTitle":"Pedestrian Protection Systems","creators":[{"firstName":"T.","lastName":"Gandhi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.M.","lastName":"Trivedi","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["RD8CJ48G"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:44:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/P68N6FGJ","attachments":[{"key":"DXSTNJMI","version":297,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gandhi and Trivedi - 2007 - Pedestrian Protection Systems Issues, Survey, and.pdf","parentItem":"P68N6FGJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gandhi and Trivedi - 2007 - Pedestrian Protection Systems Issues, Survey, and.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:44Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:04Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3338,"key":"P68N6FGJ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598186,"version":0},"$loki":543},{"itemID":3316,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":297,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gandhi and Trivedi - 2007 - Pedestrian Protection Systems Issues, Survey, and.pdf","parentItem":"P68N6FGJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gandhi and Trivedi - 2007 - Pedestrian Protection Systems Issues, Survey, and.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:44Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/DXSTNJMI","itemID":3316,"key":"DXSTNJMI"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598186,"version":0},"$loki":544},{"itemID":3343,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":179,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/9/24428","volume":"15","issue":"9","pages":"24428-24444","publicationTitle":"Sensors","ISSN":"1424-8220","date":"2015-09-22","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.3390/s150924428","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:44:10Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"The Global Positioning System (GPS) is recently used widely in structures and other applications. Notwithstanding, the GPS accuracy still suffers from the errors afflicting the measurements, particularly the short-period displacement of structural components. Previously, the multi filter method is utilized to remove the displacement errors. This paper aims at using a novel application for the neural network prediction models to improve the GPS monitoring time series data. Four prediction models for the learning algorithms are applied and used with neural network solutions: back-propagation, Cascade-forward back-propagation, adaptive filter and extended Kalman filter, to estimate which model can be recommended. The noise simulation and bridge’s short-period GPS of the monitoring displacement component of one Hz sampling frequency are used to validate the four models and the previous method. The results show that the Adaptive neural networks filter is suggested for de-noising the observations, specifically for the GPS displacement components of structures. Also, this model is expected to have significant influence on the design of structures in the low frequency responses and measurements’ contents.","title":"Optimizing the De-Noise Neural Network Model for GPS Time-Series Monitoring of Structures","creators":[{"firstName":"Mosbeh","lastName":"Kaloop","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jong","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["2QRYPJQZ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:44:10Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/HV8R6DB4","attachments":[{"key":"TKQW8UQ7","version":188,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Kaloop and Hu - 2015 - Optimizing the De-Noise Neural Network Model for G.pdf","parentItem":"HV8R6DB4","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kaloop and Hu - 2015 - Optimizing the De-Noise Neural Network Model for G.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:46Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:10Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3343,"key":"HV8R6DB4"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598202,"version":0},"$loki":545},{"itemID":3322,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":188,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Kaloop and Hu - 2015 - Optimizing the De-Noise Neural Network Model for G.pdf","parentItem":"HV8R6DB4","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kaloop and Hu - 2015 - Optimizing the De-Noise Neural Network Model for G.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:46Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/TKQW8UQ7","itemID":3322,"key":"TKQW8UQ7"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598202,"version":0},"$loki":546},{"itemID":3345,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":179,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780128034545000080","publisher":"Elsevier","pages":"149-171","ISBN":"978-0-12-803454-5","date":"2016","extra":"00000 \nDOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-803454-5.00008-0","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:44:13Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Vehicular networks are inseparable components of a smart city environment due to several applications that improve life quality, safety and security. Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traﬃc light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve eﬀective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, oﬄoading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource eﬃcient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures. Moreover open issues and future directions are presented and discussed to help stimulate future studies in this emerging research ﬁeld.","title":"From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in smart cities","bookTitle":"Smart Cities and Homes","creators":[{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Soyturk","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"K.N.","lastName":"Muhammad","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.N.","lastName":"Avcil","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"B.","lastName":"Kantarci","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Matthews","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/KGYDWZR4"]},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:44:13Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/YYDAQYEM","attachments":[{"key":"NTLKLK6V","version":188,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","parentItem":"YYDAQYEM","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:47Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:13Z"},{"key":"CTL48CKJ","version":284,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","parentItem":"YYDAQYEM","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:04Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:39Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3345,"key":"YYDAQYEM"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598216,"version":0},"$loki":547},{"itemID":3324,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":188,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","parentItem":"YYDAQYEM","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:43:47Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:44:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/NTLKLK6V","itemID":3324,"key":"NTLKLK6V"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598216,"version":0},"$loki":548},{"itemID":3385,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":284,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","parentItem":"YYDAQYEM","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Soyturk et al. - 2016 - From vehicular networks to vehicular clouds in sma.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:04Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CTL48CKJ","itemID":3385,"key":"CTL48CKJ"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598216,"version":0},"$loki":549},{"itemID":3346,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03081060500120282","volume":"28","issue":"3","pages":"167-187","publicationTitle":"Transportation Planning and Technology","ISSN":"0308-1060, 1029-0354","date":"06/2005","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1080/03081060500120282","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:44:14Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"This paper explores the technical feasibility of five Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) functions to contribute to road traffic safety, to reach stated European (EU) and national road traffic safety targets.

Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac­ curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth­ ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip­ tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework.

In the real world, the situation is different and most continuously collected data streams are generated by dynamic processes, which may change over time, in some cases even drastically. The change in the underlying concept, also known as concept drift, causes the data-mining model generated from past examples to become less accurate and relevant for classifying the current data. Most online learning algorithms deal with concept drift by generating a new model every time a concept drift is detected. On one hand, this solution ensures accurate and relevant models at all times, thus implying an increase in the classiﬁcation accuracy. On the other hand, this approach suffers from a major drawback, which is the high computational cost of generating new models. The problem is getting worse when a concept drift is detected more frequently and, hence, a compromise in terms of computational effort and accuracy is needed. This work describes a series of incremental algorithms that are shown empirically to produce more accurate classiﬁcation models than the batch algorithms in the presence of a concept drift while being computationally cheaper than existing incremental methods. The proposed incremental algorithms are based on an advanced decision-tree learning methodology called ‘‘Info-Fuzzy Network’’ (IFN), which is capable to induce compact and accurate classiﬁcation models. The algorithms are evaluated on real-world streams of trafﬁc and intrusion-detection data.","title":"Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data streams","creators":[{"firstName":"Lior","lastName":"Cohen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Avrahami","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Last","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abraham","lastName":"Kandel","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ET67I444"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:45:29Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:45:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CXAHW4NF","attachments":[{"key":"4XXG6XPW","version":211,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Cohen et al. - 2008 - Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data stre.pdf","parentItem":"CXAHW4NF","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cohen et al. - 2008 - Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data stre.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:45:21Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:45:29Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3366,"key":"CXAHW4NF"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598310,"version":0},"$loki":562},{"itemID":3354,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":211,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Cohen et al. - 2008 - Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data stre.pdf","parentItem":"CXAHW4NF","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cohen et al. - 2008 - Info-fuzzy algorithms for mining dynamic data stre.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:45:21Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:45:29Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4XXG6XPW","itemID":3354,"key":"4XXG6XPW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598310,"version":0},"$loki":563},{"itemID":3368,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-947X%282003%29129%3A6%28664%29","volume":"129","issue":"6","pages":"664-672","publicationTitle":"Journal of Transportation Engineering","ISSN":"0733-947X, 1943-5436","date":"11/2003","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:6(664)","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:45:31Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"This article presents the theoretical basis for modeling univariate trafﬁc condition data streams as seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average processes.

Over the last few years, trafﬁc data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing trafﬁc ﬂow prediction methods mainly use shallow trafﬁc prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the trafﬁc ﬂow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big trafﬁc data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based trafﬁc ﬂow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic trafﬁc ﬂow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent trafﬁc ﬂow features for prediction.

Cars have no power constraints and they can be instrumented with high end computational units and graphic devices. The deployment at scale of urban vehicular systems, however, requires a careful design able to consider challenges across several domains. Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our ﬁeld experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA). We designed and built the components for a pollution monitoring system able to support closed-loop optimization between pollution and trafﬁc management. Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban trafﬁc. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-ﬁeld experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.","title":"Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicular sensing: Lessons from urban deployments","shortTitle":"Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicular sensing","creators":[{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Pau","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Tse","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:10Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/H37PISN3","attachments":[{"key":"GILXBAN9","version":324,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pau and Tse - 2012 - Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicula.pdf","parentItem":"H37PISN3","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pau and Tse - 2012 - Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicula.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:02Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:10Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3392,"key":"H37PISN3"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598482,"version":0},"$loki":582},{"itemID":3378,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":324,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pau and Tse - 2012 - Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicula.pdf","parentItem":"H37PISN3","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Pau and Tse - 2012 - Challenges and opportunities in immersive vehicula.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:02Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/GILXBAN9","itemID":3378,"key":"GILXBAN9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598486,"version":0},"$loki":583},{"itemID":3393,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":420,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2498328.2500047","place":"Savannah, Georgia","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"1","ISBN":"978-1-4503-1901-0","date":"2013","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1145/2498328.2500047","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:46:11Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"the 51st ACM Southeast Conference","language":"en","abstractNote":"NoSQL database solutions are becoming more and more prevalent in a world currently dominated by SQL relational databases. NoSQL databases were designed to provide database solutions for large volumes of data that is not structured. However, the advantages (or disadvantages) of using a NoSQL database for data that is structured, and not necessarily “Big,” is not clear. There are not many studies that compare the performance of processing a modest amount of structured data in a NoSQL database with a traditional relational database. In this paper, we compare one of the NoSQL solutions, MongoDB, to the standard SQL relational database, SQL Server. We compare the performance, in terms of runtime, of these two databases for a modest-sized structured database.

Recent advances in communications, controls and embedded systems have changed this model, paving the way to the Intelligent Vehicle Grid. The car is now a formidable sensor platform, absorbing information from the environment (and from other cars) and feeding it to drivers and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control and trafﬁc management. The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Pioneered by the Google car, the Internet of Vehicles will be a distributed transport fabric capable to make its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g., the smart building), the Internet of Vehicles will have communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers’ intentions. The concept that will help transition to the Internet of Vehicles is the Vehicular Cloud, the equivalent of Internet cloud for vehicles, providing all the services required by the autonomous vehicles. In this article, we discuss the evolution from Intelligent Vehicle Grid to Autonomous, Internet-connected Vehicles, and Vehicular Cloud.","title":"Internet of vehicles: From intelligent grid to autonomous cars and vehicular clouds","proceedingsTitle":"2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)","shortTitle":"Internet of vehicles","creators":[{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Gerla","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eun-Kyu","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Pau","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Uichin","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:12Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/F2QV46VM","attachments":[{"key":"BGDCDTC9","version":264,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gerla et al. - 2014 - Internet of vehicles From intelligent grid to aut.pdf","parentItem":"F2QV46VM","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gerla et al. - 2014 - Internet of vehicles From intelligent grid to aut.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:13Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3394,"key":"F2QV46VM"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598518,"version":0},"$loki":586},{"itemID":3380,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":264,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gerla et al. - 2014 - Internet of vehicles From intelligent grid to aut.pdf","parentItem":"F2QV46VM","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gerla et al. - 2014 - Internet of vehicles From intelligent grid to aut.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:13Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BGDCDTC9","itemID":3380,"key":"BGDCDTC9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598520,"version":0},"$loki":587},{"itemID":3395,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5976214/","place":"Seoul, Korea (South)","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"450-455","ISBN":"978-1-61284-733-7","date":"06/2011","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/IMIS.2011.36","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:46:14Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing (IMIS)","language":"en","abstractNote":"The number of vehicles has been growing compared to limited road capacity, leading to severe trafﬁc congestion during rush hour. Urban planners are looking for solutions to reduce trafﬁc congestion. Realtime trafﬁc information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and trafﬁc control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current trafﬁc conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a ﬂow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle trafﬁc over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efﬁcacy in controlling the trafﬁc as the number of vehicles increases.","title":"NAVOPT: Navigator Assisted Vehicular Route OPTimizer","proceedingsTitle":"2011 Fifth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","shortTitle":"NAVOPT","creators":[{"firstName":"Wooseong","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Gerla","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:14Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/JAJKTECP","attachments":[{"key":"U28YNY9U","version":189,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Kim and Gerla - 2011 - NAVOPT Navigator Assisted Vehicular Route OPTimiz.pdf","parentItem":"JAJKTECP","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kim and Gerla - 2011 - NAVOPT Navigator Assisted Vehicular Route OPTimiz.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:14Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3395,"key":"JAJKTECP"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598536,"version":0},"$loki":588},{"itemID":3381,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":189,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Kim and Gerla - 2011 - NAVOPT Navigator Assisted Vehicular Route OPTimiz.pdf","parentItem":"JAJKTECP","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kim and Gerla - 2011 - NAVOPT Navigator Assisted Vehicular Route OPTimiz.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/U28YNY9U","itemID":3381,"key":"U28YNY9U"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598536,"version":0},"$loki":589},{"itemID":3397,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6504250/","place":"San Diego, CA","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"1123-1127","ISBN":"978-1-4673-5288-8 978-1-4673-5287-1 978-1-4673-5286-4","date":"1/2013","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504250","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:46:17Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2013 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC 2013)","language":"en","abstractNote":"Cloud computing allows user to access remote hardware, data and software through the network.

As an example, we describe the Pics-on-Wheels service, a Vehicular Cloud service that delivers images on demand to citizens by using vehicles’ on board cameras. A server (eg taxi dispatcher or Navigator Server) accepts requests from members and assigns the photo clicking task to vehicles close to the target. The feasibility of the Pics-on-Wheels service is demonstrated in a San Francisco scenario using published taxicab routes.","title":"Pics-on-wheels: Photo surveillance in the vehicular cloud","proceedingsTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)","shortTitle":"Pics-on-wheels","creators":[{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Gerla","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"Jui-Ting Weng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"G.","lastName":"Pau","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["T8I8GNGE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:17Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/65BD5LK6","attachments":[{"key":"YAXKVPA9","version":189,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gerla et al. - 2013 - Pics-on-wheels Photo surveillance in the vehicula.pdf","parentItem":"65BD5LK6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gerla et al. - 2013 - Pics-on-wheels Photo surveillance in the vehicula.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:17Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3397,"key":"65BD5LK6"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598560,"version":0},"$loki":590},{"itemID":3383,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":189,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gerla et al. - 2013 - Pics-on-wheels Photo surveillance in the vehicula.pdf","parentItem":"65BD5LK6","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gerla et al. - 2013 - Pics-on-wheels Photo surveillance in the vehicula.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:03Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:17Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/YAXKVPA9","itemID":3383,"key":"YAXKVPA9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598560,"version":0},"$loki":591},{"itemID":3401,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":420,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/13/1/393","volume":"13","issue":"1","pages":"393-425","publicationTitle":"Sensors","ISSN":"1424-8220","date":"2012-12-27","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.3390/s130100393","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:46:22Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"In a world where resources are scarce and urban areas consume the vast majority of these resources, it is vital to make cities greener and more sustainable. Advanced systems to improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart cities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later use, to intelligent control systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously, the possible improvements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous sensing poses numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an overview of the state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical challenges associated with these technologies. In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies play a role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated with these applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies belong to different disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts to bridge these to provide a broad overview, which can be of help to researchers and developers in understanding how advanced sensing can play a role in smart cities.","title":"The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities","creators":[{"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Hancke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Silva","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Hancke, Jr.","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["CXRYZG96"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:22Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/264F83MX","attachments":[{"key":"3XSTERPC","version":204,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hancke et al. - 2012 - The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf","parentItem":"264F83MX","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hancke et al. - 2012 - The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:05Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:22Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3401,"key":"264F83MX"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598588,"version":0},"$loki":592},{"itemID":3387,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":204,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Hancke et al. - 2012 - The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf","parentItem":"264F83MX","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hancke et al. - 2012 - The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-18T22:46:05Z","dateModified":"2018-12-18T22:46:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/3XSTERPC","itemID":3387,"key":"3XSTERPC"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598590,"version":0},"$loki":593},{"itemID":3402,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":180,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6257116/","place":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"152-155","ISBN":"978-1-4673-2039-9 978-1-4673-2038-2 978-1-4673-2037-5","date":"06/2012","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/MedHocNet.2012.6257116","accessDate":"2018-12-18T22:46:23Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2012 The 11th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)","language":"en","abstractNote":"Mobile Cloud Computing is a new ﬁeld of research that aims to study mobile agents (people, vehicles, robots) as they interact and collaborate to sense the environment, process the data, propagate the results and more generally share resources.

Underlying the formation of norms is the ubiquitous belief that there is a correct response for every situation and an abiding interest for persons to base their responses on these correct foundations. Given such a belief, a normative evaluation of a feeling, thought or action is likely to arise when persons perceive that their positive or negative attitudinal evaluation is shared by one or more influential others. If interpersonal agreements validate attitudes and transform attitudes into norms, then the development of a theory of norm formation may draw on extant “combinatorial” theories of consensus production that describe how shared attitudes are produced and maintained in groups. The network theory of social influence that I employ is one such combinatorial approach. An important sociological implication of this network theory is that the content of norms must be consistent with the social stratification (or more general pattern of inequality) of interpersonal influences in a group. I illustrate the theory with an analysis of Roethlisberger and Dickson’s (1939) classic observations on the Bank Wiring Observation Room.","title":"Norm formation in social influence networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Noah E.","lastName":"Friedkin","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"“Combinatorial” theories","type":1},{"tag":"Anderson’s weighted averaging model","type":1},{"tag":"Bank Wiring Observation Room","type":1}],"collections":["28M75EK7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:35Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/52IG5RAX","attachments":[{"key":"KMWGKMAD","version":367,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0378873301000363/1-s2.0-S0378873301000363-main.pdf?_tid=05181fc4-834e-4a7f-aa34-d559c6fa37f0&acdnat=1545303693_bf34dbd36fe034b193881d004788ec3a","accessDate":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","title":"Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf","parentItem":"52IG5RAX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z"},{"key":"BNPZHC4M","version":268,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873301000363","accessDate":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","parentItem":"52IG5RAX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0378873301000363.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3415,"key":"52IG5RAX"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598686,"version":0},"$loki":604},{"itemID":3417,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":367,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0378873301000363/1-s2.0-S0378873301000363-main.pdf?_tid=05181fc4-834e-4a7f-aa34-d559c6fa37f0&acdnat=1545303693_bf34dbd36fe034b193881d004788ec3a","accessDate":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","title":"Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf","parentItem":"52IG5RAX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/KMWGKMAD","itemID":3417,"key":"KMWGKMAD"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598686,"version":0},"$loki":605},{"itemID":3416,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":268,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873301000363","accessDate":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","parentItem":"52IG5RAX","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0378873301000363.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T10:58:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BNPZHC4M","itemID":3416,"key":"BNPZHC4M"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598688,"version":0},"$loki":606},{"itemID":3418,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":275,"itemType":"attachment","title":"AGPSinet.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"AGPSinet.pdf","tags":[],"collections":["28M75EK7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-20T11:00:08Z","dateModified":"2018-12-20T11:00:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BZHSNIJL","itemID":3418,"key":"BZHSNIJL"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598702,"version":0},"$loki":607},{"itemID":3420,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":181,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cpe.3370","volume":"27","issue":"15","pages":"3915-3942","publicationTitle":"Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience","ISSN":"15320626","date":"10/2015","extra":"00007","DOI":"10.1002/cpe.3370","accessDate":"2019-01-13T14:58:22Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"A survey of recommendation techniques based on offline data processing: A SURVEY OF RECOMMENDATION TECHNIQUES BASED ON OFFLINE DATA PROCESSING","shortTitle":"A survey of recommendation techniques based on offline data processing","creators":[{"firstName":"Yongli","lastName":"Ren","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wanlei","lastName":"Zhou","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["P7ZY83ZD"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EMF9A3T5"]},"dateAdded":"2019-01-13T14:58:22Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T17:00:41Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/DIG6R5EB","attachments":[{"key":"8EM6T4FM","version":237,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ren et al. -

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their speciﬁc tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the inﬂux of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed “edge router” incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure conﬁdentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efﬁcacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.","title":"Towards a Layered and Secure Internet-of-Things Testbed via Hybrid Mesh","proceedingsTitle":"2018 IEEE International Congress on Internet of Things (ICIOT)","creators":[{"firstName":"Tyler","lastName":"Jones","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aniket","lastName":"Dali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Manoj Ramesh","lastName":"Rao","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Neha","lastName":"Biradar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Madassery","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kaikai","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["VS2DYAYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-18T23:40:27Z","dateModified":"2019-01-18T23:40:28Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4XRPP36P","attachments":[{"key":"LPZF5AGW","version":451,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Jones et al. -

Crowdsourcing network coverage combined with crowdfunding costs can create sustainable yet decentralized Internet access infrastructures, where every participant can invest in resources, and pay and be paid for usage. While mesh networks and mesh routing protocols enable self-organized networks that expand organically, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts enable the economic coordination among network providers and consumers. We explore and evaluate two existing blockchain software stacks, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) and Ethereum geth with Proof of Authority (PoA), deployed in a real citywide production mesh network, and in a centralized laboratory network. We quantify the performance, bottlenecks and identify the current limitations and opportunities for improvement to serve the needs of wireless mesh networks.","title":"Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless Mesh Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Aniruddh Rao","lastName":"Kabbinale","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Emmanouil","lastName":"Dimogerontakis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mennan","lastName":"Selimi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Anwaar","lastName":"Ali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"Navarro","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arjuna","lastName":"Sathiaseelan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Cryptography and Security","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture","type":1}],"collections":["LPPBWFRS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:01:07Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:01:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/TYC7IVH9","attachments":[{"key":"87P92MXE","version":234,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04078.pdf","accessDate":"2019-01-19T13:01:04Z","title":"Kabbinale et al. - 2018 - Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless M.pdf","parentItem":"TYC7IVH9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kabbinale et al. - 2018 - Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless M.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:01:04Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:01:08Z"}],"notes":[{"key":"7I9NQTR7","version":190,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"TYC7IVH9","note":"Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1804.00561","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:01:07Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:01:07Z"}],"itemID":3441,"key":"TYC7IVH9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598808,"version":0},"$loki":621},{"itemID":3440,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":234,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04078.pdf","accessDate":"2019-01-19T13:01:04Z","title":"Kabbinale et al. - 2018 - Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless M.pdf","parentItem":"TYC7IVH9","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kabbinale et al. - 2018 - Blockchain for Economically Sustainable Wireless M.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:01:04Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:01:08Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/87P92MXE","itemID":3440,"key":"87P92MXE"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598810,"version":0},"$loki":622},{"itemID":3448,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":181,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8343211/","place":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"712-717","ISBN":"978-1-5386-2290-2","date":"1/2018","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/ICOIN.2018.8343211","accessDate":"2019-01-19T13:55:34Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2018 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)","language":"en","abstractNote":"The blockchain is decentralized network system that verifies the validity of the transaction through the consensus of the verifiers without trusted third parties. This mechanism ensures transaction integrity disclosing transaction information transparently. Therefore, it is emerging as the core technology of the 4th industrial revolution by improving reliability and efficiency with features of decentralization, ensuring the integrity, and economic cost reduction. However, there are some problems with the growth of the blockchain. The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction. This has the disadvantage that the system doesn’t operate without compensation. Also, the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Algorithm using private blockchain has a limited number of acceptable malicious users. In this case, if the users collude with malicious and exceed the limited number, the transaction is rejected. In this paper, we propose a Smart Manager System and RMBC-DBFT (Randomized Mesh Blockchain Diversity of opinion BFT) enables the safe transaction to the problems above.","title":"RMBC: Randomized mesh blockchain using DBFT consensus algorithm","proceedingsTitle":"2018 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)","shortTitle":"RMBC","creators":[{"firstName":"Sol","lastName":"Jeon","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Inshil","lastName":"Doh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kijoon","lastName":"Chae","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["LPPBWFRS"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:55:34Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:55:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/UURRELMV","attachments":[{"key":"VSXB6YH7","version":190,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Jeon et al. - 2018 - RMBC Randomized mesh blockchain using DBFT consen.pdf","parentItem":"UURRELMV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Jeon et al. - 2018 - RMBC Randomized mesh blockchain using DBFT consen.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:55:32Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:55:34Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3448,"key":"UURRELMV"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598826,"version":0},"$loki":623},{"itemID":3446,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":190,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Jeon et al. - 2018 - RMBC Randomized mesh blockchain using DBFT consen.pdf","parentItem":"UURRELMV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Jeon et al. - 2018 - RMBC Randomized mesh blockchain using DBFT consen.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T13:55:32Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T13:55:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/VSXB6YH7","itemID":3446,"key":"VSXB6YH7"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598828,"version":0},"$loki":624},{"itemID":3449,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":181,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449743/","place":"Chania, Greece","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"14-19","ISBN":"978-1-5386-4725-7","date":"6/2018","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2018.8449743","accessDate":"2019-01-19T13:55:35Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2018 IEEE 19th International Symposium on \"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks\" (WoWMoM)","language":"en","abstractNote":"A limitation of current LoRa networks is their single-hop nature.

Cars to be tracked are fitted with batterypowered tags that send each other plain LoRa messages and then report over LoRaWAN the observed RSSI to the server. The server estimates tag coordinates using multi-dimensional scaling and a novel corrective transformation based on tag clustering. We designed a low-cost tag for RSSI measurement and an energy efficient solution for managing a mesh of 1000 tags on one site using time division multiplexing. The tags are fully controlled and synchronized by the server. To stay synchronized for several hours until a next downlink the tags estimate and compensate the real-time clock error. Large-scale tests are yet to be performed, but lab-based and small-scale tests in real conditions show a maximal error of 8 meters and a battery lifetime of 5 years.","title":"Low-Cost Car Park Localization Using RSSI in Supervised LoRa Mesh Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Gotthard","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tomáš","lastName":"Jankech","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["7GPW9NTN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T14:03:33Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T14:03:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/LG2BFAEW","attachments":[{"key":"RK9YLZGT","version":190,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gotthard and Jankech - 2018 - Low-Cost Car Park Localization Using RSSI in Super.pdf","parentItem":"LG2BFAEW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gotthard and Jankech - 2018 - Low-Cost Car Park Localization Using RSSI in Super.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T14:03:31Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T14:03:34Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3456,"key":"LG2BFAEW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598880,"version":0},"$loki":629},{"itemID":3452,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":190,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gotthard and Jankech - 2018 - Low-Cost Car Park Localization Using RSSI in Super.pdf","parentItem":"LG2BFAEW","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Gotthard and Jankech - 2018 - Low-Cost Car Park Localization Using RSSI in Super.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T14:03:31Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T14:03:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/RK9YLZGT","itemID":3452,"key":"RK9YLZGT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598882,"version":0},"$loki":630},{"itemID":3457,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":409,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3055031.3055034","place":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","publisher":"ACM Press","pages":"259-260","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4890-4","date":"2017","extra":"00005","DOI":"10.1145/3055031.3055034","accessDate":"2019-01-19T14:03:35Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"the 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference","language":"en","abstractNote":"LoRa, an emerging wireless technology, is examined for long range communication performance in a large area. Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals. The results show our LoRa mesh networking module achieved a 88.49% packet delivery ratio (PDR), while the LoRaWAN in starnetwork topology was only 58.7% under the same conditions.","title":"A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-scale monitoring: demo abstract","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks  - IPSN '17","shortTitle":"A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-scale monitoring","creators":[{"firstName":"Kai-Hsiang","lastName":"Ke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Qi-Wen","lastName":"Liang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Guan-Jie","lastName":"Zeng","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jun-Han","lastName":"Lin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Huang-Chen","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["7GPW9NTN","ET67I444"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/23K44RYN","http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/I4W2LVSN"]},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T14:03:35Z","dateModified":"2019-02-07T23:05:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/75XEKI9Y","attachments":[{"key":"MNV4WHIT","version":190,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ke et al. - 2017 - A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-.pdf","parentItem":"75XEKI9Y","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ke et al. - 2017 - A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T14:03:31Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T14:03:35Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3457,"key":"75XEKI9Y"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598892,"version":0},"$loki":631},{"itemID":3453,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":190,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ke et al. - 2017 - A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-.pdf","parentItem":"75XEKI9Y","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Ke et al. - 2017 - A LoRa wireless mesh networking module for campus-.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T14:03:31Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T14:03:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/MNV4WHIT","itemID":3453,"key":"MNV4WHIT"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088598892,"version":0},"$loki":632},{"itemID":3459,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":181,"itemType":"conferencePaper","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8115793/","place":"Rome","publisher":"IEEE","pages":"1-8","ISBN":"978-1-5386-3839-2","date":"10/2017","extra":"00014","DOI":"10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115793","accessDate":"2019-01-19T14:03:37Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","conferenceName":"2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","language":"en","abstractNote":"The LoRa technology has emerged as an interesting solution for low power, long range IoT applications by proposing multiple ”degrees of freedom” at the physical layer. This ﬂexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the ﬂexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio conﬁgurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio conﬁgurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.","title":"Evaluating LoRa energy efficiency for adaptive networks: From star to mesh topologies","proceedingsTitle":"2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","shortTitle":"Evaluating LoRa energy efficiency for adaptive networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Moises Nunez","lastName":"Ochoa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Arturo","lastName":"Guizar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mickael","lastName":"Maman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Duda","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["7GPW9NTN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-19T14:03:37Z","dateModified":"2019-01-19T14:03:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/HK669NWV","attachments":[{"key":"IAAQ2PAE","version":339,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ochoa et al. -

The higher level of the PN representation consists of net modules, each one representing an intersection, a road, a signal staging, etc.; the description of each module in terms of deterministictimed Petri nets (DTPN) is given at the lower level. Such a representation leads to a corresponding two-level control procedure. The high-level control system, which acts over the modular representation, switches among internal module structures so as to modify some parts of the model of the trafﬁc system (e.g., signal plans, turning rates, etc.), depending on both state and time. The low-level control system, which acts over the DTPN representation, optimizes the performances of the trafﬁc system, by solving a mathematical programming problem which minimizes the number of vehicles in the system. In the paper, the adopted model of the signalized urban area is brieﬂy presented, and the two-level representation and the control system are described in details.","title":"Traffic-responsive signalling control through a modular/switching model represented via DTPN","proceedingsTitle":"2006 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference","creators":[{"firstName":"A.","lastName":"Di Febbraro","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Giglio","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["8GE7IDJI"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/EFIGHAUM"]},"dateAdded":"2019-01-27T19:47:17Z","dateModified":"2019-01-30T16:33:22Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4R5V7Q2G","attachments":[{"key":"K9CTUSI4","version":362,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Di Febbraro and Giglio -

A modular framework based on coloured timed Petri nets is proposed to model the dynamics of signalized traffic network systems: places represent link cells and crossing sections, tokens are vehicles and token colours represent the routing of the corresponding vehicle. In addition, an ordinary timed Petri net models the signal timing plan controlling the area. The proposed modelling framework is applied to a real intersection located in Bari, Italy. A discrete event simulation of the controlled intersection validates the model and tests the signal timing plan obtained by an optimization strategy presented in the related literature.","title":"An urban traffic network model via coloured timed petri nets","creators":[{"firstName":"Mariagrazia","lastName":"Dotoli","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria Pia","lastName":"Fanti","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"discrete event systems","type":1},{"tag":"modelling","type":1},{"tag":"Petri-nets","type":1},{"tag":"road traffic","type":1},{"tag":"traffic control","type":1}],"collections":["8GE7IDJI"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-27T19:52:38Z","dateModified":"2019-01-27T19:52:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/ZV6BYQFG","attachments":[{"key":"MY2656ZE","version":190,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://ac.els.cdn.com/S1474667017307474/1-s2.0-S1474667017307474-main.pdf?_tid=c407c50c-a517-49db-b068-82d9d217db09&acdnat=1548618937_f16fb9beb111cef098732e809d09e18b","accessDate":"2019-01-27T19:52:42Z","title":"Dotoli_Fanti_2004_An urban traffic network model via coloured timed petri nets.pdf","parentItem":"ZV6BYQFG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Dotoli_Fanti_2004_An urban traffic network model via coloured timed petri nets.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-27T19:52:42Z","dateModified":"2019-01-27T19:52:42Z"},{"key":"CRS6CQZ8","version":282,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017307474","accessDate":"2019-01-27T19:52:39Z","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","parentItem":"ZV6BYQFG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S1474667017307474.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-27T19:52:39Z","dateModified":"2019-01-27T19:52:39Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3485,"key":"ZV6BYQFG"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088599116,"version":0},"$loki":655},{"itemID":3487,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":190,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://ac.els.cdn.com/S1474667017307474/1-s2.0-S1474667017307474-main.pdf?_tid=c407c50c-a517-49db-b068-82d9d217db09&acdnat=1548618937_f16fb9beb111cef098732e809d09e18b","accessDate":"2019-01-27T19:52:42Z","title":"Dotoli_Fanti_2004_An urban traffic network model via coloured timed petri nets.pdf","parentItem":"ZV6BYQFG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Dotoli_Fanti_2004_An urban traffic network model via coloured timed petri nets.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-27T19:52:42Z","dateModified":"2019-01-27T19:52:42Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/MY2656ZE","itemID":3487,"key":"MY2656ZE"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088599118,"version":0},"$loki":656},{"itemID":3486,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":282,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017307474","accessDate":"2019-01-27T19:52:39Z","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","parentItem":"ZV6BYQFG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S1474667017307474.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-27T19:52:39Z","dateModified":"2019-01-27T19:52:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/CRS6CQZ8","itemID":3486,"key":"CRS6CQZ8"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088599118,"version":0},"$loki":657},{"itemID":3488,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":182,"itemType":"webpage","url":"https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.accesdistant.sorbonne-universite.fr/document/5309701","extra":"00017","accessDate":"2019-01-27T19:54:17Z","title":"On using petri nets for representing and controlling signalized urban areas: New model and results -

In general, two main categories of networks are used in the IoT: short-range and long-range low-power networks. IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities. Each network category has its unique characteristics and strengths and each category has its important role in the IoT world.","title":"Comparison of 6LoWPAN and LPWAN for the Internet of Things","creators":[{"firstName":"H.

In the last decade, there has been considerable research on how to synergize inter-ﬂow network coding and opportunistic routing in a single joint protocol outperforming each in any scenario. This paper explains the motivation behind the integration of these two techniques, and highlights certain scenarios in which the joint approach may even degrade the performance, emphasizing the fact that their synergistic effect cannot be accomplished with a naive and perfunctory combination. This survey paper also provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the joint protocols in terms of their fundamental components and associated challenges, and compares existing joint protocols. We also present concluding remarks along with an outline of future research directions.","title":"Joint Inter-Flow Network Coding and Opportunistic Routing in Multi-Hop Wireless Mesh Networks: A Comprehensive Survey","shortTitle":"Joint Inter-Flow Network Coding and Opportunistic Routing in Multi-Hop Wireless Mesh Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Somayeh","lastName":"Kafaie","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuanzhu","lastName":"Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Octavia A.","lastName":"Dobre","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohamed Hossam","lastName":"Ahmed","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["VS2DYAYM"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-30T16:32:44Z","dateModified":"2019-01-30T16:32:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/BB79HC8F","attachments":[{"key":"QY5REUJU","version":191,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Kafaie et al. - 2018 - Joint Inter-Flow Network Coding and Opportunistic .pdf","parentItem":"BB79HC8F","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kafaie et al. - 2018 - Joint Inter-Flow Network Coding and Opportunistic .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-30T16:32:32Z","dateModified":"2019-01-30T16:32:45Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3517,"key":"BB79HC8F"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088599256,"version":0},"$loki":677},{"itemID":3507,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":191,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Kafaie et al. - 2018 - Joint Inter-Flow Network Coding and Opportunistic .pdf","parentItem":"BB79HC8F","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kafaie et al. - 2018 - Joint Inter-Flow Network Coding and Opportunistic .pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-30T16:32:32Z","dateModified":"2019-01-30T16:32:45Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/QY5REUJU","itemID":3507,"key":"QY5REUJU"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551088599258,"version":0},"$loki":678},{"itemID":3518,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":420,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5770275/","volume":"14","issue":"2","pages":"299-310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","ISSN":"1553-877X","date":"22/2012","extra":"00204","DOI":"10.1109/SURV.2011.042711.00007","accessDate":"2019-01-30T16:32:46Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"With the advances in wireless technologies and the explosive growth of the Internet, wireless networks, especially Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), are going through an important evolution.

However, only a few studies are related to WMNs design and are mainly concerned with protocol design and routing metrics optimization.

Using practical applications and real-world examples, the article argues that blockchain's decentralized nature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The column provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. Using blockchain, it is also possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. The column also discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, interorganizational networks, and industries on the frontlines of blockchain.","title":"Can Blockchain Strengthen the Internet of

Although many related ideas have been proposed, there are very few literatures with theoretical and data support. This paper focuses on the research of model construction and performance evaluation. First, an IoT security model is established based on blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). In this model, many security risks of traditional IoT architectures can be avoided, and system performance is significantly improved in distributed large capacity storage, concurrency and query. Secondly, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated through the average latency and throughput, which are meaningful for further research and optimization of this direction. Analysis and test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the blockchain-based security model.","title":"IoT Security Model and Performance Evaluation: A Blockchain Approach","proceedingsTitle":"2018

attracted more and more attention for implementing automation based high quality eco-system, innovative and reliable services, and improved productivity. That is why, IoT is presently spanning over a diverse range of applications in the fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, military, industry, etc. The resources IoT requires in those applications are heterogeneous in nature, for example, storage, processor, network, sensor nodes, energy, etc. The obvious challenge is how to manage these limited resources efficiently. Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed.

It aims to integrate seamlessly both physical and digital worlds in one single ecosystem that makes up a new intelligent era of Internet. This technology offers a huge business value for organizations and provides opportunities for many existing applications such as energy, healthcare and other sectors. However, as new emergent technology, IoT suffers from several security issues which are most challenging than those from other fields regarding its complex environment and resources-constrained IoT devices. A lot of researches have been initiated in order to provide efficient security solutions in IoT, particularly to address resources constraints and scalability issues. Furthermore, some technologies related to networking and cryptocurrency fields such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain are revolutionizing the world of the Internet of Things thanks to their efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive top down survey of the most recent proposed security and privacy solutions in IoT. We discuss particularly the benefits that new approaches such as blockchain and Software Defined Networking can bring to the security and the privacy in IoT in terms of flexibility and scalability. Finally, we give a general classification of existing solutions and comparison based on important parameters.","title":"Internet of things security: A top-down survey","shortTitle":"Internet of things security","creators":[{"firstName":"Djamel Eddine","lastName":"Kouicem","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abdelmadjid","lastName":"Bouabdallah","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hicham","lastName":"Lakhlef","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Privacy","type":1},{"tag":"Blockchain","type":1},{"tag":"Security","type":1},{"tag":"Internet of Things","type":1},{"tag":"Cryptography","type":1},{"tag":"Software defined networking","type":1}],"collections":["S2389G8S"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-03-07T13:05:05Z","dateModified":"2019-03-07T13:05:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/ZCMN7CDL","attachments":[{"key":"6UWPMR2T","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01780365/file/survey.pdf","accessDate":"2019-03-07T13:08:39Z","title":"Kouicem et al_2018_Internet of things security.pdf","parentItem":"ZCMN7CDL","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kouicem et al_2018_Internet of things security.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-03-07T13:08:39Z","dateModified":"2019-03-07T13:08:39Z"},{"key":"WQ5HDPYL","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128618301208","accessDate":"2019-03-07T13:08:35Z","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","parentItem":"ZCMN7CDL","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S1389128618301208.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-03-07T13:08:35Z","dateModified":"2019-03-07T13:08:36Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":3640,"key":"ZCMN7CDL"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551973824392,"version":0},"$loki":722},{"itemID":3642,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01780365/file/survey.pdf","accessDate":"2019-03-07T13:08:39Z","title":"Kouicem et al_2018_Internet of things security.pdf","parentItem":"ZCMN7CDL","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kouicem et al_2018_Internet of things security.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-03-07T13:08:39Z","dateModified":"2019-03-07T13:08:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/6UWPMR2T","itemID":3642,"key":"6UWPMR2T"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551973824392,"version":0},"$loki":723},{"itemID":3641,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128618301208","accessDate":"2019-03-07T13:08:35Z","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","parentItem":"ZCMN7CDL","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S1389128618301208.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-03-07T13:08:35Z","dateModified":"2019-03-07T13:08:36Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/WQ5HDPYL","itemID":3641,"key":"WQ5HDPYL"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1551973824394,"version":0},"$loki":724},{"itemID":3645,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"bookSection","url":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-13-1882-5_39","volume":"750","place":"Singapore","publisher":"Springer Singapore","pages":"457-467","ISBN":"9789811318818 9789811318825","date":"2019","extra":"00000 \nDOI: 10.1007/978-981-13-1882-5_39","accessDate":"2019-03-07T13:19:58Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","title":"A Survey on Research Challenges and Applications in Empowering the SDN-Based Internet of Things","bookTitle":"Advances in Big Data and Cloud Computing","creators":[{"firstName":"J.

In this study we explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation. Drawing on a sample survey of undergraduate Facebook users, we examine a particular privacy-enhancing practice: having a friends-only Facebook profile. Particularly, we look at the association between network composition, expectancy violations, interpersonal privacy practices and having a friends-only profile. We find that expectancy violations by weak ties and increased levels of interpersonal privacy management are positively associated with having a friends-only profile. We conclude with a discussion of how these findings may be integrated into the design of systems to facilitate interaction while enhancing individual privacy.","title":"Friends only: examining a privacy-enhancing behavior in facebook","proceedingsTitle":"Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - CHI '10","shortTitle":"Friends only","creators":[{"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Stutzman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Kramer-Duffield","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["64KQ9FFC"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-10T12:40:35Z","dateModified":"2018-09-10T12:40:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/THFX9UQG","attachments":[{"key":"5QPWN3FZ","version":216,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://fredstutzman.com/papers/CHI2010_Stutzman.pdf","accessDate":"2018-09-10T12:40:34Z","title":"Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield - 2010 - Friends only examining a privacy-enhancing behavi.pdf","parentItem":"THFX9UQG","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield - 2010 - Friends only examining a privacy-enhancing behavi.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-10T12:40:34Z","dateModified":"2018-09-10T12:40:36Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2950,"key":"THFX9UQG"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213606,"version":0},"$loki":729},{"itemID":2957,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"journalArticle","pages":"1-1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials","ISSN":"1553-877X","date":"2018","extra":"00000","DOI":"10.1109/COMST.2018.2855563","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","abstractNote":"As the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth, it is no surprise that many recent cyber attacks are IoT-enabled: The attacker initially exploits some vulnerable IoT technology as a first step towards compromising a critical system that is connected, in some way, with the IoT. For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.","title":"A Survey of IoT-enabled Cyberattacks: Assessing Attack Paths to Critical Infrastructures and Services","shortTitle":"A Survey of IoT-enabled Cyberattacks","creators":[{"firstName":"I.","lastName":"Stellios","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"P.","lastName":"Kotzanikolaou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Psarakis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"C.","lastName":"Alcaraz","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.","lastName":"Lopez","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Protocols","type":1},{"tag":"Sensors","type":1},{"tag":"Critical infrastructure","type":1},{"tag":"Critical Infrastructures.","type":1},{"tag":"Cyber Attacks","type":1},{"tag":"Cyberattack","type":1},{"tag":"Intelligent Transportation Systems","type":1},{"tag":"Internet of Things","type":1},{"tag":"SCADA","type":1},{"tag":"Smart Grids","type":1},{"tag":"Smart Home","type":1},{"tag":"Smart Medical Systems","type":1},{"tag":"Wireless sensor networks","type":1}],"collections":["SALMS4Q7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-16T15:08:51Z","dateModified":"2018-09-16T15:08:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/4FIL58LV","attachments":[{"key":"CJFU9GDS","version":281,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/9739/5451756/08410404.pdf?tp=&arnumber=8410404&isnumber=5451756","accessDate":"2018-09-16T15:09:28Z","title":"Stellios et al_2018_A Survey of IoT-enabled Cyberattacks.pdf","parentItem":"4FIL58LV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Stellios et al_2018_A Survey of IoT-enabled Cyberattacks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-16T15:09:28Z","dateModified":"2018-09-16T15:09:28Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2957,"key":"4FIL58LV"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213622,"version":0},"$loki":730},{"itemID":2963,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"20","issue":"3","pages":"41-47","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","ISSN":"0890-8044","date":"May 2006","extra":"00559","DOI":"10.1109/MNET.2006.1637931","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","abstractNote":"Wireless sensor networks are built upon a shared medium that makes it easy for adversaries to conduct radio interference, or jamming, attacks that effectively cause a denial of service of either transmission or reception functionalities. These attacks can easily be accomplished by an adversary by either bypassing MAC-layer protocols or emitting a radio signal targeted at jamming a particular channel. In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.","title":"Jamming sensor networks: attack and defense strategies","shortTitle":"Jamming sensor networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Wenyuan","lastName":"Xu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Ma","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"W.","lastName":"Trappe","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yanyong","lastName":"Zhang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Wireless sensor networks","type":1},{"tag":"access protocols","type":1},{"tag":"channel surfing","type":1},{"tag":"defense strategy","type":1},{"tag":"Energy conservation","type":1},{"tag":"jamming","type":1},{"tag":"Jamming","type":1},{"tag":"jamming sensor networks","type":1},{"tag":"MAC-layer protocols","type":1},{"tag":"Media Access Protocol","type":1},{"tag":"Packet switching","type":1},{"tag":"Power supplies","type":1},{"tag":"radio interference","type":1},{"tag":"Resumes","type":1},{"tag":"Signal generators","type":1},{"tag":"spatial evasion","type":1},{"tag":"spatial retreats","type":1},{"tag":"Switches","type":1},{"tag":"Wireless communication","type":1},{"tag":"wireless sensor networks","type":1}],"collections":["SALMS4Q7"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-16T17:16:18Z","dateModified":"2018-09-16T17:16:20Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/5064963/items/MTCDE5C4","attachments":[{"key":"SYTFJXL4","version":183,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx5/65/34335/01637931.pdf?tp=&arnumber=1637931&isnumber=34335","accessDate":"2018-09-16T17:16:28Z","title":"Xu et al_2006_Jamming sensor networks.pdf","parentItem":"MTCDE5C4","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Xu et al_2006_Jamming sensor networks.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-16T17:16:28Z","dateModified":"2018-09-16T17:16:28Z"}],"notes":[],"itemID":2963,"key":"MTCDE5C4"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213666,"version":0},"$loki":731},{"itemID":2968,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":false,"item":{"version":175,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"104","issue":"5","pages":"1013-1024","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","ISSN":"0018-9219","date":"May 2016","extra":"00091","DOI":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2497161","libraryCatalog":"IEEE Xplore","abstractNote":"With recent adoption of wireless sensor-actuator networks (WSANs) in industrial automation, industrial wireless control systems have emerged as a frontier of cyber-physical systems.

In this paper we provide a clear and structured overview of all the new 802.15.4e mechanisms. After a general introduction to the 802.15.4e standard, we describe the details of the main 802.15.4e MAC behavior modes, namely Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (DSME), and Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN).

The big data transmitted to the cloud or fog will consume massive network bandwidth. This may result in the IoT network easily encountering network congestion. Moreover, there are IoT applications that need to transfer multimedia data with multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements. A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed. The AQRA improves the average end-to-end flow performance by 10.75%, 11.88% and 10.82% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. The AQRA improves the standard deviation of end-to-end flow performance by 14.37%, 17.95% and 14.28% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. In addition, the runtime of the AQRA is 38.56% shorter than that of MINA.","title":"An Application-aware QoS Routing Algorithm for SDN-based IoT Networking","proceedingsTitle":"2018 IEEE Symposium on
