In this work, we aim to find out if text contains private content by using our novel learning based approach `privacy detective' that combines topic modeling, named entity recognition, privacy ontology, sentiment analysis, and text normalization to represent privacy features. Privacy detective investigates a broader range of privacy concerns compared to previous approaches that focus on keyword searching or profile related properties. We collected 500,000 tweets from 100,000 Twitter users along with other information such as tweet linkages and follower relationships. We reach 95.45\\% accuracy in a two-class task classifying Twitter users who do not reveal much private information and Twitter users who share sensitive information. We score timelines according to three privacy levels after having Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers annotate collected tweets according to privacy categories. Supervised machine learning classification results on these annotations reach 69.63\\% accuracy on a three-class task. Inter-annotator agreement on timeline privacy scores between various AMT workers and our classifiers fall under the same positive agreement level. Additionally, we show that a user's privacy level is correlated with her friends' privacy scores and also with the privacy scores of people mentioned in her text but not with the number of her followers.

Unfortunately, this wealth of social information is fragmented across many different proprietary applications. Combined, it could provide a more accurate representation of the social world, and it could enable a whole new set of socially-aware applications. We introduce Prometheus, a peer-to-peer service that collects and manages social information from multiple sources and implements a set of social inference functions while enforcing user-defined access control policies. Prometheus is socially-aware: it allows users to select peers that manage their social information based on social trust and exploits naturally-formed social groups for improved performance. We tested our Prometheus prototype on PlanetLab and built a mobile social application to test the performance of its social inference functions under realtime constraints. We showed that the social-based mapping of users onto peers improves the service response time and high service availability is achieved with low overhead.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the {{ACM}}/{{IFIP}}/{{USENIX}} 11th {{International Conference}} on {{Middleware}}},\n  series = {Middleware '10},\n  publisher = {{Springer-Verlag}},\n  urldate = {2018-03-06},\n  date = {2010},\n  pages = {212--231},\n  author = {Kourtellis, Nicolas and Finnis, Joshua and Anderson, Paul and Blackburn, Jeremy and Borcea, Cristian and Iamnitchi, Adriana},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/7C4FJNYW/Kourtellis et al. - 2010 - Prometheus User-controlled P2P Social Data Manage.pdf},\n  note = {00070}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138212362,"version":0},"$loki":686},{"itemID":774,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{frey_social_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Social {{Market}}: {{Combining Explicit}} and {{Implicit Social Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-3-642-24549-7 978-3-642-24550-3},\n  url = {https://link-springer-com.accesdistant.upmc.fr/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24550-3_16},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-3-642-24550-3_16},\n  shorttitle = {Social {{Market}}},\n  abstract = {The pervasiveness of the Internet has lead research and applications to focus more and more on their users. Online social networks such as Facebook provide users with the ability to maintain an unprecedented number of social connections. Recommendation systems exploit the opinions of other users to suggest movies or products based on our similarity with them. This shift from machines to users motivates the emergence of novel applications and research challenges.In this paper, we embrace the social aspects of the Web 2.0 by considering a novel problem. We build a distributed social market that combines interest-based social networks with explicit networks like Facebook. Our Social Market (SM) allows users to identify and build connections to other users that can provide interesting goods, or information. At the same time, it backs up these connections with trust, by associating them with paths of trusted users that connect new acquaintances through the explicit network. This convergence of implicit and explicit networks yields TAPS, a novel gossip protocol that can be applied in applications devoted to commercial transactions, or to add robustness to standard gossip applications like dissemination or recommendation systems.},\n  eventtitle = {Symposium on {{Self}}-{{Stabilizing Systems}}},\n  booktitle = {Stabilization, {{Safety}}, and {{Security}} of {{Distributed Systems}}},\n  series = {Lecture {{Notes}} in {{Computer Science}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-03-06},\n  date = {2011-10-10},\n  pages = {193-207},\n  author = {Frey, Davide and J\\'egou, Arnaud and Kermarrec, Anne-Marie},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/LZ2C9SKL/Frey et al. - 2011 - Social Market Combining Explicit and Implicit Soc.pdf;/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/H8HUJZZ8/10.html},\n  note = {00019}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138212388,"version":0},"$loki":687},{"itemID":816,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{li_soap_2011,\n  title = {Soap: {{A}} Social Network Aided Personalized and Effective Spam Filter to Clean Your e-Mail Box},\n  shorttitle = {Soap},\n  booktitle = {{{INFOCOM}}, 2011 {{Proceedings IEEE}}},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  date = {2011},\n  pages = {1835--1843},\n  author = {Li, Ze and Shen, Haiying},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/7HB2SQGR/Li and Shen - 2011 - Soap A social network aided personalized and effe.pdf},\n  note = {00054}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138212408,"version":0},"$loki":688},{"itemID":824,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{li_leveraging_2013,\n  title = {Leveraging {{Social Networks}} to {{Combat Collusion}} in {{Reputation Systems}} for {{Peer}}-to-{{Peer Networks}}},\n  volume = {62},\n  issn = {0018-9340},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6226368/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TC.2012.158},\n  number = {9},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Computers},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Many web spam demotion algorithms have been developed to combat spam via the use of the web link structure, from which the goodness or badness score of each web page is evaluated. Those scores are then used to identify spam pages or punish their rankings in search engine results. However, most of the published spam demotion algorithms differ from their base models by only very limited improvements and still suffer from some common score manipulation methods. The lack of a general framework for this field makes the task of designing high-performance spam demotion algorithms very inefficient. In this paper, we propose a unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithms by abstracting the score propagation process of relevant models with a forward score propagation function and a backward score propagation function, each of which can further be expressed as three sub-functions: a splitting function, an accepting function and a combination function. On the basis of the proposed model, we develop two new web spam demotion algorithms named Supervised Forward and Backward score Ranking (SFBR) and Unsupervised Forward and Backward score Ranking (UFBR). Our experiments, conducted on three large-scale public datasets, show that (1) SFBR is very robust and apparently outperforms other algorithms and (2) UFBR can obtain results comparable to some well-known supervised algorithms in the spam demotion task even if the UFBR is unsupervised.},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {Information Retrieval Journal},\n  shortjournal = {Inf Retrieval J},\n  urldate = {2018-03-07},\n  date = {2017-12-01},\n  pages = {547-574},\n  author = {Zhuang, Xu and Zhu, Yan and Chang, Chin-Chen and Peng, Qiang and Khurshid, Faisal},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/6YBDFJRH/Zhuang et al_2017_A unified score propagation model for web spam demotion algorithm.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138212474,"version":0},"$loki":692},{"itemID":1208,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{gandouz_protect_2012,\n  title = {{{PROTECT}}\\_{{U}}: {{Un}} Systeme Communautaire Pour La Protection Des Usagers de {{Facebook}}},\n  abstract = {We introduce Protect\\_U (H\\'elou, Gandouz et al. 2012), a privacy protection system for Facebook users.

One of the fundamental difficulties is quantifying the amount of information revealed unintentionally. We present PrivAware, a tool to detect and report unintended information loss in online social networks. Our goal is to provide a rudimentary framework to identify privacy risk and provide solutions to reduce information loss. The first instance of the software is focused on information loss attributed to social circles. In subsequent releases we intend to incorporate additional capabilities to capture ancillary threat models. From our initial results, we quantify the privacy risk attributed to friend relationships in Facebook. We show that for each user in our study a majority of their personal attributes can be derived from social contacts. Moreover, we present results denoting the number of friends contributing to a correctly inferred attribute. We also provide similar results for different demographics of users. The intent of PrivAware is to not only report information loss but to recommend user actions to mitigate privacy risk. The actions provide users with the steps necessary to improve their overall privacy measurement. One obvious, but not ideal, solution is to remove risky friends. Another approach is to group risky friends and apply access controls to the group to limit visibility. In summary, our goal is to provide a unique tool to quantify information loss and provide features to reduce privacy risk.},\n  date = {2009},\n  pages = {8},\n  author = {Becker, Justin and Chen, Hao},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/GESQM5C9/Becker - 2009 - Measuring privacy risk in online social networks.pdf},\n  note = {00119}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138212498,"version":0},"$loki":694},{"itemID":1254,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kourtellis_design_2012,\n  title = {On the {{Design}} of {{Socially}}-{{Aware Distributed Systems}}},\n  date = {2012},\n  pages = {193},\n  author = {Kourtellis, Nicolas},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/VV9SC8NF/Kourtellis - 2012 - On the Design of Socially-Aware Distributed System.pdf},\n  note = {00011}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138212512,"version":0},"$loki":695},{"itemID":1778,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{zyskind_decentralizing_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Decentralizing {{Privacy}}: {{Using Blockchain}} to {{Protect Personal Data}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-9933-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7163223/},\n  doi = {10.1109/SPW.2015.27},\n  shorttitle = {Decentralizing {{Privacy}}},\n  abstract = {The recent increase in reported incidents of surveillance and security breaches compromising users' privacy call into question the current model, in which third-parties collect and control massive amounts of personal data.

This paper investigates ways to infer the reputation of an email sender based solely on network-level features, without looking at the contents of a message. First, we study first-order properties of network-level features that may help distinguish spammers from legitimate senders. We examine features that can be ascertained without ever looking at a packet's contents, such as the distance in IP space to other email senders or the geographic distance between sender and receiver. We derive features that are lightweight, since they do not require seeing a large amount of email from a single IP address and can be gleaned without looking at an email's contents\\textemdash{}many such features are apparent from even a single packet. Second, we incorporate these features into a classification algorithm and evaluate the classifier's ability to automatically classify email senders as spammers or legitimate senders. We build an automated reputation engine, SNARE, based on these features using labeled data from a deployed commercial spam-filtering system. We demonstrate that SNARE can achieve comparable accuracy to existing static IP blacklists: about a 70\\% detection rate for less than a 0.3\\% false positive rate.

A variant of recommender systems that generates recommendations from a set of trusted people is recently getting more attention in social networks. However, people are concerned about their privacy as the information revealed in recommender systems, particularly in social networks, can be misused easily. A way to eliminate the privacy risks is to make the privacy-sensitive data inaccessible by means of encryption. While the private data is inaccessible to any outsiders and the server, the same functionality of the system can be achieved by processing the encrypted data. Unfortunately, the efficiency of processing encrypted data constitutes a big challenge. In this paper, we present a privacy-enhanced recommender system in a social trust network, which is designed to be highly efficient. The cryptographic protocol for generating recommendations is based on homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation techniques. The additional overhead with regard to computation and communication is minimized by packing data.

In this research, we aim to address some critical issues related to privacy protection: Would the highest privacy settings guarantee a secure protection? Given the open nature of social networking sites, is it possible to manage one's privacy protection? With the diversity of one's social media friends, how can one figure out an effective approach to balance between vulnerability and privacy? We present a novel way to define a vulnerable friend from an individual user's perspective is dependent on whether or not the user's friends' privacy settings protect the friend and the individual's network of friends (which includes the user). As a single vulnerable friend in a user's social network might place all friends at risk, we resort to experiments and observe how much security an individual user can improve by unfriending a vulnerable friend. We also show how privacy weakens if newly accepted friends are unguarded or unprotected. This work provides a large-scale evaluation of new security and privacy indexes using a Facebook dataset. We present and discuss a new perspective for reasoning about social networking security. When a user accepts a new friend, the user should ensure that the new friend is not an increased security risk with the potential of negatively impacting the entire friend network. Additionally, by leveraging the indexes proposed and employing new strategies for unfriending vulnerable friends, it is possible to further improve security and privacy without changing the social networking site's existing architecture.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 17th {{ACM SIGKDD International Conference}} on {{Knowledge Discovery}} and {{Data Mining}}},\n  series = {{{KDD}} '11},\n  publisher = {{ACM}},\n  urldate = {2018-05-24},\n  date = {2011},\n  pages = {511--519},\n  keywords = {privacy,social network,vulnerability},\n  author = {Gundecha, Pritam and Barbier, Geoffrey and Liu, Huan},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/7MGY7XVZ/Gundecha et al_2011_Exploiting Vulnerability to Secure User Privacy on a Social Networking Site.pdf},\n  note = {00065}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138212642,"version":0},"$loki":703},{"itemID":1895,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{cho_survey_2015,\n  title = {A {{Survey}} on {{Trust Modeling}}},\n  volume = {48},\n  issn = {0360-0300},\n  url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2815595},\n  doi = {10.1145/2815595},\n  abstract = {The concept of trust and/or trust management has received considerable attention in engineering research communities as trust is perceived as the basis for decision making in many contexts and the motivation for maintaining long-term relationships based on cooperation and collaboration. Even if substantial research effort has been dedicated to addressing trust-based mechanisms or trust metrics (or computation) in diverse contexts, prior work has not clearly solved the issue of how to model and quantify trust with sufficient detail and context-based adequateness. The issue of trust quantification has become more complicated as we have the need to derive trust from complex, composite networks that may involve four distinct layers of communication protocols, information exchange, social interactions, and cognitive motivations. In addition, the diverse application domains require different aspects of trust for decision making such as emotional, logical, and relational trust. This survey aims to outline the foundations of trust models for applications in these contexts in terms of the concept of trust, trust assessment, trust constructs, trust scales, trust properties, trust formulation, and applications of trust. We discuss how different components of trust can be mapped to different layers of a complex, composite network; applicability of trust metrics and models; research challenges; and future work directions.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {ACM Comput.

In this paper, we identify three vulnerabilities that are detrimental to decentralized reputation management and propose TrustGuard - a safeguard framework for providing a highly dependable and yet efficient reputation system. First, we provide a dependable trust model and a set of formal methods to handle strategic malicious nodes that continuously change their behavior to gain unfair advantages in the system. Second, a transaction based reputation system must cope with the vulnerability that malicious nodes may misuse the system by flooding feedbacks with fake transactions. Third, but not least, we identify the importance of filtering out dishonest feedbacks when computing reputation-based trust of a node, including the feedbacks filed by malicious nodes through collusion. Our experiments show that, comparing with existing reputation systems, our framework is highly dependable and effective in countering malicious nodes regarding strategic oscillating behavior, flooding malevolent feedbacks with fake transactions, and dishonest feedbacks.},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2018-06-08},\n  date = {2005},\n  pages = {422},\n  author = {Srivatsa, Mudhakar and Xiong, Li and Liu, Ling},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/UBIP7DFZ/Srivatsa et al. - 2005 - TrustGuard countering vulnerabilities in reputati.pdf},\n  note = {00388}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138212874,"version":0},"$loki":717},{"itemID":1984,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{shanshansong_trusted_2005,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Trusted {{P2P Transactions}} with {{Fuzzy Reputation Aggregation}}},\n  volume = {9},\n  issn = {1089-7801},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1541943/},\n  doi = {10.1109/MIC.2005.136},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Internet Computing},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Internet Comput.},\n  urldate = {2018-06-08},\n  date = {2005-11},\n  pages = {24-34},\n  author = {{Shanshan Song} and {Kai Hwang} and {Runfang Zhou} and {Yu-Kwong Kwok}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/UG856ERP/Shanshan Song et al. - 2005 - Trusted P2P Transactions with Fuzzy Reputation Agg.pdf},\n  note = {00529}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138212884,"version":0},"$loki":718},{"itemID":1986,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{zhou_gossipbased_2008,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Gossip-{{Based Reputation Management}} for {{Unstructured Peer}}-to-{{Peer Networks}}},\n  abstract = {To build an efficient reputation system for peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, we need fast mechanisms to aggregate peer evaluations and to disseminate updated scores to a large number of peer nodes.

However, it cannot make recommendations for so-called cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In addition, these methods do not know how confident they are in their recommendations. Trust-based recommendation methods assume the additional knowledge of a trust network among users and can better deal with cold start users, since users only need to be simply connected to the trust network. On the other hand, the sparsity of the user item ratings forces the trustbased approach to consider ratings of indirect neighbors that are only weakly trusted, which may decrease its precision.

In this case, if there is access to the network structure, the results show that global metrics such as closeness have a high degree of correlation with PRS. Otherwise, local and social centrality metrics based on ego-networks provide a suitable approximation to PRS. The results in real social networks confirm that local and social centrality metrics based on degree perform well in estimating the privacy risk of users.},\n  journaltitle = {Future Generation Computer Systems},\n  shortjournal = {Future Generation Computer Systems},\n  urldate = {2018-06-11},\n  date = {2018-05-01},\n  pages = {63-76},\n  keywords = {Privacy,Social networks,Information sharing},\n  author = {Alemany, J. and family=Val, given=E., prefix=del, useprefix=true and Alberola, J. and Garc\\'ia-Fornes, A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/BZJ38VUD/Alemany et al_2018_Estimation of privacy risk through centrality metrics.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213022,"version":0},"$loki":726},{"itemID":2014,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{zhang_privacypreserving_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A {{Privacy}}-Preserving {{Interactive Messaging Scheme Based}} on {{Users Credibility}} over {{Online Social Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Due to the tremendous growth in user population over online social networks (OSNs), interactive messaging traffic has experienced exponential increase, which consequently elevates the privacy leakage.

Our approach, dubbed SoEmail, provides social context to messages using an OSN's underlying social graph. This not only gives the recipient control over who can message her, but it also provides her with an understanding of where the message originated from, socially. Furthermore, users who do not wish to use the built-in social aspect of SoEmail, can send and receive emails without any changes to their behavior. The modifications we made to the email application to provide this social context are not invasive and can be easily ignored by any existing email client. We built SoEmail on top of an existing framework, known as Davis Social Links, which allows SoEmail to be completely agnostic about the underlying OSN. We created a web-based, standards-based web client for SoEmail using Facebook and Gmail as the underlying systems which has been released for public use and has had a good adoption rate.},\n  booktitle = {Social {{Informatics}}},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-06-12},\n  date = {2010},\n  pages = {203-215},\n  author = {Tran, Thomas and Rowe, Jeff and Wu, S.

We conduct simulation and verify the proposed method can objectify feedback-based trust preciously with optimized parameters by using lambda square discrepancy measure.},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-06-13},\n  date = {2017-07},\n  pages = {321-325},\n  author = {Ahn, Jaewon and Oh, Hyeontaek and Park, Hong-Shik},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/TENDB3GF/Ahn et al. - 2017 - Objectification of feedback based trust evaluation.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213216,"version":0},"$loki":739},{"itemID":2173,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{khaksari_tpta_2017,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {{{TP}}-{{TA}}: A Comparative Analytical Framework for Trust Prediction Models in Online Social Networks Based on Trust Aspects},\n  issn = {0269-2821, 1573-7462},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10462-017-9583-1},\n  doi = {10.1007/s10462-017-9583-1},\n  shorttitle = {{{TP}}-{{TA}}},\n  abstract = {Formation of online social network (OSN) strongly depends on the quality of relationships between its agents. Such relationships are affected by a host of factors; trust is one of them. To enhance the quality of relationships in such networks, it is important to find a mechanism to predict the degree of trust among participating agents since trust is the major driving force for initiating and developing social relationships. Although much effort has been made to develop quantitative techniques to obtain trust value, there is a lack of coherent classification of such techniques to achieve a macro vision of trust prediction models and identify their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we proposed TP-TA, an analytical framework which consists of three main components: First, classification of various existing trust prediction models in terms of trust aspects in the context of OSNs. Besides, main ideas, prospects, and challenges of each approach are highlighted for further research in this field. Second, defining general criteria to analyze our proposed classification. Finally, we illustrate a qualitative comparison between each approach which is a guide to understanding their superiority to one another. This framework could lead to an efficient selection of trust prediction techniques based on the nature of the target OSN and the intended trust type.},\n  journaltitle = {Artificial Intelligence Review},\n  shortjournal = {Artif.

Social media networks are already the largest network among the population across our globe and for sure, it will not stop expanding its territory. Security vulnerabilities on the other side have been mounting in parallel. A comprehensive effort to change ourselves along with reversing the process or architecture of social media network sites might be the solution of this serious but unavoidable problem. We can create a trusted social media network model that will ensure trust level of a user to connect with other users. Users can trust each other based on the trust level. A lot of research has been done on trust model for social media networks and till now none is established effectively as most of them fail to capture user's trustworthiness with full proof. In order to signpost user's trustworthiness, we model trust with two components: i) Static Trust and ii) Dynamic Weight on Trust. Static Trust is captured by anti-anonymity process based on genealogical tree which will not be changed frequently. And Dynamic Weight on Trust is an algorithmic process to determine score based on predefined scoring scale that is applied on user's genealogical tree and community members. Evaluation of the above model on selected user group is quite positive in taking decision for users when (i) connecting with new friends (ii) self-representing in trustworthy manner. Our proposed trust model fully eliminates anonymity in social media networks which will be a trusted zone for users.},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-06-13},\n  date = {2016-12},\n  pages = {62-69},\n  keywords = {aghiles},\n  author = {Rahman, Mohammad Khaliqur and Adnan, Muhammad Abdullah},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/XRJD58R6/Rahman and Adnan - 2016 - Dynamic Weight on Static Trust for trustworthy soc.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213246,"version":0},"$loki":741},{"itemID":2204,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{gupta_proforma_2017,\n  title = {{{PROFORMA}}: {{Proactive Forensics}} with {{Message Analytics}}},\n  volume = {15},\n  shorttitle = {{{PROFORMA}}},\n  number = {6},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Security \\& Privacy},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Secur.

Reputation is often considered as a collective measure of trustworthiness based on the referrals or ratings from members in a community. Reputation systems have been applied in various applications such as online service provision. However, reputation models do not reflect user's quality of service (QoS) preferences and thus they might not be satisfied with the recommendations from others. In this paper, we propose a de-centralized reputation-based trust model that incorporates the user QoS preferences to select the best match Cloud Service Provider to process Big Data. Our trust model relies on three multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods including Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Weighted Product Method (WPM), and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). We conducted several experiments using simulated cloud environment to validate our trust model and assess the three MADM methods. The results show that the proposed model is pliable to users' requirements and efficiently evaluate trust of cloud providers.},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-06-13},\n  date = {2017-06},\n  pages = {266-273},\n  author = {Kassabi, Hadeel T.

However, controversial situations can easily arise from the subjectivity of trust opinions, when the lack of agreement leads to ambiguity and uncertainty in the inferred trust. In this work, we propose a novel trust inference algorithm, named TrustZic, which aims at improving the performance of trust inference in controversial conditions by combining local and global trust aspects. The proposed approach is based on the use of global reputation values as node weights biasing a local trust inference process.

In this paper, we propose a new trust inference method based on the implicit influence information available in the existing trust network. This approach uses the transitivity property of the trust for trust propagation and scale-free complex network property to limit the propagation length in the network. In this regard, we define a new terminology, degree of trustworthiness for a user, which adds the global influence in the inferred trust. This process improves the recommendation accuracy from the existing trustbased recommendation and neighborhood based collaborative filtering. Due to the availability of users preference from trust network which is absent in rating data, it also alleviates the very well-known cold start users problem of a recommender system.

The proposed method involves four rating prediction mechanisms: FM use the recommendation given by the most reliable recommender with the shortest trust propagation distance from the active user as the predicted rating, FMW weights the recommendation in FM, FA uses the mean value of recommendations with the shortest trust propagation distance from the active user as the predicted rating, and FAW weights recommendations in FA.

To address the two challenges, we identify an incremental approach to measuring users' influential degrees, detecting local and global influential nodes, and analyzing their evolution patterns, for which we propose three methods to partition time window. The three methods are the uniform time window, the non-uniform time window, and the uniform retweets number window, respectively. We apply our model on real data set in Sina weibo and conduct extensive analyses, from which we gain several interesting findings.

The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process `driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes (`actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes (`dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior.

As a result, redundant new metrics are proposed frequently, and privacy studies are often incomparable. In this survey we alleviate these problems by structuring the landscape of privacy metrics. For this we explain and discuss a selection of over eighty privacy metrics and introduce a categorization based on the aspect of privacy they measure, their required inputs, and the type of data that needs protection. In addition, we present a method on how to choose privacy metrics based on eight questions that help identify the right privacy metrics for a given scenario, and highlight topics where additional work on privacy metrics is needed.

This metric can be considered as an appropriate indicator for quantifying the security level of computer systems. We call the metric ``Mean Privacy'' and suggest a method for its quantification. It is quantified by using an information-theoretic model. For this purpose, we utilize a variant of attack tree that is able to systematically represent all feasible malicious attacks that are performed to violate the security of a system. The attack tree, as the underlying attack model, will be parameterized with some probability mass functions. The quantitative model will be used to express our intuition of the complexity of the attacks quantitatively. The usefulness of the proposed model lies in the context of security analysis. In fact, the analysis approach can be employed in some ways: Among several options for a system, we can indicate the most secure one using the metric as a comparative indicator. The security analysis of systems that operate under a variety of anticipated attack plans and different interaction environments can be carried out. Finally, new security policies, countermeasures and strategies can be applied to increase the security level of the systems.},\n  journaltitle = {Computer Communications},\n  shortjournal = {Computer Communications},\n  urldate = {2018-09-04},\n  date = {2014-10-01},\n  pages = {47-59},\n  keywords = {Privacy,Computer systems,Information theory,Quantification,Security},\n  author = {Almasizadeh, Jaafar and Abdollahi Azgomi, Mohammad},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/QVAEV76T/Almasizadeh_Abdollahi Azgomi_2014_Mean privacy.pdf},\n  note = {00012}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213570,"version":0},"$loki":766},{"itemID":2932,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{raad_privacy_2013,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Privacy in {{Online Social Networks}}},\n  abstract = {Online social networks have become an important part of the online activities on the web and one of the most influencing media.

In this article we survey different jamming attacks that may be employed against a sensor network. In order to cope with the problem of jamming, we discuss a two-phase strategy involving the diagnosis of the attack, followed by a suitable defense strategy. We highlight the challenges associated with detecting jamming. To cope with jamming, we propose two different but complementary approaches. One approach is to simply retreat from the interferer which may be accomplished by either spectral evasion (channel surfing) or spatial evasion (spatial retreats). The second approach aims to compete more actively with the interferer by adjusting resources, such as power levels and communication coding, to achieve communication in the presence of the jammer.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Network},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Netw.},\n  date = {2006-05},\n  pages = {41-47},\n  keywords = {Wireless sensor networks,access protocols,channel surfing,defense strategy,Energy conservation,jamming,Jamming,jamming sensor networks,MAC-layer protocols,Media Access Protocol,Packet switching,Power supplies,radio interference,Resumes,Signal generators,spatial evasion,spatial retreats,Switches,Wireless communication,wireless sensor networks},\n  author = {Xu, Wenyuan and Ma, Ke and Trappe, W. and Zhang, Yanyong},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/SYTFJXL4/Xu et al_2006_Jamming sensor networks.pdf},\n  note = {00559}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213682,"version":0},"$loki":773},{"itemID":2966,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{chiang_clarifying_2017,\n  title = {Clarifying {{Fog Computing}} and {{Networking}}: 10 {{Questions}} and {{Answers}}},\n  volume = {55},\n  issn = {0163-6804},\n  doi = {10.1109/MCOM.2017.7901470},\n  shorttitle = {Clarifying {{Fog Computing}} and {{Networking}}},\n  abstract = {Fog computing is an end-to-end horizontal architecture that distributes computing, storage, control, and networking functions closer to users along the cloud-to-thing continuum.

In that sense, there are several differences between fog and edge. First, fog is inclusive of cloud, core, metro, edge, clients, and things. The fog architecture will further enable pooling, orchestrating, managing, and securing the resources and functions distributed in the cloud, anywhere along the cloud-to-thing continuum, and on the things to support end-to-end services and applications. Second, fog seeks to realize a seamless continuum of computing services from the cloud to the things rather than treating the network edges as isolated computing platforms. Third, fog envisions a horizontal platform that will support the common fog computing functions for multiple industries and application domains, including but not limited to traditional telco services. Fourth, a dominant part of edge is mobile edge, whereas the fog computing architecture will be flexible enough to work over wireline as well as wireless networks.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Magazine},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

Specifically, we study how individuals' self-confidence levels evolve via a reflected appraisal mechanism. Motivated by the DeGroot-Friedkin model, we propose a Modified DeGroot-Friedkin model which allows individuals to update their self-confidence levels by only interacting with their neighbors and in particular, the modified model allows the update of self-confidence levels to take place in finite time without waiting for the opinion process to reach a consensus on any particular issue. We study properties of this Modified DeGroot-Friedkin model and compare the associated equilibria and stability with those of the original DeGroot-Friedkin model. Specifically, for the case when the interaction matrix is doubly stochastic, we show that for the modified model, the vector of individuals' self-confidence levels asymptotically converges to a unique nontrivial equilibrium which for each individual is equal to 1/n, where n is the number of individuals. This implies that eventually, individuals reach a democratic state.},\n  urldate = {2018-11-19},\n  date = {2015-03-13},\n  keywords = {Mathematics - Optimization and Control},\n  author = {Xu, Zhi and Liu, Ji and Basar, Tamer},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/WIJLSBWS/Xu et al. - 2015 - On a Modified DeGroot-Friedkin Model of Opinion Dy.pdf},\n  note = {00027}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213874,"version":0},"$loki":785},{"itemID":3081,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{bonchi_centrality_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Centrality {{Measures}} on {{Big Graphs}}: {{Exact}}, {{Approximated}}, and {{Distributed Algorithms}}},\n  pages = {200},\n  author = {Bonchi, Francesco and Morales, Gianmarco De Francisci and Riondato, Matteo},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/BR649M39/Bonchi et al. - Centrality Measures on Big Graphs Exact, Approxim.pdf},\n  note = {00012}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213884,"version":0},"$loki":786},{"itemID":3083,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{xing_weighted_2004,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Fredericton, NB, Canada}},\n  title = {Weighted {{PageRank}} Algorithm},\n  isbn = {978-0-7695-2096-4},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1344743/},\n  doi = {10.1109/DNSR.2004.1344743},\n  abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Web, users get easily lost in the rich hyper structure. Providing relevant information to the users to cater to their needs is the primary goal of website owners. Therefore, finding the content of the Web and retrieving the users' interests and needs from their behavior have become increasingly important. Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing the users' behavior, the content of the pages, and the order of the URLs that tend to be accessed in order. Web structure mining plays an important role in this approach. Two page ranking algorithms, HITS and PageRank, are commonly used in web structure mining. Both algorithms treat all links equally when distributing rank scores. Several algorithms have been developed to improve the performance of these methods. The Weighted PageRank algorithm (WPR), an extension to the standard PageRank algorithm, is introduced in this paper. WPR takes into account the importance of both the inlinks and the outlinks of the pages and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the pages. The results of our simulation studies show that WPR performs better than the conventional PageRank algorithm in terms of returning larger number of relevant pages to a given query.},\n  eventtitle = {Proceedings. {{Second Annual Conference}} on {{Communication Networks}} and {{Services Research}}, 2004.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings. {{Second Annual Conference}} on {{Communication Networks}} and {{Services Research}}, 2004.},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-11-19},\n  date = {2004},\n  pages = {305-314},\n  author = {Xing, W. and Ghorbani, A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/6Z3HFZHW/Xing and Ghorbani - 2004 - Weighted PageRank algorithm.pdf},\n  note = {00531}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213900,"version":0},"$loki":787},{"itemID":3087,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{colina_internet_,\n  title = {*{{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{IoT}}) in 5 Days},\n  pages = {175},\n  author = {Colina, Antonio Li\\~n\\'an and Vives, Alvaro and Bagula, Antoine and Zennaro, Marco and Pietrosemoli, Ermanno},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/SPXX2Q54/Colina et al. - Internet of Things (IoT) in 5 days.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138213934,"version":0},"$loki":789},{"itemID":3099,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@incollection{yin_modeling_2012,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Berlin, Heidelberg}},\n  title = {Modeling {{Group Emotion Based}} on {{Emotional Contagion}}},\n  volume = {385},\n  isbn = {978-3-642-32890-9 978-3-642-32891-6},\n  url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-32891-6_31},\n  abstract = {Using computer to generate crowd animation to understand the behavior choice and making decision of individuals in crowd has become a trend in several fields.

For the emotional contagion plays a significant role in the development of group emotion, we select personality, emotional expressivity and susceptibility as mainly factors which influence the intensity of group emotions.

This article is concerned with studying the time-asymptotic behaviour of the extended contact processes on static, undirected, finite-size networks. This is a contact process with nonzero exogenous infection rate (also known as the -susceptible-infectedsusceptible model). The only known analytical characterization of the equilibrium distribution of this process is for complete networks. For large networks with arbitrary topology, it is infeasible to numerically solve for the equilibrium distribution since it requires solving the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of a matrix that is exponential in N, the size of the network. We derive a condition on the infection rates under which, depending on the degree distribution of the network, the equilibrium distribution of extended contact processes on arbitrary, finite-size networks is well approximated by a closed-form formulation. We confirm the goodness of the approximation with small networks answering inference questions like the distribution of the percentage of infected individuals and the most-probable equilibrium configuration. We then use the approximation to analyse the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process on the 4941-node US Western power grid.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Complex Networks},\n  shortjournal = {J.

There are two limiting cases widely analyzed in the physics literature, the so-called contact process (CP) where the contagion is expanded at a certain rate from an infected vertex to one neighbor at a time, and the reactive process (RP) in which an infected individual effectively contacts all its neighbors to expand the epidemics. However, a more realistic scenario is obtained from the interpolation between these two cases, considering a certain number of stochastic contacts per unit time. Here we propose a discrete-time formulation of the problem of contact-based epidemic spreading. We resolve a family of models, parameterized by the number of stochastic contact trials per unit time, that range from the CP to the RP. In contrast to the common heterogeneous mean-field approach, we focus on the probability of infection of individual nodes. Using this formulation, we can construct the whole phase diagram of the different infection models and determine their critical properties.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {EPL (Europhysics Letters)},\n  shortjournal = {EPL Europhys.

The presence of numerous local spatial constraints makes the process and extent of epidemic spreading extremely difficult to predict.

This difficulty stems from the fact that packet scheduling decisions at each hop influences and are influenced by decisions on other hops and only a few provably efficient online scheduling algorithms exist in the multihop setting. We consider a general multihop wired network topology in which packets with various deadlines and weights arrive at and are destined to different nodes through given routes. We study the problem of joint admission control and packet scheduling in order to maximize the cumulative weights of the packets that reach their destinations within their deadlines. We first focus on uplink transmissions in the tree topology and show that the well known earliest deadline first algorithm achieves the same performance as the optimal off-line algorithm for any feasible arrival pattern. We then address the general topology with multiple source-destination pairs, develop a simple online algorithm and show that it is O(PM log PM )competitive where PM is the maximum route length among all packets. Our algorithm only requires information along the route of each packet and our result is valid for general arrival samples. Via numerical results, we show that our algorithm achieves performance that is comparable to the non-causal optimal offline algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a provable (based on a sample-path construction) competitive ratio, subject to hard deadline constraints for general network topologies.},\n  pages = {9},\n  author = {Mao, Zhoujia and Koksal, C Emre and Shroff, Ness B},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/54CHPJVR/Mao et al. - Online Packet Scheduling with Hard Deadlines in Wi.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138214282,"version":0},"$loki":808},{"itemID":3168,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{tohme_evolutionary_1999,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Tokyo, Japan}},\n  title = {Evolutionary {{Petri}} Net Approach to Periodic Job-Shop-Scheduling},\n  volume = {4},\n  isbn = {978-0-7803-5731-0},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/812444/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812444},\n  abstract = {In this paper, Periodic Job-Shop-Scheduling Problem (PJSSP) extended from Job-Shop-Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is considered.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Petri Nets}} 1989},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {1990},\n  pages = {1-29},\n  author = {Marsan, M.

As pedestrians' smartphones do not support the IEEE 802.11p amendment which is customized for vehicular networking, we have initiated an approach that utilizes cellular technologies. Study shows potential of utilizing 3G and LTE for highly mobile entities of vehicular network applications. In addition, some vehicles are already equipped with cellular connectivity but otherwise the driver's smartphone is used as an alternative. However, smartphone limited battery life is a bottleneck in realization of such pedestrian safety system. To tackle the energy limitation in smartphones, we employ an adaptive multi-level approach which operates in an energy-saving mode in risk-free situations but switches to normal mode as it detects a risky situation.

Our three primary contributions are: (1) We experimentally demonstrate that, on average, current protocols only achieve 50\\% of the overall throughput possible in this scenario. In particular, even with a streamlined connection setup procedure that does not use DHCP, high packet losses early in a vehicular connection are responsible for the loss of nearly 25\\% of overall throughput, 15\\% of the time. (2) We quantify the effects of ten problems caused by the mechanics of existing protocols that are responsible for this throughput loss; and (3) We recommend best practices for using vehicular opportunistic connections. Moreover, we show that overall throughput could be significantly improved if environmental information was made available to the 802.11 MAC and to TCP.

At the end of this paper, we use the data of Beijing UCAR Inc.'s car in a case study. This case demonstrates: For low sampling rate matching track points in the complex road, the algorithm has a good uptime, and an exact match was found.},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking},\n  shortjournal = {EURASIP J.

These systems are mainly based on camera, infrared and/or radar sensors and suffer from difficulties like road users hidden by cars and buildings. These collision prevention systems are mainly autonomous systems and are not cooperating with other detection systems. We propose to extend CALM, the communication standard for cooperative vehicular systems (16), with a local communication system for protection devices for vulnerable road users. These systems can be integrated into existing systems like bicycle navigation systems and/or smartphones. For devices which cannot rely on a navigation system we propose to use position estimation, based on the position of neighbouring devices, like parked cars, roadside units or smart devices.},\n  pages = {11},\n  author = {David, Carels and Wim, Vandenberghe and Ingrid, Moerman and Piet, Demeester},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/3NYPSVZ7/David et al. - ARCHITECTURE FOR VULNERABLE ROAD USER COLLISION PR.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138214744,"version":0},"$loki":832},{"itemID":3214,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{merdrignac_systeme_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Syst\\`eme Coop\\'eratif de Perception et de Communication Pour La Protection Des Usagers Vuln\\'erables},\n  pages = {253},\n  author = {Merdrignac, Pierre},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/J393YQJ3/Merdrignac - Système coopératif de perception et de communicati.pdf},\n  note = {00001}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138214750,"version":0},"$loki":833},{"itemID":3215,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{merdrignac_study_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Gran Canaria, Spain}},\n  title = {Study on {{Perception}} and {{Communication Systems}} for {{Safety}} of {{Vulnerable Road Users}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-6596-3},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7313396/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ITSC.2015.304},\n  abstract = {The existing R\\&D efforts for protecting vulnerable road users (VRU) are mainly based on perception techniques, which aim to detect VRUs utilizing vehicle embedded sensors. The efficiency of such a technique is largely affected by the sensor's visibility condition. Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication can also contribute to the VRU safety by allowing vehicles and pedestrians to exchange information. This solution is, however, largely affected by the reliability of the exchanged information, which most generally is the GPS data. Since perception and communication have complementary features, we can expect that a combination of such approaches can be a solution to the VRU safety. This is the motivation of the current work. We develop theoretical models to present the characteristics of perception and communications systems. Experimental studies are conducted to compare the performances of these techniques in real-world environments. Our results show that the perception system reliably detects pedestrians and other objects within 50 m of range in the line-of-sight (LOS) condition. In contrast, the V2P communication coverage is approximately 340 and 200 meters in LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) conditions, respectively. However, the communication-based system fails to correctly position the VRU w.r.t the vehicle, preventing the system from meeting the safety requirement. Finally, we propose a cooperative system that combines the outputs of the communication and perception systems.},\n  eventtitle = {2015 {{IEEE}} 18th {{International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}} - ({{ITSC}} 2015)},\n  booktitle = {2015 {{IEEE}} 18th {{International Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}}},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-09},\n  pages = {1876-1881},\n  author = {Merdrignac, Pierre and Shagdar, Oyunchimeg and Jemaa, Ines Ben and Nashashibi, Fawzi},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/WG7LDGYW/Merdrignac et al. - 2015 - Study on Perception and Communication Systems for .pdf},\n  note = {00014}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138214774,"version":0},"$loki":834},{"itemID":3218,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{wang_predictability_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Predictability of {{Road Traffic}} and {{Congestion}} in {{Urban Areas}}},\n  volume = {10},\n  issn = {1932-6203},\n  url = {https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121825},\n  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0121825},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {PLOS ONE},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2015-04-07},\n  pages = {e0121825},\n  author = {Wang, Jingyuan and Mao, Yu and Li, Jing and Xiong, Zhang and Wang, Wen-Xu},\n  editor = {Perc, Matjaz},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/A674TN2S/Wang et al. - 2015 - Predictability of Road Traffic and Congestion in U.pdf;/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/JY2XPYZ7/Wang et al. - 2015 - Predictability of Road Traffic and Congestion in U.pdf;/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/Z9VPW6UF/Wang et al. - 2015 - Predictability of Road Traffic and Congestion in U.pdf},\n  note = {00027}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138214788,"version":0},"$loki":835},{"itemID":3219,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{marfia_safe_2013,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Safe {{Driving}} in {{LA}}: {{Report}} from the {{Greatest Intervehicular Accident Detection Test Ever}}},\n  volume = {62},\n  issn = {0018-9545, 1939-9359},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6339125/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TVT.2012.2226484},\n  shorttitle = {Safe {{Driving}} in {{LA}}},\n  abstract = {The UN Economic Commission's Statistics of Road Traffic Accidents report of 2011 shows that every year, about 150 000 human beings lose their lives on the roads of the western world.

Ideally, if such technologies were put into place, vehicles could be part of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) capable of spreading relevant information about dangerous events (e.g., car accidents) to all approaching drivers. However, all this is mainly supported by simulation studies, as no practical results have been published to date, revealing the effective performances of such systems at work. In this paper, we fill this gap, presenting a detailed description of the greatest experiments (a few thousand throughout the streets of Los Angeles), to date, ever performed with an accident warning system specifically devised for highway scenarios. In particular, among all the possible candidate schemes, we ran a few thousand experiments with the accident warning system algorithm that was proven to be optimal in terms of bandwidth usage and covered distance in realistic scenarios. Our experiments confirm what has been observed before in theory and simulation, i.e., the use of such a system can reduce, by as much as 40\\%, the amount of vehicles involved in highway pileups.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Traditional Kalman filter-based INS/GPS integration schemes have several inadequacies related to sensor error model and immunity to noise. Alternatively, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks with three layers have been implemented to improve the position accuracy of the integrated system. However, MLP neural networks show poor accuracy for low-cost INS because of the large inherent sensor errors. For the first time the paper demonstrates the use of knowledge-based source difference artificial neural network (SDANN) to improve navigation performance of low-cost sensor, with or without external aiding sources. Unlike the conventional MLP or artificial neural networks (ANN), the structure of SDANN consists of two MLP neural networks called the coarse model and the difference model. The coarse model learns the input\\textendash{}output data relationship whereas the difference model adds knowledge to the system and fine-tunes the coarse model output by learning the associated training or estimation error. Our proposed SDANN model illustrated a significant improvement in navigation accuracy of up to 81\\% over conventional MLP. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDANN method is effective for GPS/INS integration schemes using low-cost inertial sensors, with and without GPS.},\n  number = {10},\n  journaltitle = {Measurement Science and Technology},\n  shortjournal = {Meas.

Three PID control parameters, i.e., the proportional gain Kp, integral gain Ki and derivative gain Kd are required to form a parameter vector which is considered as a particle of PSO. To derive the optimal PID parameters for the Ar.Drone, the modified update method is employed to move the positions of all particles in the population.

UAVs embed more and more sensor technology, and their small mounted cameras allow for efficient mapping of large areas in short time. Yet, civil missions such as rescue operations would need a timely delivery of high-resolution images, which calls for high-speed communication such as provided by WLAN IEEE 802.11n. Driven by extensive experiments, the key finding of this contribution is that 802.11n performs poorly in highly mobile and aerial scenarios, as the throughput between UAVs drops far below the theoretical maximum as soon as they become airborne. This is partially caused by the limitations of the embedded hardware, but also a result of the network dynamics of the aerial links. In order to dissect the origins of the low performance figures, we isolate the potential causes of degradation by analyzing our data of throughput, packet loss, aircraft and antenna orientation, and cruise speed. We discuss quantitatively how practical it is to deliver high-resolution images when being exposed to aerial throughput. We believe that it will be a long way until micro UAVs transferring large-size data become reality and argue for a new amendment of IEEE 802.11 addressing the communication among highly-mobile UAVs.},\n  eventtitle = {The 8th {{ACM}} International Workshop},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 8th {{ACM}} International Workshop on {{Wireless}} Network Testbeds, Experimental Evaluation \\& Characterization - {{WiNTECH}} '13},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2013},\n  pages = {25},\n  author = {Asadpour, Mahdi and Giustiniano, Domenico and Hummel, Karin Anna},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/XPSRA3NT/Asadpour et al. - 2013 - From ground to aerial communication dissecting WL.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138214966,"version":0},"$loki":850},{"itemID":3260,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{fernandezllorca_autonomous_2011,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Autonomous {{Pedestrian Collision Avoidance Using}} a {{Fuzzy Steering Controller}}},\n  volume = {12},\n  issn = {1524-9050, 1558-0016},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5715879/},\n  doi = {10.1109/TITS.2010.2091272},\n  abstract = {Collision avoidance is one of the most difficult and challenging automatic driving operations in the domain of intelligent vehicles. In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers' behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to define the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed field tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Unfortunately, GPS data is still plagued with errors that frequently produce inaccurate trajectories. Research in map matching algorithms focuses on how to efficiently match GPS tracking data to the underlying road network. This article presents an innovative map matching algorithm that considers the trajectory of the data rather than merely the current position as in the typical map matching case. Instead of computing the precise angle which is traditionally used, a discrete eightdirection chain code, to represent a trend of movement, is used. Coupled with distance information, map matching decisions are made by comparing the differences between trajectories representing the road segments and GPS tracking data chain-codes. Moreover, to contrast the performance of the chain-code algorithm, two evaluation strategies, linear and non-linear, are analyzed. The presented chain-code map matching algorithm was evaluated for wheelchair navigation using university campus sidewalk data. The evaluation results indicate that the algorithm is efficient in terms of accuracy and computational time.},\n  number = {2},\n  journaltitle = {Transactions in GIS},\n  shortjournal = {Trans.

Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT.

Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network.

A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security.

The advantages of this approach include: avoiding the need for a real vehicle, allowing to easily generate realistic vehicle parameter patterns, and supporting emulated GPS functionality. We evaluate our platform by conducting a performance analysis in terms of OBD-II response times and channel capacity when relying on a Bluetooth adapter.

These applications can be grouped into three types, namely, road safety, traffic efficiency, and infotainment, each with its own set of functional and performance requirements. In pursuance of assisting drivers to travel safely and comfortably, several of these requirements have to be met simultaneously. While the coexistence of multiple radio access technologies brings immense opportunities towards meeting most of the vehicular networking application requirements, it is equally important and challenging to identify the strength and weaknesses of each technology and understand which technology is more suitable for the given networking scenario. In this paper, we evaluate two of the most viable communication standards, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11p and long-term evolution (LTE) by 3rd Generation Partnership Project for vehicular networking. A detailed performance evaluation study of the standards is given for a variety of parameter settings such as beacon transmission frequency, vehicle density, and vehicle average speed. Both standards are compared in terms of delay, reliability, scalability, and mobility support in the context of various application requirements. Furthermore, through extensive simulation-based study, we validated the effectiveness of both standards to handle different application requirements and share insight for further research directions. The results indicate that IEEE 802.11p offers acceptable performance for sparse network topologies with limited mobility support. On the other hand, LTE meets most of the application requirements in terms of reliability, scalability, and mobility support; however, it is challenging to obtain stringent delay requirements in the presence of higher cellular network traffic load.},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking},\n  shortjournal = {EURASIP J.

Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model.

We propose a suite of methods and techniques to be applied from traffic data acquisition, preprocessing, transformation and integration until data advanced processing and transfer. Next, we detail some techniques for data preprocessing and integration, or fusion, phases. Even though the comprehensive use of historical traffic data and assignment models to support the most part of online services and operations, real-time data is extremely important to promote models' accuracy and, therefore, the reliability of information and outputs derived from data fusion and processing. Together with techniques and theoretical formulas we present a case study applied to the Portuguese Brisa's A5 motorway, a 25 km inter-urban highway between Lisbon and Cascais. Traffic on this motorway heading to Lisbon in the morning rush hours typically experiences high levels of congestion. Brisa, the motorway operator company, has equipped A5 with a variety of traffic sensors to be used in a real-time multi-purpose way, either for traffic management and control or for traveler information and third-part applications.},\n  eventtitle = {2010 13th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}} - ({{ITSC}} 2010)},\n  booktitle = {13th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}}},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2010-09},\n  pages = {216-223},\n  author = {Lopes, J. and Bento, J. and Huang, E. and Antoniou, C. and Ben-Akiva, M.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/FWP7R8TC/Lopes et al. - 2010 - Traffic and mobility data collection for real-time.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138215338,"version":0},"$loki":876},{"itemID":3349,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{takahashi_urban_2012,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Anchorage, AK, USA}},\n  title = {Urban Road User Classification Framework Using Local Feature Descriptors and {{HMM}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-3063-3 978-1-4673-3064-0 978-1-4673-3062-6},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6338669/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338669},\n  abstract = {Surveillance and safety systems for pedestrians and bicyclists are becoming much more important because there continue to be a large number of traffic accidents that involve vulnerable road users.

The framework consists of two classification meth$\\-$ ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip$\\-$ tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experiments for pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification are con$\\-$ ducted independently and both methods achieve nearly 90\\% on classification.},\n  eventtitle = {2012 15th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}} - ({{ITSC}} 2012)},\n  booktitle = {2012 15th {{International IEEE Conference}} on {{Intelligent Transportation Systems}}},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2012-09},\n  pages = {67-72},\n  author = {Takahashi, Toshimitsu and Kim, HyungKwan and Kamijo, Shunsuke},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/M5JU9NJ4/Takahashi et al. - 2012 - Urban road user classification framework using loc.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138215360,"version":0},"$loki":877},{"itemID":3365,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{neto_comparison_2008,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Comparison between Detailed Model Simulation and Artificial Neural Network for Forecasting Building Energy Consumption},\n  volume = {40},\n  issn = {03787788},\n  url = {http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378778808001448},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.enbuild.2008.06.013},\n  abstract = {There are several ways to attempt to model a building and its heat gains from external sources as well as internal ones in order to evaluate a proper operation, audit retrofit actions, and forecast energy consumption.

In the real world, the situation is different and most continuously collected data streams are generated by dynamic processes, which may change over time, in some cases even drastically. The change in the underlying concept, also known as concept drift, causes the data-mining model generated from past examples to become less accurate and relevant for classifying the current data. Most online learning algorithms deal with concept drift by generating a new model every time a concept drift is detected. On one hand, this solution ensures accurate and relevant models at all times, thus implying an increase in the classification accuracy. On the other hand, this approach suffers from a major drawback, which is the high computational cost of generating new models. The problem is getting worse when a concept drift is detected more frequently and, hence, a compromise in terms of computational effort and accuracy is needed. This work describes a series of incremental algorithms that are shown empirically to produce more accurate classification models than the batch algorithms in the presence of a concept drift while being computationally cheaper than existing incremental methods. The proposed incremental algorithms are based on an advanced decision-tree learning methodology called ``Info-Fuzzy Network'' (IFN), which is capable to induce compact and accurate classification models. The algorithms are evaluated on real-world streams of traffic and intrusion-detection data.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {Applied Soft Computing},\n  shortjournal = {Appl.

Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation.

This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Trans.

Cars have no power constraints and they can be instrumented with high end computational units and graphic devices. The deployment at scale of urban vehicular systems, however, requires a careful design able to consider challenges across several domains. Vehicular systems are arguably a prominent example of cyber-physical systems. The development of such systems requires a truly multidisciplinary approach and a close integration between the application, communication, and physical domains. Hardware and software mounted on vehicles will face a harsh physical and communication environment that will greatly affect all the system components. In this paper we report on the challenges and opportunities for multimedia vehicular urban sensing systems based on our field experiences in Macao (China) and Los Angels (USA). We designed and built the components for a pollution monitoring system able to support closed-loop optimization between pollution and traffic management. Our initial set of prototype vehicles are now running in the city of Macao and they are measuring the air parameters as well as the urban traffic. The paper aims at exposing some of the issues encountered, outlining the problems of a city wide deployment, and augmenting our in-field experience with the results from large scale simulation studies.},\n  number = {8},\n  journaltitle = {Signal Processing: Image Communication},\n  shortjournal = {Signal Process.

There are not many studies that compare the performance of processing a modest amount of structured data in a NoSQL database with a traditional relational database. In this paper, we compare one of the NoSQL solutions, MongoDB, to the standard SQL relational database, SQL Server. We compare the performance, in terms of runtime, of these two databases for a modest-sized structured database.

Realtime traffic information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and traffic control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current traffic conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a flow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle traffic over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efficacy in controlling the traffic as the number of vehicles increases.},\n  eventtitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}} ({{IMIS}})},\n  booktitle = {2011 {{Fifth International Conference}} on {{Innovative Mobile}} and {{Internet Services}} in {{Ubiquitous Computing}}},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2011-06},\n  pages = {450-455},\n  author = {Kim, Wooseong and Gerla, Mario},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/U28YNY9U/Kim and Gerla - 2011 - NAVOPT Navigator Assisted Vehicular Route OPTimiz.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138215556,"version":0},"$loki":892},{"itemID":3397,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{gerla_picsonwheels_2013,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{San Diego, CA}},\n  title = {Pics-on-Wheels: {{Photo}} Surveillance in the Vehicular Cloud},\n  isbn = {978-1-4673-5288-8 978-1-4673-5287-1 978-1-4673-5286-4},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6504250/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504250},\n  shorttitle = {Pics-on-Wheels},\n  abstract = {Cloud computing allows user to access remote hardware, data and software through the network.

Underlying the formation of norms is the ubiquitous belief that there is a correct response for every situation and an abiding interest for persons to base their responses on these correct foundations. Given such a belief, a normative evaluation of a feeling, thought or action is likely to arise when persons perceive that their positive or negative attitudinal evaluation is shared by one or more influential others. If interpersonal agreements validate attitudes and transform attitudes into norms, then the development of a theory of norm formation may draw on extant ``combinatorial'' theories of consensus production that describe how shared attitudes are produced and maintained in groups. The network theory of social influence that I employ is one such combinatorial approach. An important sociological implication of this network theory is that the content of norms must be consistent with the social stratification (or more general pattern of inequality) of interpersonal influences in a group. I illustrate the theory with an analysis of Roethlisberger and Dickson's (1939) classic observations on the Bank Wiring Observation Room.},\n  number = {3},\n  journaltitle = {Social Networks},\n  shortjournal = {Social Networks},\n  urldate = {2018-12-20},\n  date = {2001-07-01},\n  pages = {167-189},\n  keywords = {“Combinatorial” theories,Anderson’s weighted averaging model,Bank Wiring Observation Room},\n  author = {Friedkin, Noah E.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/KMWGKMAD/Friedkin_2001_Norm formation in social influence networks.pdf;/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/BNPZHC4M/S0378873301000363.html},\n  note = {00223}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138215676,"version":0},"$loki":900},{"itemID":3420,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{ren_survey_2015,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A Survey of Recommendation Techniques Based on Offline Data Processing: {{A SURVEY OF RECOMMENDATION TECHNIQUES BASED ON OFFLINE DATA PROCESSING}}},\n  volume = {27},\n  issn = {15320626},\n  url = {http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cpe.3370},\n  doi = {10.1002/cpe.3370},\n  shorttitle = {A Survey of Recommendation Techniques Based on Offline Data Processing},\n  number = {15},\n  journaltitle = {Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience},\n  shortjournal = {Concurr.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-18},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {17-24},\n  author = {Jones, Tyler and Dali, Aniket and Rao, Manoj Ramesh and Biradar, Neha and Madassery, Jean and Liu, Kaikai},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/LPZF5AGW/Jones et al. - 2018 - Towards a Layered and Secure Internet-of-Things Te.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138215752,"version":0},"$loki":905},{"itemID":3438,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{selimi_blockchainenabled_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Munich, Germany}},\n  title = {Towards {{Blockchain}}-Enabled {{Wireless Mesh Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-5838-5},\n  url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3211933.3211936},\n  doi = {10.1145/3211933.3211936},\n  eventtitle = {The 1st {{Workshop}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 1st {{Workshop}} on {{Cryptocurrencies}} and {{Blockchains}} for {{Distributed Systems}}  - {{CryBlock}}'18},\n  publisher = {{ACM Press}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {13-18},\n  author = {Selimi, Mennan and Kabbinale, Aniruddh Rao and Ali, Anwaar and Navarro, Leandro and Sathiaseelan, Arjuna},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/ERIYLWB5/Selimi et al_2018_Towards Blockchain-enabled Wireless Mesh Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00008}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138215764,"version":0},"$loki":906},{"itemID":3441,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kabbinale_blockchain_2018,\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprinttype = {arxiv},\n  eprint = {1811.04078},\n  primaryClass = {cs},\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Blockchain for {{Economically Sustainable Wireless Mesh Networks}}},\n  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04078},\n  abstract = {Decentralization, in the form mesh networking and blockchain, two promising technologies, is coming to the telecommunications industry.

However, there are some problems with the growth of the blockchain. The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction. This has the disadvantage that the system doesn't operate without compensation. Also, the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Algorithm using private blockchain has a limited number of acceptable malicious users.

Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus).

In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage).

This work verifies the feasibility of sensing air pollution from social networks and of integrating such information with real sensors feeds, unveiling how people advertise such phenomenon, acting themselves as smart objects, and how online posts relate to true pollution levels. This work explores a new dimension in pollution sensing for the benefit of environmental and transportation research in future smart cities, confronting over 1,500,000 posts and pollution readings obtained from governmental on-the-field sensors over a one-year span.},\n  number = {4},\n  journaltitle = {Mobile Networks and Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Mob.

The low-level control system, which acts over the DTPN representation, optimizes the performances of the traffic system, by solving a mathematical programming problem which minimizes the number of vehicles in the system.

IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities.

Although many related ideas have been proposed, there are very few literatures with theoretical and data support. This paper focuses on the research of model construction and performance evaluation. First, an IoT security model is established based on blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). In this model, many security risks of traditional IoT architectures can be avoided, and system performance is significantly improved in distributed large capacity storage, concurrency and query. Secondly, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated through the average latency and throughput, which are meaningful for further research and optimization of this direction.

That is why, IoT is presently spanning over a diverse range of applications in the fields of education, healthcare, agriculture, military, industry, etc. The resources IoT requires in those applications are heterogeneous in nature, for example, storage, processor, network, sensor nodes, energy, etc. The obvious challenge is how to manage these limited resources efficiently. Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed. The paper considers with such a future direction of research in this field.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  shortjournal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},\n  urldate = {2019-03-07},\n  date = {2018-10-15},\n  pages = {42-60},\n  keywords = {IoT,Heterogeneous resources,Resource management,Scheduling,Simulation tools},\n  author = {Chowdhury, Abishi and Raut, Shital A.},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/8678UQHT/Chowdhury_Raut_2018_A survey study on Internet of Things resource management.pdf;/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/ITPNSDBC/S1084804518302315.html},\n  note = {00002}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138216394,"version":0},"$loki":944},{"itemID":3637,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{qin_software_2014,\n  location = {{Krakow, Poland}},\n  title = {A {{Software Defined Networking}} Architecture for the {{Internet}}-of-{{Things}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-4799-0913-1},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6838365/},\n  doi = {10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838365},\n  eventtitle = {{{NOMS}} 2014 - 2014 {{IEEE}}/{{IFIP Network Operations}} and {{Management Symposium}}},\n  booktitle = {2014 {{IEEE Network Operations}} and {{Management Symposium}} ({{NOMS}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-03-07},\n  date = {2014-05},\n  pages = {1-9},\n  author = {Qin, Zhijing and Denker, Grit and Giannelli, Carlo and Bellavista, Paolo and Venkatasubramanian, Nalini},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/Q3E3LYAK/Qin et al_2014_A Software Defined Networking architecture for the Internet-of-Things.pdf;/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res/storage/U4DYXP7E/Qin et al. - 2014 - A Software Defined Networking architecture for the.pdf},\n  note = {00250}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1552138216408,"version":0},"$loki":945},{"itemID":3640,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{kouicem_internet_2018,\n  title = {Internet of Things Security: {{A}} Top-down Survey},\n  volume = {141},\n  issn = {1389-1286},\n  url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128618301208},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.comnet.2018.03.012},\n  shorttitle = {Internet of Things Security},\n  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the promising technologies that has attracted a lot of attention in both industrial and academic fields these years.

However, as new emergent technology, IoT suffers from several security issues which are most challenging than those from other fields regarding its complex environment and resources-constrained IoT devices. A lot of researches have been initiated in order to provide efficient security solutions in IoT, particularly to address resources constraints and scalability issues. Furthermore, some technologies related to networking and cryptocurrency fields such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain are revolutionizing the world of the Internet of Things thanks to their efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive top down survey of the most recent proposed security and privacy solutions in IoT.
