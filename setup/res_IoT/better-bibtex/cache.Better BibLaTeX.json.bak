For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

The big data transmitted to the cloud or fog will consume massive network bandwidth. This may result in the IoT network easily encountering network congestion. Moreover, there are IoT applications that need to transfer multimedia data with multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements. A state-of-the-art, MINA, intends to meet multiple QoS requirements of IoT applications; however, it is unable to guarantee QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and it is also unable to adapt to the current network status. To conquer the above problems, we propose an application-aware QoS routing algorithm (AQRA) for SDN-based IoT networking to guarantee multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications and to adapt to the current network status for better routing paths. Evaluation results have shown that, the AQRA has better fitness ratios of QoS requirements compared to MINA while multiple QoS requirements of high-priority IoT applications are guaranteed. The AQRA improves the average end-to-end flow performance by 10.75\\%, 11.88\\% and 10.82\\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively. The AQRA improves the standard deviation of end-to-end flow performance by 14.37\\%, 17.95\\% and 14.28\\% compared to MINA in terms of delay, jitter and packet loss rate, respectively.

While it is obvious that any instrument for the measurement of time operates according to a discrete time scale, due to its finite precision, and that most interesting modern systems, being digital in nature, intrinsicallyuse a discrete time scale, models often use a continuous time scale. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the greater simplicity of continuous time models. Indeed, if the time axis is discrete, the model has to consider the fact that multiple events may occur between two consecutive time marks, and explore the effect of all possible combinations among these events. In the continuous time scale, instead, using appropriate probabilistic assumptions, it is possible to univocally order events, so that it is always possible to take into consideration only one event at a time.},\n  booktitle = {Advances in {{Petri Nets}} 1989},\n  publisher = {{Springer Berlin Heidelberg}},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {1990},\n  pages = {1-29},\n  author = {Marsan, M.

In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is explored to improve the segment identification accuracy of map-matching algorithms. The proposed ANN is continuously trained by using the horizontal shift imposed on GPS points and once it is trained, it will be used to correct raw GPS points before inputting them into the map-matching algorithm.

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},\n  number = {1},\n  journaltitle = {IEEE Communications Surveys \\& Tutorials},\n  shortjournal = {IEEE Commun.

Vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby creating a highly dynamic and heterogeneously managed ad-hoc network. It is these network properties that make it a challenging task to protect integrity of the data and guarantee its correctness. A major component is the problem that traditional security mechanisms like PKI-based asymmetric cryptography only exclude outsider attackers that do not possess key material. However, because attackers can be insiders within the network (i.e., possess valid key material), this approach cannot detect all possible attacks. In this survey, we present misbehavior detection mechanisms that can detect such insider attacks based on attacker behavior and information analysis. In contrast to well-known intrusion detection for classical IT systems, these misbehavior detection mechanisms analyze information semantics to detect attacks, which aligns better with highly application-tailored communication protocols foreseen for cITS. In our survey, we provide an extensive introduction to the cITS ecosystem and discuss shortcomings of PKI-based security. We derive and discuss a classification for misbehavior detection mechanisms, provide an in-depth overview of seminal papers on the topic, and highlight open issues and possible future research trends.},\n  urldate = {2018-12-18},\n  date = {2016-10-21},\n  author = {family=Heijden, given=Rens W., prefix=van der, useprefix=true and Dietzel, Stefan and Leinm\\\"uller, Tim and Kargl, Frank},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res_IoT/storage/W67H3GPW/van der Heijden et al_2016_Survey on Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1553728183724,"version":0},"$loki":294},{"itemID":3295,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{hashemi_critical_2014,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {A Critical Review of Real-Time Map-Matching Algorithms: {{Current}} Issues and Future Directions},\n  volume = {48},\n  issn = {01989715},\n  url = {https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0198971514000908},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.07.009},\n  shorttitle = {A Critical Review of Real-Time Map-Matching Algorithms},\n  abstract = {Current navigation systems/services allow drivers to keep track of their precise whereabouts and provide optimal routes to reach specified locations.

Four prediction models for the learning algorithms are applied and used with neural network solutions: back-propagation, Cascade-forward back-propagation, adaptive filter and extended Kalman filter, to estimate which model can be recommended. The noise simulation and bridge's short-period GPS of the monitoring displacement component of one Hz sampling frequency are used to validate the four models and the previous method. The results show that the Adaptive neural networks filter is suggested for de-noising the observations, specifically for the GPS displacement components of structures.

Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to non-safety applications such as entertainment, optimal speed advisory and/or congestion/accident information. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim at the betterment of the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where protocols performed well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. With the advent of cloud computing paradigm, offloading local resources to a shared pool of resources has been an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and on the pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures.

As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{IEEE International Congress}} on {{Internet}} of {{Things}} ({{ICIOT}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-18},\n  date = {2018-07},\n  pages = {17-24},\n  author = {Jones, Tyler and Dali, Aniket and Rao, Manoj Ramesh and Biradar, Neha and Madassery, Jean and Liu, Kaikai},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res_IoT/storage/LPZF5AGW/Jones et al_2018_Towards a Layered and Secure Internet-of-Things Testbed via Hybrid Mesh.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1553728184474,"version":0},"$loki":338},{"itemID":3448,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{jeon_rmbc_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Chiang Mai, Thailand}},\n  title = {{{RMBC}}: {{Randomized}} Mesh Blockchain Using {{DBFT}} Consensus Algorithm},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-2290-2},\n  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8343211/},\n  doi = {10.1109/ICOIN.2018.8343211},\n  shorttitle = {{{RMBC}}},\n  abstract = {The blockchain is decentralized network system that verifies the validity of the transaction through the consensus of the verifiers without trusted third parties. This mechanism ensures transaction integrity disclosing transaction information transparently. Therefore, it is emerging as the core technology of the 4th industrial revolution by improving reliability and efficiency with features of decentralization, ensuring the integrity, and economic cost reduction. However, there are some problems with the growth of the blockchain. The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction. This has the disadvantage that the system doesn't operate without compensation. Also, the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Algorithm using private blockchain has a limited number of acceptable malicious users. In this case, if the users collude with malicious and exceed the limited number, the transaction is rejected. In this paper, we propose a Smart Manager System and RMBC-DBFT (Randomized Mesh Blockchain Diversity of opinion BFT) enables the safe transaction to the problems above.},\n  eventtitle = {2018 {{International Conference}} on {{Information Networking}} ({{ICOIN}})},\n  booktitle = {2018 {{International Conference}} on {{Information Networking}} ({{ICOIN}})},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  urldate = {2019-01-19},\n  date = {2018-01},\n  pages = {712-717},\n  author = {Jeon, Sol and Doh, Inshil and Chae, Kijoon},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res_IoT/storage/VSXB6YH7/Jeon et al_2018_RMBC.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1553728184510,"version":0},"$loki":340},{"itemID":3449,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@inproceedings{lundell_routing_2018b,\n  langid = {english},\n  location = {{Chania, Greece}},\n  title = {A {{Routing Protocol}} for {{LoRA Mesh Networks}}},\n  isbn = {978-1-5386-4725-7},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449743/},\n  doi = {10.1109/WoWMoM.2018.8449743},\n  abstract = {A limitation of current LoRa networks is their single-hop nature.

To facilitate these applications, we present a new routing protocol to enable mesh networking with LoRa, allowing for multihop networking between gateways to extend coverage. Our protocol is tailored specifically to the requirements of LoRa networks.

The server estimates tag coordinates using multi-dimensional scaling and a novel corrective transformation based on tag clustering. We designed a low-cost tag for RSSI measurement and an energy efficient solution for managing a mesh of 1000 tags on one site using time division multiplexing. The tags are fully controlled and synchronized by the server. To stay synchronized for several hours until a next downlink the tags estimate and compensate the real-time clock error. Large-scale tests are yet to be performed, but lab-based and small-scale tests in real conditions show a maximal error of 8 meters and a battery lifetime of 5 years.},\n  date = {2018},\n  pages = {6},\n  author = {Gotthard, Petr and Jankech, Tom\\'a{\\v s}},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res_IoT/storage/RK9YLZGT/Gotthard_Jankech_2018_Low-Cost Car Park Localization Using RSSI in Supervised LoRa Mesh Networks.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1553728184564,"version":0},"$loki":343},{"itemID":3474,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{_wireless_,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Wireless {{Mesh Network}} - a Well Proven Alternative to {{LPWAN}}},\n  pages = {26},\n  file = {/home/aghiles/These/Redaction/setup/res_IoT/storage/M6IMJSP4/Wireless Mesh Network - a well proven alternative to LPWAN.pdf},\n  note = {00000}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1553728184692,"version":0},"$loki":348},{"itemID":3476,"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":false,"DOIandURL":"both","asciiBibLaTeX":true,"asciiBibTeX":true,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":true,"bibtexParticleNoOp":false,"bibtexURL":"url","reference":"@article{archana_survey_2018,\n  langid = {english},\n  title = {Survey on {{Energy Efficient}} and {{Throughput Enhancement Routing Protocols}} over {{Wireless Mesh Networks}}},\n  volume = {6},\n  issn = {23219653},\n  url = {http://ijraset.com/fileserve.php?FID=12903},\n  doi = {10.22214/ijraset.2018.1163},\n  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of Energy efficient routing protocols that are intended to improve the throughput performance over Wireless Mesh Networks.

The problem consists in the selection of the most suitable from all radio access technologies available. The decision process is called network selection, and depends on several parameters, such as quality of service, mobility, cost, energy, battery life, etc. Several methods and approaches have been proposed in this context, with their objective being to offer the best QoS to the users, and/or to maximize re-usability of the networks.

Furthermore, the game theory concept is illustrated, the use of the fuzzy logic is presented, and the utility functions defining the network selection process are discussed.},\n  journaltitle = {Journal of Telecommunications and Information Technology},\n  shortjournal = {J.
