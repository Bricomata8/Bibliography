Abstract

Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the promising technologies that has attracted a lot of attention in both industrial and academic fields these years. It aims to integrate seamlessly both physical and digital worlds in one single ecosystem that makes up a new intelligent era of Internet. This technology offers a huge business value for organizations and provides opportunities for many existing applications such as energy, healthcare and other sectors. However, as new emergent technology, IoT suffers from several security issues which are most challenging than those from other fields regarding its complex environment and resources-constrained IoT devices. A lot of researches have been initiated in order to provide efficient security solutions in IoT, particularly to address resources constraints and scalability issues. Furthermore, some technologies related to networking and cryptocurrency fields such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain are revolutionizing the world of the Internet of Things thanks to their efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive top down survey of the most recent proposed security and privacy solutions in IoT. We discuss particularly the benefits that new approaches such as blockchain and Software Defined Networking can bring to the security and the privacy in IoT in terms of flexibility and scalability. Finally, we give a general classification of existing solutions and comparison based on important parameters.
