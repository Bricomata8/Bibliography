History

What is IoT
• Kevin Ashton (British entrepreneur) coined the term IoT in 1999. He was referring to a global network of radiofrequency identification (RFID) connected objects.

IoT definition

IoT definition
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a scenario in which objects, animals or people transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

IoT definition
The term "Internet of Things" has come to describe a number of technologies and research disciplines that enable the Internet to reach out into the real world of physical objects.

What is IoT
• The IoT is more than connecting things to the internet, it’s about bridging the physical and digital worlds to create value for people

Internet Data Things

New value for people: Capabilities Services Experiences Business models …

What is IoT
Internet + Things + Data

Things
These nodes are highly constrained in terms of Physical size CPU power Memory (few tens of kilobytes) Bandwidth (Maximum of 250 KB/s, lower rates the norm)
Power consumption is critical, if battery powered then energy efficiency is paramount.

What is IoT ?
Internet + Things + Data

Technologies: 5G

Device-to-Device
Two or more devices which directly connect and communicate.
They are not dependent on intermediary application servers and can communicate via numerous different networks.
Exemplified in applications such as home automation systems (light bulbs/ light switches/thermostats/door locks, etc.)
Interoperability issues appear due to built-in security/trust mechanisms and device-specific data models.
Wireless Network

Light Bulb From Manufacturer A

Bluetooth, Z-Wave Zigbee

Light Bulb From Manufacturer B

Device-to-Cloud
Device connects directly to Internet cloud service, such as an application service provider, to exchange data and control message traffic.
Utilizes existing communication mechanisms such as Ethernet or WiFi to establish connection with IP network and devices.
Employed by devices such as Nest Labs Thermostat & Samsung Smart TV. Interoperability issues appear when integrating devices by different manufacturers.
Proprietary data protocols may tie devices to specific cloud services (vendor lockin).

Device-to-Gateway
Device connects through a gateway as a conduit to access a cloud service.

Intermediary between cloud service and device; provides security and protocol translation.

Device-to-Gateway model’s primary feature is the ability to overcome proprietary device restrictions in connecting devices.

Adds complexity and costs to overall system.

Back-end Data Sharing
Communication architecture that allows users to analyze and export smart object data from a cloud service in combination with data from other sources.

Grants access to uploaded 3rd party sensor data.

Extension of single device-to-cloud communication model.

Allows users to relocate/share data when switching between IoT services.

What does that mean in size?
Not gigabytes
Most likely not a few terabytes
Possibly not 10’s of terabytes
Probably 100’s of terabytes
Definitely petabytes

IoT and privacy

IoT and privacy
Privacy rights and expectations are critical to ensuring Internet trust.
Everyone has different personal privacy expectations and ability to trust the Internet.
Unknown 3rd party information/data sharing and analyzing exhibited (e.g. social media).
Traditional “notice & consent” online privacy model; devices frequently have no user interface to configure privacy preferences.
