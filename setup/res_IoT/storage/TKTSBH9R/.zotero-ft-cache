Key industry trends

Microservices
An approach to develop a single application as a suite of small services, each running
in its own process and communicating with
lightweight mechanisms
✓ Innovate more rapidly and be more agile
6

Containers
A technology to give each application running on a server its own, isolated environment
to run. It holds the components necessary to run the desired
software. ✓ Speed up the testing
process and build large, scalable cloud applications

Autom. ation
“Infrastructure as code” approach to enable the entire infrastructure deployment to be
expressed and controlled through software
✓ Reduce complexity and offer a more responsive IT environment;

Operator ambitions

◼ Need to increase network flexibility while reducing CAPEX and OPEX ◼ All these approaches are eminently suitable to be used in NFV environments ◼ NFV should be equally agile and automated

But making NF cloud-native won’t be so easy!

Why?

Because they have unique properties

Telco-Grade features and orchestration challenges

◼ Multi-network conncectivity: telco workloads may require sophisticated network models to support multi-homing with various QoS ◼ Service function chaining: telco applications must be configured together as a service through which traffic needs to be correctly steered
◼ Specific scheduling policies: new placement constraints need to be supported ➔ Network-related, inter-component affinity/anti-affinity, energy, etc.
◼ Deterministic performances: some telco workloads are performances sensitive and hence need predictable access to CPU and memory
◼ Accelerated data plane: some telco workloads require native network performances to achieve very low latency and jitter

Telco PaaS
21 Interne Orange

NGPaaS project overview
◼ 5G PPP phase 2 IA project ◼ Aiming at building a next generation PaaS for 5G ◼ 12 partners consortium:
- 6 Large companies: Nokia Bell-Labs France (coordinator),
Nokia Israël, Orange, ATOS (SP), BT, ONAPP(UK, technical manager)
- 2 start-ups: VOSYS (FR, innovation manager),
VM2M (FR)
- 4 research laboratories: BCOM, DTU (DK), IMEC (BE), UNIMIB (IT)
◼ 24-month project, start: June 2017, End : June 2019
22

NGPaaS targeted properties
◼ PaaS framework
- Modular components (re-use of Superfluidity component model) - Enable to build customized PaaS according to use cases by combination and
extension of the framework components
◼ Telco-grade
◼ IT/5G convergent
◼ Multi-sided
- Vendor PaaS + Operator PaaS + Vertical PaaS
◼ Heterogenicity
- Address both VM, containers, Unikernel and any new techno to come
23◼ New OSS/BSS model

NGPaaS objective: a Telco-grade Kubernetes for an enhanced orchestration of cloud native VNFs

◼ Scope
- Design, develop and deploy a Kubernetes based system for an automated management
and orchestration of cloud-native container-based network functions
◼ Objectives
- Customize Kubernetes to close the gap with regard to NFV requirements - A prototype of a telco grade Kubernetes with a first deployed use case
