Introduction
• The reasons of the slow commercial take off of WSNs
• WSNs are characterized by different requirements depending on the specific application and deployment scenario
• Make WSNs programmable
• Tightly related to the operating system, requiring the application developers to focus on intensive low-level details rather than on the application logic.

Introduction (cont.)

• SDN and OpenFlow have been recently proposed to solve analogous issues in the wired domain

• [4], [5] are the works extend the SDN concepts to WSNs and W-PANs, but still have some shortcoming
• Protocol details
• No performance evaluations

• This paper overcome the above problems and

define a stateful SDN solution for WSNs called SDN-

Introduction
• SDN-WISE introduces a software layer, allows several virtual networks to run on the same physical wireless sensor or WPAN network
• Make sensor nodes programmable as finite state machines
• Reduce the signaling between nodes and Controller
• SDN-WISE provides tools for running a real Controller in an OMNeT++ simulated network
4

Related Work
• Differently from traditional OpenFlow, Sensor OpenFlow supports in-network packet processing and various types of addressing defined for WSNs [4]
• Compared to Sensor OpenFlow, SDWN offers a more flexible specification of the rules to classify packets, i.e., flow matching can consider any part of the packet, and supports the use of duty cycle to achieve energy efficiency in WSNs [5]
5

SDN-WISE Overview
• WSNs are characterized by low capabilities in terms of memory, processing, and energy availability
• Requirements different from wired networks
• Energy efficient - SDN-WISE support duty cycle and data aggregation
• SDN-WISE nodes can handle packets based on the content stored in their header and payload
• Packet classification can be done based more complex relational operators such as higher than and different from.
6

SDN-WISE Approach
• 3 data structures
• The WISE States Array • The Accepted IDs Array • The WISE Flow Table
• Matching Rules • Best next hop towards the sink

Performance Metrics
• Round Trip Time (RTT)
• the time interval between the generation of a data packet and the acknowledgment
• Efficiency
• the ratio between the number of payload bytes received by the destinations and the overall number of bytes circulating in the network
• Controller response time
• the duration from the Controller receives a request to send the corresponding entry
16

Result - RTT
• CDF of RTT in different payload • RTT increases as the distance and the payload
increase
17

Result - Efficiency
• The efficiency vs. the payload size for different values of the interval between consecutive transmissions of the TD packets, T
Most of the inefficiency is due to the high ratio between the header size and the payload size 18

Result – Controller Response Time
• Simulate the process of request generation by the nodes modeling a network consisting of 50, 60, and 70 nodes
19

Conclusion
• SDN-WISE is stateful and aimed at reducing the amount of information exchanged between sensors and SDN controllers
• Details on the SDN-WISE protocol stack are provided as well as results obtained from extensive measures in a physical testbed
20

Future Work
• Make the SDN-WISE network resilient to intentional attacks and bugs in the Controller software
• Network coding in SDN-WISE
