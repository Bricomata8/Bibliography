ABSTRACT
Nowadays, the impact of global warming is causing societies to become more aware and responsive to environmental problems. As a result, pollution sensing is gaining more relevance. In order to have a strict control over air quality, the use of mobile sensors is becoming a promising alternative to traditional air quality stations. Mobile sensors allow to easily perform measurements in many diﬀerent places, thereby oﬀering substantial improvements in terms of the spatial granularity of the data gathered. Pollution monitoring near large industrial areas or in rural areas where transportation facilities are poor or inexistent can complicate the mobile sensing approach. To address this problem, in this paper we propose endowing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with pollution sensors, allowing them to become autonomous air monitoring stations. The proposed solution has the potential to quickly cover a target region at a low cost, and providing great ﬂexibility.

1. INTRODUCTION
The growing inﬂuence of pollution in our lives has caused environmental organizations and governmental institutions to prioritize the monitoring of environmental pollutants. To this aim, the European Topic Center on Air Pollution and Climate Change Mitigation (ETC/ACM [1]) brings together 14 European organizations for the analysis and monitoring of climate change. Similarly, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA [2]) is responsible for tracking the evolution of environmental pollution in the United States. These agencies typically rely on a few professional air quality stations deployed throughout the countries; however, the results provided have a low spatial resolution, being only representative on a limited area near those stations.
Recently, diﬀerent proposals have attempted to improve the spatial resolution of air quality measurements. Authors such as Adam et al. [3] have used statistical techniques to analyze ozone levels in the city of Quebec. Cheng et al. [7] relied on crowdsensing to propose a system to monitor the concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns) Other authors have instead relied on mobile sensors. For instance, Liu et al. [16] have relied on mobility to analyze ozone levels in the city of Toronto. Other projects like [6] measured the environmental pollution in the city of Belgrade, Serbia, by relying on Waspmote sensors installed in the public transport system. Finally, Hu et al. [12] relied on a vehicular ad-hoc network to monitor diﬀerent environmental parameters.
The techniques adopted by the aforementioned authors are mostly applicable to urban areas, where diﬀerent mobility alternatives are available. However, in rural areas mobility options are quite more limited. In addition, air quality monitoring is also relevant not only for the people living in

these areas, but also because it directly aﬀects crops, animals and insects. For example, McFrederick et al. [17] showed how air pollution undermines the essential process of pollination by interfering with the ability of bees and other insects to follow the scent of ﬂowers to their source. Thus, diﬀerent solutions for measuring air quality should be sought for such environments.
Our project proposes the use of UAVs, speciﬁcally of the multicopter type, as an eﬃcient solution for quickly and easily monitoring air quality in any region where ground mobility is a poor option. To meet the proposed goal, we plan mounting a computing unit endowed with pollution sensors on the UAV to create a ﬂying air quality station. Our solution allows programming the UAV by deﬁning the target region to monitor using a smartphone. The UAV then ﬂies autonomously throughout the target area and returns with the desired data. Again using a smartphone, data is retrieved from the UAV and uploaded to a server for storage and analysis.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section we refer to some related works addressing UAV-based sensing. An overview of the proposed solution and methodology is presented in section 3. Section 4 offers some implementation details by describing the hardware used. Finally, in section 5, we present our conclusions along with some guidelines for future work.
2. RELATED WORKS
UAV-based solutions have experienced a very substancial increase in the last decade, especially in the past ﬁve years. Back in 2004, NASA experts deﬁned a wide set of civil applications for UAVs [9], highlighting their potential in the near future in areas such as commercial, Earth Sciences, national security, and land management. This preliminary report was ratiﬁed years later by authors such as Hugenholtz et al. [13], who explained how the use of UAVs can revolutionize research methods in the ﬁelds of Earth Sciences and remote sensing.
If we focus on the speciﬁc area of quadrotor multicopters, authors like Gupte et al. [11] and Colomina y Molina [8] consider that, given their high maneuverability, compactness and ease of use, diﬀerent applications for these devices are being found in areas such as civil engineering, search and rescue, emergency response, national security, military surveillance, border patrol and surveillance, as well as in other areas such as Earth Sciences, where they can be used to study climate change, glacier dynamics, volcanic activity, or for atmospheric sampling, among others.
In our case, we are more interested in atmospheric sampling to measure air pollution levels. In this research area, Anderson and Gaston [4] highlight the applicability of UAVs in the ﬁeld of ecology, emphasizing that the spatial and temporal resolutions of the data obtained by traditional methods often do not adapt well to the requirements of local ecological research. Furthermore, the use of UAVs, when ﬂying at low altitudes and speeds, oﬀer new opportunities in terms of ecological phenomena measurements enabling the delivery of data with a ﬁner spatial resolution. In fact, authors such as Zhang and Kovacs [19] explain how the images taken by small UAVs are becoming an alternative to high resolution satellite images, which are much more expensive, to study the variations in crop and soil conditions. Speciﬁcally, the use of UAVs is considered a good alternative given its low

cost of operation in environmental monitoring, its high spatial and temporal resolution, and its high ﬂexibility in the scheduling of image acquisitions. A good example of this use can be found in the work of Bellvert et al. [5], which shows how, by using a multicopter equipped with a thermal camera, it has been possible to obtain a very precise map of water levels in a vineyard, thereby achieving signiﬁcant advances in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.
Regarding the use of UAVs to measure air pollutants, most eﬀorts focused on measuring ozone leves. However, previous works mainly focused on troposphere measurements, and not on land levels where ozone has a negative impact on health. One of the few works on land-level ozone measurements is [14] were an UAV equipped with ozone sensors is able to cover a wide area in an automated manner. Although the authors seek to make land measurements, this approach diﬀers from ours due to the use of a large-sized aircraft that cannot ﬂy at low altitudes, and therefore the values obtained are not as representative in terms of impact on human health. In addition, the associated costs and operational requirements far exceed those of the proposed solution.
Overall, previous studies clearly show that, so far, eﬀorts in terms of sensing platforms have focused mainly on large sized UAVs such as planes or gliders. Our project diﬀers from others by seeking a multicopter-based sensing platform that is open, low cost, with minimum operational requirements, capable of integrating diﬀerent types of sensors (including ozone), with a secure and versatile communications systems, and connected to the cloud for online data analysis. Thus it may be used by businesses or users with much more limited resources compared to previous cases, where its use was typically limited to government entities.
3. METHODOLOGY AND PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE
To achieve the desired solution, the proposed methodology consists of: (i) clearly deﬁning the design requirements of the target solution; (ii) proposing a high-level overview of the global system architecture; (iii) deﬁning the desired information ﬂow in the scope of the proposed architecture; and (iv) developing an initial prototype meeting all previous requirements and conditions.
3.1 Design requirements
Req. 1: Open multicopter design.
Regarding the multicopter design, we seek an open platform that is easily scalable and reusable by other researchers, and whose cost is reduced. To achieve this objective, the diﬀerent components used to manufacture the multicopter should be standard components easily found in the market, and that are consistent with the ”open-source” philosophy. This will allow any researcher the modiﬁcation or replacement of any multicopter component without a negative impact on the overall performance of the device. To achieve this goal the following strategy is proposed: (i) Basic multicopter components such as the frame, engines, propellers, electronic speed controllers (ESC) and batteries shall be chosen among models available in the market, easily accessible, and avoiding expensive elements. (ii) The ﬂight controller should be open to possible modiﬁcations, and have a serial

communications interface following a well-known protocol. (iii) An element oﬀering high-accuracy GPS and compass is required for navigation, and it should be fully compatible with the ﬂight controller. These elements are particularly important to allow the controller to know the location, speed and altitude of the device at any time, and also to ﬂy to predeﬁned positions autonomously. (iv) The remote control used should be universal to allow adapting it to any type of multicopter, programmable to associate diﬀerent functions to each of the controls dynamically, while integrating aspects such as telemetry on the same radio frequency link.
Req. 2: Integration of an embedded system to provide intelligence to the multicopter.
In order to perform additional tasks not related to ﬂight and navigation, the existing multicopter hardware should be extended through an embedded, low-power device that is able to operate as a fully-featured computer in practical terms. Preferably, it should support the Linux operating system along with all associated tools to provide a platform that is well known and widely used by the open source research community. This embedded system should be linked to the ﬂight controller to manage ﬂights.
Req. 3: Integration of a complete communications system.
The communications system of an UAV is especially critical considering that any failure can cause losing the control of the device, usually resulting in it being crashed or become lost. For this reason, the communications systems adopted should be resilient against attacks, and so its design should target security and robustness. To allow the UAV being controlled by mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, it should act as a wireless access point, creating a secure wireless network to which these mobile devices can connect to in order to control the UAV remotely. This network will be complemented by the UAV’s native communications system, including remote control and wireless telemetry.
Req. 4: Integration of pollution monitoring sensors.
The multicopter should include diﬀerent types of sensors including temperature, humidity, and diﬀerent pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, among others. These sensors should preferably be connected to the embedded system available in the multicopter.
Req. 5: Cloud-based storage, processing and display of data.
The data collected by the UAV should be retrieved by a mobile terminal and uploaded to the cloud, where they will be stored along with temporal and geographical information. The server is responsible for data processing tasks such as performing linear unbiased estimations, statistical processes commonly referred to as ordinary Kriging, and cartographic visualization of the data through color maps. This will allow, for example, studying the pollutant levels in a given area at diﬀerent times, on diﬀerent days, and at diﬀerent altitudes.
3.2 Proposed architecture
To meet the requirements deﬁned in the previous section, we propose the architecture shown in Figure 1, which has seven physical elements: (i) an open source multicopter (UAV), (ii) an embedded system based on Raspberry Pi

Figure 1: Architecture overview.
[10], (iii) a GrovePi sensor board [15], (iv) several low-end air pollution sensors, (v) a Android-based device (tablet or smartphone), (vi) a Cloud-based system, and (vii) a remote control.
The multicopter (UAV) is deployed with open source and oﬀ-the-shelf devices including a Flame Wheel 450 (F450) frame, a Pixhawk 3DR ﬂight controller, and SunnySky X221213 motors, among others. By using open standards, it is possible to manage the multicopter using the Raspberry Pi, thereby providing another way for ﬂight guidance.
The Raspberry Pi is the central architectural element in our system. It is mounted directly on the UAV, and connects via WiFi to any Android device while also retrieving pollution information through sensors located in the attached GrovePi Board. Internally, it has three software components: (i) the UAV Guidance component to conﬁgure the planned route on the UAV and receive telemetry data, (ii) the Sensor Manager to read pollution data from GrovePi sensors, and (iii) a Communication Manager to handle the wireless communications with the Android-based device and send/receive information,.
The Grove Sensor Board (GrovePi) connects directly to the Raspberry Pi GPIO header allowing to add diﬀerent types of sensors easily through the Grove connector. It has several ports and oﬀers libraries to manage them.
Low-End Sensors are connected to the Grove Sensor Board through Grove connectors, and they can monitor diﬀerent air pollutants, e.g. CO, CO2, Ozone, PM10, PM2.5, Air quality, and so forth. They are small, light and cheap.
The Android-based device can be a smartphone or a tablet, and allows users manage the system in a secure manner. It has four software components: (i) the Graphical Interface to conﬁgure the UAV’s route and manage sensor readings, (ii) the Communications Manager to control the wireless communications via Raspberry Pi, (iii) the UAV Guidance to autonomously manage the UAV’s ﬂight, and (iv) the Sensor Manager to manage sensor data received from the GrovePi that are then sent to a Cloud server.
The Cloud-based application processes the collected data with advanced statistics techniques, like Kriging or Cokriging [18], and oﬀers several types of services related to air pollution.
The remote control acts as control backup system. It allows to avoid crashes if the conﬁgured route fails, and the

UAV is out of control.
3.3 Expected information ﬂow
Figure 2 illustrates the expected information ﬂow of the proposed prototype.
To start monitoring a particular area, the UAV route should be introduced through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the Android-based application (step 1). The user deﬁnes diﬀerent route points, speed, and active sensors. Once the Android device receives the route parameters, it sends all entered settings to the Raspberry Pi (step 2) using the Connection Manager module (via WiFi). The Raspberry Pi then conﬁgures the UAV with the received guidance parameters through the UAV Guidance module (step 3).
During the ﬂight, the Raspberry Pi receives telemetry information from the UAV again through the UAV Guidance module (step 4.a), and sensor data from the diﬀerent sensors via the Sensor Manager module, which in turn relies on the Board Sensor API (step 4.b), storing all received information for future diﬀusion. If at any time during the ﬂight manual intervention is required, the remote control helps to recover the control over the UAV.
When the UAV returns to the origin, all the collected information is sent to the Android device (step 5) using the Connection Manager module (via WiFi connection). Then, when the smart device has Internet connectivity, either WiFi or Cellular, it sends the collected information to the Cloudbased server via the Sensor Manager module (step 6).
Finally, an application running on the cloud analyses the information and oﬀers a detailed report concerning air pollution levels in the target area.
4. PROJECT DETAILS
Currently the project is on an intermediate development stage.
Regarding the hardware development, it involves the construction of an Open Source UAV, embedding a Raspberry Pi on the UAV, coupling air pollution sensors on the Raspberry Pi, and providing a wireless interface to connect to any Android system. Figure 3 shows the current status of our hardware prototype, showing a fully operational UAV in ad-

dition to other elements. The embedding of the Raspberry Pi on the multicopter is pending since it requires creating some parts on a 3D printer and providing a link to the Pixhawk 3DR ﬂight controller. Grove elements, like GrovePi and Grove sensors, are used as an interface between analog air pollution sensors and the Raspberry Pi, and are already operative.
Concerning software components, they are developed on the Raspberry Pi, the Android system, and the Cloud-based application, thereby connecting all hardware components. The Raspberry Pi is the center of our system since it acts as a gateway between the UAV, the sensors, and the Android device. Sensor measurement software was developed in Python and relies on available GrovePi libraries, being also fully operational. Communications with Android devices are also operative, being ﬂight guidance software the only pending element.
The Android system is used mainly as a graphical user interface and a gateway to the Internet; its development is still in an initial stage.
Concerning the cloud-based application, it is fully operational, storing environment pollution levels and analyzing their distribution. It was developed in PHP and runs on an Apache server.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Performing air quality measurements with a high spatial granularity remains nowadays a challenge due to the complexity and costs involved. In this paper we propose equipping UAVs with pollution sensors to create a low-cost mobile air monitoring station that is especially useful in environments with poor ground accessibility. The envisioned architecture oﬀers simpliﬁed management tasks and cloud-based data storage and analysis. As future work we will complete our prototype based on the proposed design and perform test ﬂights to validate our solution.
