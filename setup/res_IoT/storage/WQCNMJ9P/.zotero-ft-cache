6LoWPAN – general characteristics

• New standard protocol dedicated for Internet of Things
• IPv6 : each node can be directly addressed, end2end IP communication (sensor2server)
• IPv6 header compression for efficiency, managed by a border router
• Rely on IEEE 802.15.4 as a transmission layer (same as Zigbee, WirelessHART,..) • Open source implementation
• Supports mesh networks (sensors can relay communication)
• Standard routing protocols (RPL, LoadNG) customizable for energy optimisation vs. mobility support, e.g. taking into account energy levels of sensors in case of energy harvesting
• Supported by IoT Operating Systems (Contiki, TinyOS, FreeRTOS)
• Contiki modern OS for smart nodes, RAM: 2~35KB, Flash: 5~40KB, multithreading: protothread
• Powerful simulation tools (Cooja)

LPWAN – General characteristics
• Low Power
• 6LoWPAN < Bluetooth LE << LPWAN << GPRS/3G/4G • Simplified protocol (% 4G) -> less overhead, less CPU
• Wide Area
• Range from few kms to a couple of dozen kms • Suitable to deploy at low cost a regional or national network • Better Indoor transmission performance than 3G/4G (to be discussed)
• Simple protocol
• Low bandwidth (100 bps -> few dozen of kbps) • Use of ISM bands in Europe (868 MHz) • Short messages (-> 242 octets), not suitable for high volume • Basic addressing (p2p), no routing, session,.. • Basic security (usually AES128)

LPWAN: the contenders
• Sigfox
• Very limited, dedicated to data capture : • Uplink: 100bps, 12 bytes/msg, max 140 msg/day • Downlink: 8 bytes/msg, max 4 msg/day • Focused on low cost & scalabity • Proprietary, 1 license per country
• LoRa(WAN)
• 3 classes of devices (asynchronous, synchronous, continuous) • (a little bit) more versatile than Sigfox • Standardized by LoRa Alliance, local networks and multiple licences allowed
• Narrowband IoT
• New standard proposed by 3GPP, standardisation body of GSM, 3G, 4G
• Only usable by existing owners of licenced bands!
• Main advantage: 3G/4G base stations are HW compliant (only SW upgrade) • More complex and more expensive (energy) at node side

Conclusion
• LPWAN networks allow direct connectivity between sensors and Cloud through public networks
• Without gateways and usage of other private/public networks
• But with limitations regarding throughput and messaging (use case)
• 6LoWPAN provide end2end IP connectivity between sensors and Cloud in a very efficient way (energy, routing, mobility)
• But requires a gateway through Internet (IPv4 or IPv6)
• CETIC investigates new solutions for Wireless sensor networks and participates in the definition of 6LoWPAN (Border router, tests)
