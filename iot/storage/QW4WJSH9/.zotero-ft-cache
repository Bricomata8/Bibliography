Proposed Solution

TOWARDS A NEW FRAMEWORK

• A methodology based on MDE
- high level graphical models to specify - implementation obtained by code generation
• Define a Metamodel
- model description with separation of concern - generic and extendable
• Multi-facet approach - domain-specific modeling language (DSML)
- Focus on a subset of the metamodel to reduce complexity - External tools seen as external facets - Automatic Gateway/link between facets provided (M2M)
