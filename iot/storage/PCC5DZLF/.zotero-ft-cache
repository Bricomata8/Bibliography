1. Data Science: definition

• Data science
• The science of making sense of data • The use of data management, statistics and
machine learning, visualization to collect, clean, integrate, process, analyze and visualize big data
• Goal: create data products and data services
• "Data is the new oil of the digital economy" (Wired, 2014)
• Data scientist
• Not to be confused with data analyst • Strong technical skills • AND good knowledge of the business domain

Chapter 1 - 6

Big Data: what is it?

• A buzz word!

• It depends on your perspective
• E.g. 10 terabytes is big for an OLTP system, but small for a web search engine
• A definition (Wikipedia)

• Consists of data sets that grow so large that they become awkward to work with

• But size is only one dimension of the problem

• Dimensions (Vs): volume, velocity, variety, veracity, validity

• How big is big?

• Moving target: terabyte (1012 bytes), petabyte (1015 bytes), exabyte (1018), zetabyte (1021)

• Landmarks in DBMS products

• 1980: Teradata database machine

• 2010: Oracle Exadata database machine

Chapter 1 - 7

Why Big Data Today?

• Overwhelming amounts of data
• Exponential growth, generated by all kinds of programs, networks and devices
• E.g. Web 2.0 (social networks, etc.), mobile devices, computer simulations, satellites, radiotelescopes, sensors, etc.
• Increasing storage capacity
• Storage capacity has doubled every 3 years since 1980 with prices steadily going down
• 1 Gigabyte (HDD): $400K in 1980, $10K in 1990, $1K in 1995, $10 in 2000, $0.01 in 2018
• Very useful in a digital world!
• Massive data => high-value information and knowledge

Chapter 1 - 8

Big Data Dimensions: the five V’s

• Volume
• Refers to massive amounts of data • Makes it hard to store and manage, but also to analyze
• Velocity
• Continuous data streams are being captured (e.g. from sensors, mobile devices, IoT) and produced
• Makes it hard to perform online processing
• Variety
• Different data formats, different semantics, uncertain data • Makes it hard to integrate and analyze
• Veracity
• Authenticity and conformity of the data with reality • Altered by bias, noise, misinformation, fake news
• Validity
• Correction and accuracy of data for the intended use

Chapter 1 - 9

Big Data Analytics (BDA)

• Objective: find useful information and discover knowledge in data
• Predictive analysis, decision support, research, …
• Why is this hard?
• Low information density (unlike in corporate data)
• Like searching for needles in a haystack
• External data from various sources
• Hard to verify and assess, hard to integrate
• Different kinds of data
• Structured data: transaction, decision-support, scientific
• Unstructured: web document, social network, open data, IoT
• Hard to integrate

Chapter 1 - 10

Some BDA Killer Apps

• 360° view of customers
• Marketing, recommendation
• Requires combining corporate (structured) data with external (unstructured) data (web, social networks, phone recordings, …)
• Online fraud detection across massive databases
• E-commerce, banking, telephony, etc.
• National security
• Signal intelligence, cyber analytics
• Medical science
• Personalized medicine, with major investment from the GAFAM

Chapter 1 - 14

IoT

• Interconnection of all kinds of digital objects via the Internet
• Sensors, smart meters, connected watches, etc.
• In general, excludes smartphones, tablets and PCs

• An object must have the following

capabilities :

• Identification (IP address)

• Data transfer (SMTP, http, …)

• Wireless communication (Wifi, Bluetooth, RFID,

…) Big Data School, IMSP 2019

Chapter 1 - 15

IoT

• Wide range of applications

• Transport, logistics, health, home automation, intelligent city, quantified self

• Exponential growth in the number of objects

• 50 billion by 2020 (according to Cisco) versus some billion for smartphones, tablets and PCs

• Many data processing services (big data)

• GAFAM, network operators

• Major issues

• Security and privacy protection • Scalability • Real-time processing

• Objective
• Strengthening the rights of persons whose data are processed
• Right to forget, reinforced consent, easy access,...
• Accountability of data controllers
• Principles
• Obligation to ensure that the processing operation complies with the rules laid down
• Involves data traceability at all stages of its life cycle

Impact on Big Data

• Advantages
• Obligation to ensure that the processing is in conformity with big data
• Progress in relation to the Data Protection Act of 6 January 1978 based on the principle of formality prior to collection
• Building trust with users
• Argument taken up by Apple, Cisco and Microsoft for a GDPR in the USA
• Drawbacks
• Additional cost and complexity for companies
• Limits of anonymization
• Big data processing on anonymous data can lead to the identification of persons via quasi-identifiers, such as place of residence, occupation, gender and age

• Privacy
• Personal data may be misused by data scientists or other users, and may violate the law
• Cost
• Data collection, aggregation, storage, analysis, and reporting • Support of security and privacy
• Incorrect analyses
• Models too simple or false (see "when big data goes bad") • Misinterpretation of the reasons represented by the data and
erroneous conclusions
• Bad data
• Many projects start off wrong, collecting all kinds of useless, outdated or erroneous data
