1.  Preparation

•  Without preparation, too many big data projects fail
•  Objectives too vague or too ambitious •  Expectations too high, even unrealistic •  Exceeding budget and deadlines •  Inability to evolve over the long term
•  A crucial step
•  Set clear and precise objectives, in order to demonstrate the value of the project to business users
•  Define indicators to measure the success of the project •  Look for the right tools to increase development
productivity

Choosing the Project
•  A tactical project, for a need and a service
•  Can then be adapted for other services
•  Characteristics of the project
•  Demonstrate its value to the business service •  Support at the highest level and sharing of the vision •  Value easily transferable within the company to other
departments
•  E.g. moving from marketing to logistics
•  Acquisition of transferable skills and lessons

2. Strategy

•  Definition of business objectives
•  Specific, e.g. reduce monthly customer loss by 20% •  Duration to achieve it, e.g. 3 to 6 months
•  Definition of IT objectives
•  In support of business objectives, e.g. setting up a customer data integration process
•  Duration and measure of success, e. g. 90% prediction rate of customer loss
•  Definition of data requirements
•  Identify the necessary data, internally (e.g. dormant data in silos) and externally
•  Characterize the data
•  Volume, variety, velocity, veracity
•  Compliance with standards: security, privacy,...

Team

•  Complementarity between understanding business objectives and technical aspects
•  Technical skills
•  Properly identify the need for new skills (e.g. Hadoop) and the integration of new recruits
•  Use the skills for which employees have been hired to avoid demotivation or departure
•  Anticipate the evolution of skills •  Be careful not to want to code everything in Java in
Hadoop
•  Beware of the NIH (not invented here) of the GAFAM

Tools
•  Understand and master the tools
•  Data analysis •  Machine learning •  Visualization •  Storage in files or databases •  Cluster management •  Integration, ETL, data lake •  Etc.
•  Properly assess their maturity (POC)
•  Many bugs in new products

3. Data Governance

•  When?
•  The big data project is company-wide (involves several divisions or departments)
•  To move from POC to industrialization
•  Why?
•  Develop the business (data quality) •  Saving and rationalizing •  Increase agility and productivity •  Comply with the law (e.g. GDPR)
•  How?
•  Data Governance Committee, responsible for overseeing the company's data policy
•  In connection with data stewards

Processus
•  Implementation of efficient, reusable and scalable processes for the following steps
•  Data access (streaming, extraction,...) •  Integration of various data •  Cleaning (duplicate removal, error correction,...) •  Data control (consolidation, enrichment,...) •  Securing (e. g. masking sensitive data) •  Data analysis •  Business requirements analysis •  Use of information

4. Architecture
•  Start small with a sandbox
•  Well controlled environment, e.g. Spark/Hadoop on a server
•  Plan for scale-up, e.g. distribution on n servers •  Hide test data from production •  Correct coding errors
•  Switch to the target architecture
•  E.g. data lake with data ingestion process and data delivery to applications

5. Best Practices
•  Start with clear, measurable objectives •  Have the support of the business •  Ensure that data is accessible •  Build a team with business and big data skills
•  Hire data scientists versus train BI experts
•  Establish governance •  Start small •  Seeing far away
•  Plan for scaling up in volume and load
