Solution issued from A2Nets projects
A2Nets project:
• Type: ITEA2 • From: 2011 to 2014 • Partners:
• Finland: VTT,Polar,Vipsolas,Tracker,Planray • France: LAAS-CNRS, Thales Communications, CEA, Gemalto, eDevice, Bull, Université Paris XII • Spain: AGGRUPPA, Mirakonta, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Tecnalia-ESI, Rucker Lypsa
SA, ATOS Origin • Turkey: Innova, Vector,C2Tech, Bizitek
• Main objective:
• Assist transition from M2M fragmented vertical markets to interoperable horizontal markets.
• One outcome (among many):
• Don’t introduce a new framework for interoperability. Extend or contribute to existing framework.
• Example: ETSI M2M standard

OTA software update solution requirements
The solution needed to be:
• OTA • Scalable => Multicast • Reliable and robust (support radio channel variations,
interferences, failures,…) • Energy efficient (updating software should not drain sensor
batteries) • Compatible with OMA DM (as part of ETSI M2M ).

MPL protocol
MPL (Multicast Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks):
• IETF draft (ROLL group), RFC soon. • Typically above 6LoWPAN. • Dissemination of IPv6 datagram through WSN. • Different from RPL multicast (which is not dissemination
oriented). • Based on “tickle timers” defined in RFC 6206. • Well adapted to OTA firmware update
•  see MPL simulator

Implementation
Implementation:
• Based on Contiki OS • Provides 6LoWPAN stack • Provides MPL (version 2.4, 3.x)
• Hardware: Zolertia Z1 sensor platforms. • Exploits Contiki’s “module” capabilities.
• Fine grained software update, at module level. • Small update files => better energy eefficiency. • Provide CRC mechanism to check correct recovery of modules, and to report success or failure to the gateway. • Possibility to interface with OMA DM Gateway.
• => 2 minutes video, if time allows.
