The definition of trust is a measure of confidence that an entity will work in an expected way from the perspective of trustor[7].
Mayer et al.[8] define the trust with factors as integrity,
	benevolence,
	and ability.
Integrity means honesty of peer participated in trust relationship,
	benevolence means the willingness of cooperation between peers in trust relationship,
	and ability implies the capacity for fulfilling requested action between peers in trust relationship.
