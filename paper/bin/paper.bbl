      \field{abstract}{Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments demand long-range wireless communications, especially in urban and metropolitan areas. LoRa is one of the most promising technologies in this context due to its simplicity and flexibility. Indeed, deploying LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios must achieve two main goals: efficient communications among a large number of devices and resilience against dynamic channel conditions due to demanding environmental settings (e.g., the presence of many buildings). This work investigates adaptive mechanisms to configure the communication parameters of LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios. To this end, we develop FLoRa, an open-source framework for end-to-end LoRa simulations in OMNeT++. We then implement and evaluate the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism built into LoRa to dynamically manage link parameters for scalable and efficient network operations. Extensive simulations show that ADR is effective in increasing the network delivery ratio under stable channel conditions, while keeping the energy consumption low. Our results also show that the performance of ADR is severely affected by a highly-varying wireless channel. We thereby propose an improved version of the original ADR mechanism to cope with variable channel conditions. Our proposed solution significantly increases both the reliability and the energy efficiency of communications over a noisy channel, almost irrespective of the network size. Finally, we show that the delivery ratio of very dense networks can be further improved by using a network-aware approach, wherein the link parameters are configured based on the global knowledge of the network.}

      \field{abstract}{LoRaWAN is emerging as an attractive network infrastructure for ultra low power Internet of Thing devices. Albeit the technology itself is quite mature and specified, how to effectively allocate wireless resources so as to support a large amount of devices in a same terrestrial area is an open challenge. This paper contributes by proposing two algorithms (of incremental complexity) which are shown to outperform the basic Adaptive Rate Strategy (ADR) so far considered. A first approach, named EXPLoRa-SF, shows the benefits of a simple strategy which does not limit to use (as per ADR) distance/RSSI measurements, but also selects Spreading Factors (SF) based on the total number of connected devices. The advantages attained with EXPLoRa-SF further lead us to propose a more sophisticated algorithm, named EXPLoRa-AT, which employs an innovative ``ordered waterfilling'' approach which attempts to allocate the spreading factors so as to equalize the Time on Air of the packets transmitted by the system's end devices in each spreading factor's group. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the basic ADR strategy, and particularly the EXPLoRa-AT algorithm appears very robust to different operating conditions and consistently guarantees high bit rates in the case of high traffic loads.}

      \field{abstract}{Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies such as Long Range (LoRa) are emerging that enable power efficient wireless communication over very long distances. LPWAN devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multi-hop network. However, to ensure efficient and reliable communication LPWAN devices often provide a large number of transmission parameters. For example, a LoRa device can be configured to use different spreading factors, bandwidth settings, coding rates and transmission powers, resulting in over 6720 possible settings. It is a challenge to determine the setting that minimises transmission energy cost while meeting the required communication performance. This paper is the first to present a thorough analysis of the impact of LoRa transmission parameter selection on communication performance. We study in detail the impact of parameter settings on energy consumption and communication reliability. Using this study we develop a link probing regime which enables us to quickly determine transmission settings that satisfy performance requirements. The presented work is a first step towards an automated mechanism for LoRa transmission parameter selection that a deployed LoRa network requires, but is not yet specified within the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) framework.}

      \field{abstract}{Low power wide area networks are gaining interest to connect thousands of nodes to the internet of things. However, because the link budget in these networks is huge, nodes suffer from a near-far effect. Nodes far from the base station cannot send to the base station succesfully when closer nodes are transmitting, causing destructive collisions. LoRa, the considered technology in this paper, is a spread spectrum technology. It is known that spread spectrum is also sensitive to this effect. This paper presents a scheme to efficiently optimize the packet error rate fairness inside a LoRaWAN cell. This is achieved by optimizing the power and spreading factor for each node while avoiding near-far problems by allocating distant users to different channels. Simulations show that the packet error rate can be decreased up to 50\% for edge nodes in a moderate contention scenario where 1 node per 1000m2 transmits every 10 minutes.}

      \field{abstract}{In wireless networks, interferences between transmissions are modelled either in time or frequency domain. In this article, we jointly analyze interferences in the time-frequency domain using a stochastic geometry model assuming the total time-frequency resources to be a two-dimensional plane and transmissions from Internet of Things (IoT) devices time-frequency patterns on this plane. To evaluate the interference, we quantify the overlap between the information packets: provided that the overlap is not too strong, the packets are not necessarily lost due to capture effect. This flexible model can be used for multiple medium access scenarios and is especially adapted to the random time-frequency access schemes used in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs). By characterizing the outage probability and throughput, our approach permits to evaluate the performance of two representative LPWA technologies SigfoxÂ®{} and LoRaWANÂ®.}

      \field{abstract}{We propose analytical models that allow us to investigate the performance of long range wide area network (LoRaWAN) uplink in terms of latency, collision rate, and throughput under the constraints of the regulatory duty cycling, when assuming exponential inter-arrival times. Our models take into account sub-band selection and the case of sub-band combining. Our numerical evaluations consider specifically the European ISM band, but the analysis is applicable to any coherent band. Protocol simulations are used to validate the proposed models. We find that sub-band selection and combining have a large effect on the quality of service (QoS) experienced in an LoRaWAN cell for a given load. The proposed models allow for the optimization of resource allocation within a cell given a set of QoS requirements and a traffic model.}

      \field{abstract}{LoRaWAN is gaining momentum in the arena of IoT connectivity technologies thanks to the low cost, ease of deployment, and support for adaptable transmission rates and bidirectional communications. The research community has then been working to develop suitable analytical models that can be instrumental in the study of this technology. In this work we propose a mathematical model that makes it possible to accurately estimate the packet success probability of a LoRaWannetwork in presence of bi-directional traffic, i.e., both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions, and that accounts for the most critical features of the LoRa chipset and the LoRaWanstandard. The proposed model, furthermore, makes it possible to study the effect of different parameters configurations, thus offering a valid tool to investigate possible improvements to the system configuration. The proposed model is first validated by comparison with some accurate simulation results and, then, its potential is exemplified by analyzing the system settings that yield the best network performance.}

      \field{abstract}{The need for low power, long range and low cost connectivity to meet the requirements of IoT applications has led to the emergence of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networking technologies. The promise of these technologies to wirelessly connect massive numbers of geographically dispersed devices at a low cost continues to attract a great deal of attention in the academic and commercial communities. Several rollouts are already underway even though the performance of these technologies is yet to be fully understood. In light of these developments, tools to carry out 'what-if analyses' and predeployment studies are needed to understand the implications of choices that are made at design time. While there are several promising technologies in the LPWA space, this paper specifically focuses on the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology. In particular, we present LoRaWANSim, a simulator which extends the LoRaSim tool to add support for the LoRaWAN MAC protocol, which employs bidirectional communication. This is a salient feature not available in any other LoRa simulator. Subsequently, we provide vital insights into the performance of LoRaWAN based networks through extensive simulations. In particular, we show that the achievable network capacity reported in earlier studies is quite optimistic. The introduction of downlink traffic can have a significant impact on the uplink throughput. The number of transmit attempts recommended in the LoRaWAN specification may not always be the best choice. We also highlight the energy consumption versus reliability trade-offs associated with the choice of number of retransmission attempts.}

      \field{abstract}{Long Range (LoRa) communication has been proposed to connect massive numbers of devices in large areas. LoRa itself is a physical layer technique. Together with the MAC layer solution LoRaWAN to realize IoT, they have attracted increasing attention from both industry and academia. In this work, we present our implemented LoRaWAN module for ns-3, to help boost the research in this rising area. Our implementation is compliant with the class A of the LoRaWAN 1.0 specification. It is highly configurable and thus can be easily used to exploit the impact of different parameters on LoRaWAN's performance. Our implemented flexible backbone architecture also allows for the easy integration of new protocols to improve the network performance. In the past two years, we have used this module to develop new protocols and algorithms to improve LoRaWAN's performance, in terms of reliability, capture effect, scalability, power consumption, among others. Our research outcomes have demonstrated the usefulness, flexibility, and configurability of the proposed LoRaWAN ns-3 module. We have made the source code of our module publicly available1.}

      \field{abstract}{Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are expected to interconnect a high number of simple and inexpensive devices. The ability to control transmission parameters including modulation scheme and output power, enables reduction of the deployment costs, improvement of the network reliability, in terms of error performance under suboptimal conditions, and could contribute to the reduction of the maintenance complexity with respect to scaling of the network. This paper presents an analysis of the widely accepted adaptive data rate (ADR) algorithm implementation used in current LoRaWAN\texttrademark{}-based network infrastructures. The authors propose improved variants of the algorithm concerning the design goals listed above and provide an experimental evaluation of their network performance.}

      \field{abstract}{Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) emerged to cover the needs of Internet of Things (IoT)-devices for operational longevity and long operating range. Among LPWANs, Long Range (LoRa) WAN has been the most promising; an upcoming IoT protocol, already adopted by big mobile operators like KPN and TTN. With LoRaWANs, IoT-devices transmit data to their corresponding gateways over many kilometers in a single hop and with 1\% duty-cycle. However, in a LoRa network, any device claims the channel for data-transmission without performing channel-sensing or synchronization with other devices. This increases humongously the number of collisions of information-packets when the number of IoT-devices that are connected per gateway increases. To improve the utilization of the channel, we propose the application of persistent-Carrier Sense Multiple Access (p-CSMA) protocols on the MAC layer of LoRaWANs. In this manuscript, we report on the initial design of a p-CSMA component for the simulation of LoRa networks in ns3. In particular, the classes adding p-CSMA functionality to the IoT-devices are presented. Additionally, the dependencies and relations between these classes and an existing LoRaWAN module on which they apply are detailed. Further, we evaluate this new p-CSMA LoRaWAN module in terms of Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) by simulating LoRa networks. The current report is the first step in the creation of a holistic p-CSMA module, directed to support network-researchers and connoisseurs in simulating all aspects of LoRa networks in ns3.}

      \field{abstract}{Internet of Things devices communicate using a variety of protocols, differing in many aspects, with the channel access method being one of the most important. Most of the transmission technologies explicitly designed for IoT and machine-to-machine communication use either an ALOHA-based channel access or some type of Listen Before Talk strategy, based on carrier sensing. In this article, we provide a comparative overview of the uncoordinated channel access methods for Internet of Things technologies, namely ALOHA-based and Listen Before Talk schemes, in relation to the ETSI and FCC regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, we provide a performance comparison of these access schemes, in terms of both successful transmissions and energy efficiency, in a typical Internet of Things deployment. Results show that Listen Before Talk is effective in reducing inter-node interference even for long-range transmissions, although the energy efficiency can be lower than that provided by ALOHA methods. Furthermore, the adoption of rate adaptation schemes lowers the energy consumption while improving the fairness among nodes at different distances from the receiver. Coexistence issues are also investigated, showing that in massive deployments Listen Before Talk is severely affected by the presence of ALOHA devices in the same area.}
