ABSTRACT
To study signals on networks, to detect epidemics, or to predict blackouts, we need to understand network topology and its impact on the behavior of network processes. The high dimensionality of large networks presents signiÔ¨Åcant analytical and computational challenges; only speciÔ¨Åc network structures have been studied without approximation. We consider the impact of network topology on the limiting behavior of a dynamical process obeying the stochastic rules of SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemics using the scaled SIS process. We introduce the network effect ratio, which captures the preference of individual agents versus the preference of society (i.e., network) and investigate its effects.

1. INTRODUCTION
Network processes model dynamical interactions between a large but Ô¨Ånite number of agents. They are difÔ¨Åcult to study using experiments due to their scale. Computer simulations lack explanatory ability and the ability to investigate what-if scenarios. Investigating what-if scenarios requires re-running the simulation, which may be time-consuming and expensive depending on the complexities of the simulations.
Previously in [1, 2], we studied a network process model called the scaled SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) process. The stochastic interaction rules between individuals are based on the general framework of the SIS epidemics model. The generality of the model makes it an appropriate approximation for cascading failures, where infection corresponds to failure and healing to recovery or the diffusion of rumors in social networks [3]. The advantage of the scaled SIS process over other network process models is that the equilibrium distribution can be described in closed-form without resorting to mean-Ô¨Åeld approximation [4] or assuming speciÔ¨Åc network topologies [5, 6]. Furthermore, we proved that inference problems such as Ô¨Ånding the most-probable conÔ¨Åguration, Ô¨Ånding the marginal probabilities, Ô¨Ånding the expected fraction of infected agents can be solved exactly or approximated efÔ¨Åciently using a polynomial-time algorithm [7].
In this paper, we introduce the network effect ratio, œÉ, which captures the preference of individual agents vs. the preference of the overall network. This is interesting when the preferences of individual agents may oppose that of the network effect dynamics. For example, in epidemics, individual agents prefer to be healthy but the

network effect facilitates the spread of infection rather than keeping nodes healthy; when the individual preferences dominate, most agents in the network will most likely be healthy whereas when the network preference dominates, most agents in the network will be infected.
The network effect ratio of the scaled SIS process gives insights of the nonlinear dependence of network processes on dynamics parameters. We also show that solution of the Most-Probable ConÔ¨Åguration Problem, which solves for the conÔ¨Åguration with the maximum equilibrium probability, depends only on the network effect ratio rather than on the individual or network preferences. Section 2 brieÔ¨Çy reviews the dynamics of the scaled SIS process and the Most-Probable ConÔ¨Åguration Problem; more detail descriptions can be found in [1, 2]. Section 3 deÔ¨Ånes the network effect ratio, œÉ. Section 3.2 shows that the most-probable conÔ¨Åguration remains invariant for the same network effect ratio. Section 4 concludes the paper.
2. SCALED SIS PROCESS
Consider a population with N agents whose relationships are described by an unweighted, undirected network, G(V, E). Each node in G denotes an individual agent. An edge exists between two agents if there are interactions (i.e., contacts) between them. When G(V, E) is a complete graph, this reÔ¨Çects homogeneous mixing; an agent is in contact with every other agent in the network. Network G(V, E) with a less symmetric graph structure reÔ¨Çects heterogeneous mixing of the population.
The scaled SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) process, {X(t), t ‚â• 0}, considers microscopic interactions between individual agents in the population. The state of the scaled SIS process at time t is the N -length vector of the state of all the individual agents,
X(t) = x = [x1, x2, . . . , xN ]T ,
where xi denotes the state of the ith agent. If the ith agent is heathy but susceptible, then xi = 0. If the ith agent is infected, then xi = 1. We call xi the agent state and x the network conÔ¨Åguration. By retaining the state of individual agents, the scaled SIS process allows much Ô¨Åner degree of detail than traditional compartmental models; it allows us to determine which agents in the population are more vulnerable to infection.
The network conÔ¨Åguration, X(t), evolves stochastically in time. Based on the standard SIS framework, infected agents heal and healthy agents become infected. The scaled SIS process is a binary-state, continuous-time Markov process. See [1] for details. The dynamics are determined by 3 parameters: Œª, Œ≥, Œº and the underlying network topology, G(V, E). The scaled SIS process

assumes that the infection rate of a healthy agent is exponentially dependent on the number of infected neighbors. The process assumes the following state transitions:

1. X(t) transitions to the conÔ¨Åguration where the ith agent (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ) is infected with transition rate

q(x, Hix) = ŒªŒ≥mi ,

(1)

where mi =

N j=1

1(xj

=

1)Aij

is

the

number

of

infected

neighbors of node i. The symbol 1(¬∑) is the indicator func-

tion, and A = [Aij] is the adjacency matrix of G(V, E).

2. X(t) transitions to the conÔ¨Åguration where the jth agent (j = 1, . . . , N ) is healed with transition rate:

q(x, Hj‚Ä¢x) = Œº.

(2)

We call Œº > 0 the healing rate. The parameter Œª > 0 is the

exogenous (i.e., spontaneous) infection rate since, if mi = 0, the infection rate is Œª. The parameter Œ≥ > 0 is the contagion factor

since it is scaled by the number of infected neighbors. The scaled

SIS epidemics model does not have an absorbing state because of

exogenous infection and healing. The state space of the scaled SIS process is X and the size of the state space is 2N .

In [1], we proved that the equilibrium distribution of the scaled

SIS process is

œÄ(x)

=

1 Z

(x) ,

(3)

where

H(x) = 1T x log

Œª Œº

+

log(Œ≥).

(4)

The partition function, Z, ensures that the equilibrium distribution is

a true probability distribution. The adjacency matrix, A, of the un-

derlying network explicitly appears in the equilibrium distribution.

The term 1T x is the number of infected agents in conÔ¨Åguration x

and

xT Ax 2

is

the

number

of

infected

edges

(i.e.,

whose

end

nodes are infected).

2.1. Regime Parameters

The

equilibrium

distribution

depends

on

Œª Œº

and

Œ≥,

which

are

both

unitless scaling factors. The preference of the individual agents is

represented by

Œª Œº

,

which

we

call

the

effective

healing

rate.

When

0

<

Œª Œº

<

1, individual agents prefer the healthy state more as the

healing rate, Œº, is larger than the spontaneous infection rate, Œª. In-

dividual

agents

prefer the

infected

state

more

when

Œª Œº

>

1.

Individ-

ual agents have no preference for either the infected or healthy state

when

Œª Œº

=

1.

When Œ≥ > 1, an additional number of infected neighbors in-

crease the infection rate of a healthy agent; contagion rate is biased

toward using the network structure for spreading infection. When

0 < Œ≥ < 1, an additional number of infected neighbors decrease the

infection rate of a healthy agent. When Œ≥ = 1, the infection rate of a

healthy agent does not depend on its number of infected neighbors.

We can divide the parameter space into 4 different regimes:

I)

Healing Dominant: 0 <

Œª Œº

‚â§ 1, 0 < Œ≥ ‚â§ 1;

II)

Endogenous Infection Dominant: 0 <

III)

Exogenous Infection Dominant:

Œª Œº

> 1, 0 < Œ≥ ‚â§ 1;

IV)

Infection Dominant:

Œª Œº

> 1, Œ≥ > 1.

In Regime II) and Regime III), individual preference opposes the

network preference. Regime II) Exogenous Infection Dominant:

but network effect spreads infection.

2.2. Most-Probable ConÔ¨Åguration Problem

The Most-Probable ConÔ¨Åguration Problem solves for the conÔ¨Ågu-
ration with the highest equilibrium probability. The most-probable conÔ¨Åguration, x‚àó, is the network conÔ¨Åguration that we would most
likely observe at equilibrium:

x‚àó = arg max œÄ(x) = arg max H(x).

The solution of the Most-Probable ConÔ¨Åguration Problem (5)

depends on the adjacency matrix of the underlying network, A, and

the dynamics of the process through

Œª Œº

and Œ≥.

The most-probable

conÔ¨Åguration is particularly interesting in Regime II) Exogenous

Infection Dominant, where

Œª Œº

>

1, 0

Œ≥

In this regime, the

topology-dependent process (controlled by Œ≥) opposes the topology-

independent process (controlled by Œª, Œº). We showed in [1, 2]

that many of the most-probable conÔ¨Ågurations are non-degenerate;

in these non-degenerate most-probable conÔ¨Ågurations, subsets of

agents are infected while others are healthy. In Regime II), the solu-

tion of the Most-Probable ConÔ¨Åguration Problem corresponds to the

minimum of a submodular function [2]. We can use Max-Flow/Min-

Cut algorithm to solve efÔ¨Åciently this combinatorial optimization

problem [10].

3. NETWORK EFFECT RATIO We deÔ¨Åne the network effect ratio, œÉ, as

œÉ = log(Œ≥) ,

(7)

log

Œª Œº

where|¬∑| is the absolute value function. Taking the absolute value is

a convenience since œÉ may be positive or negative depending on the

value of the dynamics parameters Œª, Œ≥, Œº.

The network effect ratio is the ratio of the network preference,

as represented by the endogenous infection parameter, Œ≥, and the in-

dividual preference,

as represented by the parameter

Œª Œº

.

When the

numerator term dominates, the equilibrium behavior of the scaled

SIS process is determined by the contagion dynamics; in the case of

epidemics, this means that the scaled SIS process is driven toward

increasing the number of infected agents. When the denominator

term dominates, the equilibrium behavior is determined by the dy-

namics of individual agents; in the case of epidemics, this means

that the scaled SIS process is driven toward increasing the number

of healthy agents.

3.1. Nonlinear Behavior

According to (7), the network ratio, œÉ, does not scale linearly with

changes

of

parameters,

Œª Œº

and

Œ≥.

For

example,

Œ±œÉ = log(Œ±Œ≥) .

log

Œª Œº

Instead the network ratio scales linearly with exponential changes of parameters,

Œ±œÉ = log(Œ≥Œ±) .

log

Œª Œº

Further, the ratio of network preference to individual preference is highly nonlinear due to the natural log function. Figure 1 plots the natural log, log(x), and the absolute natural log function, log(x) .
The function log(x) is not smooth. The behavior of the function depends on if 0 < x < 1 or if x > 1; there is a bend at x = 1. This shows that the network effect ratio is sensitive to the parameter regime of the scaled SIS process, especially when the parameters are either >> 1 or << 1.

3.2. Invariance of the Most-Probable ConÔ¨Åguration Problem
The most-probable conÔ¨Åguration, x‚àó, is invariant if the network effect ratio, œÉ, remains the same.

network, {X1(t), t ‚â• 0} and {X2(t), t ‚â• 0}, with parame-

ters

then the most-probable conÔ¨Åguration of both processes, x‚àó1 and x‚àó2, is the same.

In regime II), the network prefers to spread infection Œ≥ > 1; as Œ≥

increases, corresponding to stronger contagion effect and a stronger

preference for the network spread infection, the effect on the network

effect ratio, œÉ, gradually reaches near saturation.

In regime II), the individual prefers to remain in the healthy state

with 0

<

Œª Œº

‚â•

1; as

Œª Œº

decreases, corresponding to faster heal-

ing rate and stronger individual preference to remain healthy, the

effect on the network effect ratio, œÉ, increases rapidly. This means

that a small strengthening of the individual preference for all agents

to remain healthy (i.e., increasing healing rate) can signiÔ¨Åcantly im-

pact the equilibrium behavior of the scaled SIS process provided that

Œª Œº

<<

1.

On the other hand, when the network preference is already

strong (i.e., Œ≥ >> 1), a small increase of the contagion rate will

have little impact on the equilibrium behavior of the scaled SIS

process. However, if the network preference is weak (i.e., Œ≥ ‚âà 1),

then a small increase in the contagion rate will have more impact on

the equilibrium behavior.

The network shown in Figure 2 is a small sample of the Facebook network with N = 4039 users and |E| = 88, 234 connections [11]. This means that the scaled SIS process has 24039 possible conÔ¨Ågurations. As stated in Theorem 3.1, we can see that the mostprobable conÔ¨Åguration is the same for scaled SIS processes with different parameters Œª, Œ≥, Œº in Regime II) but with the same network effect ratio, œÉ.

4. CONCLUSION

Phenomena such as epidemics and cascading failures are results of

dynamical interactions between multiple agents. We are interested

in scenarios where the preference of individual agents opposes the

preference of the network dynamic. In epidemics, individuals prefer

to remain in the healthy state whereas the network dynamic evolves

to spread infection through contagion. We showed, using the scaled

SIS process, an analytical network process model, that the equilib-

rium behavior depends on the ratio of the network preference (i.e.,

how quickly infection spreads from infected agent to healthy agent)

and the individual preference (i.e., how quickly individual agents

heal). We called this the network effect ratio, œÉ.

For the scaled SIS process, the network effect ratio depends not on the ratio of the contagion factor, Œ≥, and the effective healing rate,

Œª Œº

,

but

on

the

ratio

of

log

(Œ≥)

and

log

Œª Œº

. This means that the equi-

librium behavior of the scaled SIS process scales nonlinearly with

Furthermore,

tion, x‚àó at equilibrium.
