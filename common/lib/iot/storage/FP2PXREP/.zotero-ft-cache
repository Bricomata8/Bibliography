Abstract— In wake-up radio (WuR)-enabled wireless sensor networks, data communication among nodes is triggered in an on-demand manner, by either a sender or a receiver. For receiverinitiated WuR (RI-WuR), a receiving node wakes up sending nodes through a wake-up call. Correspondingly sending nodes transmit packets in a traditional way by competing with one another multiple times in a single operational cycle. In this paper, we propose a receiver-initiated consecutive packet transmission WuR (RI-CPT-WuR) medium access control (MAC) protocol, which eliminates multiple competitions to achieve higher energy efﬁciency. Furthermore, we develop two associated discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs) for evaluating the performance of RI-CPT-WuR and an existing RI-WuR MAC protocol. Using the solutions from the DTMC models, closed-form expressions for network throughput, average delay, packet reliability ratio, energy consumption and lifetime, and energy efﬁciency for both protocols are obtained. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the RI-CPT-WuR protocol.

I. INTRODUCTION
T HE advent of 5G has brought faster and seamless connectivity in wireless and mobile communications [1]. One of the 5G based emerging paradigms is the Internet of things (IoT) coupled with wireless sensor networks (WSNs), for developing smart applications such as smart cities, smart grid and smart automation [2]. Particularly, from the recent surge in research on Industry 4.0 and factories of the future, the WSNs integrated with industrial IoT have been an important technology for industrial automation, industrial monitoring, and control applications [3], [4]. When developing protocols for IoT applications, deterministic delivery, reliability, and energy efﬁciency are usually key design parameters [5], [6].

As a crucial resource, the battery capacity of IoT devices is ﬁxed and cannot be recharged without energy harvesting. To this end, the recently developed wake-up radio (WuR) technology exhibits its convincing superiority for energy consumption [7], [8]. Although there exist techniques such as duty cycling (DC) for energy conservation, WuR revolutionizes the operation of WSN data transmission by allowing nodes work at a power consumption level that is 1000 times lower than that of the traditional radio [9]. A WuR enabled WSN node contains two radios, one main radio (MR) plus one wake-up radio. The MR is primarily responsible for data exchange and the WuR is used to wake up MR. While the WuR is always on to receive wake-up calls (WuCs) from any other node [10], the MR is in the off or sleep mode for most of the time and it is switched to on or active only when needed. Note that the active and sleep periods apply only to MRs. WuCs in WuR are generated in two ways, i.e., either transmitterinitiated (TI) [11] or receiver-initiated (RI) [10]. For RI-WuR, a receiver initiates data transmissions by transmitting a WuC to senders to switch on their MRs.
On the other hand, in order to provide deterministic and reliable communication, a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based medium access control (MAC) protocol could be adopted in many industrial applications [12]. To employ TDMA MAC is expected to render reliable communication for a synchronized network by avoiding competition among nodes. For asynchronous networks, however, enabling contentionbased MAC protocol similar to carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is a better option for improving medium utilization. In CSMA/CA, only active nodes (with data packets to transmit) contend and the other inactive nodes do not participate in access competition [13]. Thus medium utilization is higher in CSMA/CA at a cost of lower reliability due to collisions. Clearly, reducing the number of competitions leads to fewer occurrences of collisions, leading to increased data transmission reliability. We take this fact as the motivation to propose a CSMA/CA based protocol for faster and more reliable data communications in WuR enabled WSNs. The protocol is targeted at WSNs in the context of industrial as well as general purpose applications.
In this paper, we propose a receiver-initiated consecutive packet transmission WuR (RI-CPT-WuR) MAC protocol that allows a node transmit multiple packets one by one

consecutively after winning an access competition. In other words, RI-CPT-WuR MAC enables transmitting multiple packets through a single competition, whereas a competition is always needed for each packet transmission when a traditional RI-WuR is employed. Hence, RI-CPT-WuR provides fast packet delivery and is highly reliable in comparison with RI-WuR. Moreover, RI-CPT-WuR allows other nodes to sleep during the period when the medium is occupied by the sending node in order to boost energy efﬁciency.
Furthermore, we develop a set of two associated discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs) to model both RI-WuR and RI-CPT-WuR MAC as Markov chains are popular for modeling IoT MAC protocols [14]. One of these two DTMCs captures the queuing nature of packets in a reference node (RN) while the other one models the number of active nodes in the same cluster, hereafter referred to as node DTMC and system DTMC respectively. Furthermore, we illustrate the way how those DTMCs are operated jointly to incorporate with each other for evaluating network performance. Using the solution obtained from DTMC modeling, we perform analysis for ﬁve performance metrics and validate the accuracy of the models via discrete-event simulations.
In this study, we model RI based MAC protocols for WuR enabled WSNs for intra-cluster data communication, as shown in Fig. 1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst effort to develop analytical models for multiple competitions in a cycle for receiver-initiated MAC protocols in WuR enabled WSNs. A summary of the main contributions is as follows:
• A receiver-initiated consecutive packet transmission MAC protocol for WuR embedded WSNs is proposed. A salient feature of RI-CPT-WuR MAC is that it reserves the medium for a node to transmit multiple packets consecutively. Therefore, it needs fewer competitions to deliver all packets from all competing nodes.

• Two DTMC models to evaluate the performance of RI based WuR protocols are developed. The node DTMC models the queuing nature of consecutive packet transmission by a node whereas the system DTMC models the evolution of the active nodes in the network. Then these two DTMCs are integrated in order to model the behavior of consecutive packet transmissions via multiple competitions in one cycle.
• Closed-form expressions for calculating network throughput, mean packet delay, packet reliability ratio, energy consumption and lifetime, and energy efﬁciency are obtained based on the proposed models. Furthermore, the analytical model has been shown to be very accurate, validated via discrete-event based simulations.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. After summarizing the related work in Section II, we present the network scenario and protocol design in Section III. The DTMC models are developed in Section IV. Then, expressions for performance metrics are derived in Section V. In Section VI, we present the numerical results obtained by the proposed analytical model and discrete-event simulations. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section VII.
II. RELATED WORK
In recent years, WuR is increasingly gaining its popularity as it provides ultra-low energy communication by diminishing energy consumption due to idle listening and overhearing in traditional DC WSNs [9], [10]. However, overhearing could still happen during the data transmission phase when existing WuR MAC protocols are employed in a network with multiple contending nodes. In many WuR implementations, the WuC is transmitted as a unicast message in order to wake up an intended node. This type of WuC transmissions adopts a polling-based mechanism. In this paper, we analyze broadcast-based WuC transmissions, in which all nodes wake up simultaneously after a common WuC is received and those nodes which have at least one packet to transmit will compete with each other for channel access. If a node does not have any packet to transmit, it will go to sleep immediately. In Table I above, we make a qualitative comparison of a few popular WuR protocols versus RI-CPT-WuR which is proposed in the paper. On the other hand, it is also imperative to develop transmitter-initiated WuR protocols. As an effort

towards this direction, we have proposed three protocols in another recent paper [35].
For performance evaluation, there exist many analytical models in the literature for evaluating MAC protocols in WSNs. For instance, a few DTMC models were developed to evaluate synchronous MAC protocols which employ common awake scheduling for packet transmissions in DC WSNs [15]–[17]. Moreover, a multiple packet transmission scheme was analyzed in [18] for synchronous DC MAC protocols with a limited number of slots for access competition. Recently, two analytical models [19], [20] were proposed to evaluate asynchronous MAC protocols such as RI-MAC protocol [21] in which nodes follow their own wake-up schedules. However, the aforementioned models are not suitable to model the WuR based MAC protocols.
For performance evaluation of WuRs, existing contributions are mainly based on simulations and testbeds, with few mathematical models. For example, a simulation based performance evaluation was performed in [9] and [10] including both TI- and RI-WuR MAC protocols. When it comes to modeling of protocols leveraging WuR, merely TI-WuR protocols were modeled so far. For example, a DTMC was developed to model backoff enabled TI-WuR based WSNs in [11], assuming the same contention window size in every cycle. Similarly, an absorbing Markov chain model was developed for analyzing TI-WuR in [14] and [22]considering that the number of failures follows a geometric distribution. However, that model was developed from a single node point of view, not based on the actual MAC level competition among multiple nodes. Moreover, TI-WuR was analyzed mathematically in [23] but collisions that could occur in packet transmission were neglected in their analysis.
To analyze RI-WuR, a common approach in the literature is to adopt the RI-MAC protocol [21] directly over WuR. Although there exist few mathematical models including [19] to analyze the RI-MAC protocol, so far no analytical model is proposed to analyze RI-MAC combined with WuR. Later on in this paper, we model both the RI-WuR and our proposed RI-CPT-WuR MAC protocols using DTMCs. For performance evaluation, many models were developed for networks under saturated conditions [11], [14]. In case of low data rate applications, such as industrial or ﬁeld monitoring scenarios, it might be possible that there are no or few sensed data packets available during certain reporting cycles.
Our developed modeling framework captures this phenomenon and studies both unsaturated and saturated network conditions. Furthermore, these models are applicable to data transmissions where nodes need to compete each time for a single packet transmission, as well as transmitting packets consecutively through a single competition. When a node transmits multiple packets consecutively, it could occupy medium until all of its packets are delivered. Then it becomes inactive after this CPT. Consequently, there would be a lower number of competing nodes in the rest of a cycle. Our modeling framework incorporates this active node evolution in order to get a complete picture for a network-level analysis.

III. NETWORK SCENARIO AND WUR MAC PROTOCOLS
In typical IoT data reporting and collecting scenarios, a sink node receives sensed data from multiple sensor nodes. Consider a cluster of N sensor nodes that transmit packets towards a common one-hop away sink node, as shown in Fig. 1. This section presents the operation of receiverinitiated WuR MAC protocols in such a network. After a WuC which is sent as a broadcast message is received, the sending nodes compete with each other for channel access following the CSMA/CA mechanism. For performance analysis of our protocols, we assume ﬁrst an error-free channel and then extend it to an error-prone channel.
A. Overview of the RI-WuR MAC Protocol
When the original RI-MAC is applied to WuR enabled WSNs, it is referred to as RI-WuR MAC. In the RI-WuR protocol, it is the receiver that initiates the procedure for a data transmissions. When a receiving node is ready to collect data, it broadcasts an unaddressed WuC via its MR to all nodes in the same cluster. The duration between two WuC generations will be calculated in Section V. Upon receiving a WuC, all nodes switch on their MRs and follow a backoff mechanism for channel access competition. Then the winning node transmits a packet successfully. The receiving node informs the reception status and triggers a new transmission using a broadcast message called beacon (B). If a sending node does not have any packet to transmit, it turns off its MR immediately. The receiving node switches its MR off when there is no response to the sent B, i.e., in case of either the last active node has ﬁnished its transmission or there is no active node at the time when a B message is sent.
The operation of RI-WuR is illustrated in Fig. 2. For the ease of illustration, we divide the active period, excluding WuC, of a receiver into slots where one slot is conﬁgured as the duration for transmitting a DATA packet and a beacon along with a contention window (CW) duration. Nodes compete in every slot as long as they have packets in their queues. Consider an arbitrarily selected node as the RN and assume that the RN is the winner in the ﬁrst slot. After gaining channel access, the RN transmits one packet to the sink node. Then the second slot starts. As an example shown in Fig. 2, packet transmission will not take place in the second slot due to a collision. In case of a collision, B informs the unsuccessful reception of the sent packet. The packet transmission continues to the third slot with another node, Node 1 as the winner. A sending node’s sleep period starts after the transmission of its last packet. Thus, each node contains its own awake duration in a cycle depending on the queue length. Accordingly, the receiving node sleeps after completing the data exchange with the longest awaken node, Node 2 in Fig. 2.
B. Operation of the RI-CPT-WuR MAC Protocol
In a network or a network cluster containing multiple nodes, all nodes that have packets to transmit contend in every operational slot for channel access in order to send their packets

when RI-WuR is employed. However, only one node wins channel access and transmits. Meanwhile the other contending nodes need to listen to the ongoing packet exchange. There are two disadvantages with this approach. Firstly, the same amount of energy is consumed by the nodes other than the winning node due to overhearing. Thus substantial energy is wasted for those nodes which lost access contention. Secondly, a node has to compete in every slot as long as it has a packet to transmit. Consequently, more collisions would occur, reducing the reliability of packet delivery. To address these two problems, we propose below an RI-CPT-WuR protocol to improve energy efﬁciency and reliability for data transmission in WuR enabled WSNs.
The main idea of RI-CPT-WuR is to reserve the medium in subsequent slots based on the queue size of the winning node for multi-packet transmissions. When the sink node initiates a data collection procedure by a WuC message, all sending nodes turn on their MRs to participate in channel access competition. The winning node captures the medium and sends its ﬁrst packet from its queue of length q packets. After receiving this packet and an acknowledgment beacon from the sink, all other nodes go to sleep for the next q − 1 slots. Thus, the next competition takes place after q − 1 slots and the current winning node will not participate in the next competition. In case of a collision from the ﬁrst round, access competition will resume in the next immediate slot since the B message from the sink informs failed reception of the packet. Note that a B message is always needed after each DATA packet transmission no matter the onging transmission was successful or not.
The operation of RI-CPT-WuR is illustrated in Fig. 3, based on an example with Q = 3 and N = 3. Note that while Q represents the maximum queue size, q refers to the queue length of the RN, and q ≤ Q. Assume that the RN with q = 3 is the winner in the ﬁrst slot. It transmits three

packets consecutively to the sink node. After the ﬁrst packet transmission, all other nodes go to sleep for the next 2 slots. A new round of access competition starts in Slot 4 however with only two nodes since the RN has become inactive. It is shown that another competition in Slot 5 with Node 2 as the winner, since a collision happened in Slot 4. Finally, Node 2 with q = 1 is the only remaining node in Slot 7 and it sends its packet. Afterwards both the sink and Node 2 go to sleep.

IV. DTMC MODELS
In this section, we ﬁrst introduce DTMC modeling and explain its applicability to DC MAC protocol analysis. Then, we develop two DTMC models and integrate those models jointly in order to calculate successful transmission probability.
A DTMC model represents a stochastic process containing a ﬁnite space with multiple states in which a state transition occurs with a probability dependent only on the most recent transition. A state in the DTMC evolves at each time step. All state transitions happen based on the probability of occurring events like arrivals and departures. At each state, the summation of exiting probabilities is equal to 1 and the stationary probabilities π are obtained by

π = π P, π e = 1,

(1)

where π is the stationary distribution vector and e is a column vector of ones.
The DTMC based modeling approach suits well for analyzing DC MAC protocols [24]. This is because protocols following DC have periodicity in the time domain, allowing to partition the observation time into cycles. Each cycle has on duration to perform data exchange activities while the rest of the cycle is o f f . As DC MAC protocols have discrete periods of time and events (arrivals and departures) occur in the on duration of every cycle, it is straightforward to apply DTMCs in order to evaluate the performance of such protocols.

A node goes to sleep if it has lost the competition for the next q − 1 slots. Note that the nodes compete in the next immediate slot after occurring a collision, however, the previous winning node would not participate in this competition.

A. Node DTMC for RI-WuR

The node DTMC models the evolution of the number of

packets over time in the queue of the RN with respect to

transmissions and arrivals. Denote the arrival rate by λ. Then

the probability that i packets arrive into a node queue during a cycle of length T is Ai = (λT )i · e−λT /i !. In RI-WuR,

the cycle length, T , is variable as to be explained in Sec. V.

We calculate correspondingly the average cycle duration and

incorporate it into the models. The probability of arriving

i or more packets during T is A≥i = 1 −

i −1 j =0

Aj.

Let

P(i, j )

be the probability of ﬁnding j packets in the queue at cycle

t +1, conditioned on that i packets are available in the queue of

the RN at cycle t. Furthermore, the probability of transmitting

packets successfully in i slots with a probability ps out of

m + 1 slots would be

m i −1

psi (1 − ps )m−i+1.

As an example, the transition probability from State i to

State j is explained as follows. P(i, j) =

n−1 m =i −1

m i −1

psi

(1 − ps)m−i+1 · A j is the probability of occurring i suc-

cessful transmissions, i.e., i slots successfully, when RI-WuR

is conﬁgured with n maximum number of competing slots

and receiving j packets during a cycle for i = 0, ..., Q and

j = 0, ..., Q.

B. System DTMC for RI-WuR
The evolution of the number of active nodes in the network is modeled by the system DTMC. Let P(k,l) be the probability that l active nodes compete in Cycle t+1, conditioned on that k active nodes competed in Cycle t. When k nodes are active in a slot of a cycle, the probability for occurring a successful packet transmission is Sk = k Ps,k−1 and for happening a collision is Sk = 1 − Sk. With a successful transmission, a node’s queue might become empty if there is only one packet before the transmission or it might still be active when there are at least two packets in total. Then, the probability of the RN’s queue

being empty in case of a successful transmission occurred with

a probability ps is Pe = ps A0π1/ ps (1 − π0) and Pe = 1− Pe is the probability that it would not be empty. Here, π0 and π1

are the steady state probabilities for having 0 and 1 packet in

the queue, respectively. Denote Xk = Sk Pe, Xk = Sk + Sk Pe.

Consider that Bk (l) =

l k

Ak Al0−k is the probability that k out

of l nodes become active in a cycle, where A = 1 − A0.

The transition probabilities of the system DTMC are deﬁned

in Table III. The transition probability, P(k,l) =

k−1 r =0

Bl (N),

can

be

explained

as

follows.

From the above paragraph, it is clear that Xk is the probability

of occurring a state reduction by 1 in the system DTMC,

i.e., the number of available active nodes for competition in the

next slot is k − 1. Moreover, Xk is the probability of occurring no change in a state due to either a successful transmission but

the node is still active or the node is not contending in the slot

since it has no packet. Then,

k−1 r =0

X k−r

gives

the

probability

that the competition succeeded and nodes go empty in k slots

and no state change occurs in the other n − k slots with

the probability of

k−1 r =0

·

k−1 v =0

Xk−v .

Furthermore,

Bl

(N)

is

the probability that l out of N inactive nodes become active.

Finally, the product of all the above explained probabilities gives P(k,l) for k = 0, ..., N and l = 0, ..., N.

C. DTMC Models for RI-CPT-WuR

Recall that the key feature of the RI-CPT-WuR MAC

protocol is to transmit all packets that a node has consecutively

once it wins a channel access competition. Accordingly,

the node DTMC is modiﬁed as mentioned in Table IV.

In this table,

m 0

ps(1 −

ps)m ·

Aj

is

the

probability

of

performing 1 successful transmission out of m + 1 slots as

one successful contention is enough to transmit all packets

in a cycle for a node. Then, the node status becomes

idle and it would not participate in the next competition.

Therefore, Pe is not required in the system DTMC for RI-CPT-WuR. Correspondingly, the system DTMC is modiﬁed with Sk instead of using Xk, as mentioned in Table V.

D. The Calculation of ps

Denote {πi } as the stationary distribution of the node DTMC

DTMC. with the

transition probabilities from the corresponding tables.

From the node DTMC in Table II and (1), π0 ( ps) is obtained. Similarly, from the system DTMC in Table III

and (1), ps (π0) is obtained as calculated below. The fraction of cycles where k other nodes and the RN are active, αk , is given by

αk =

N −1 k

πk +1 /

N k +1

= (k + 1) πk+1/N.

Then, the probability of having k + 1 active nodes including the RN in a cycle is

N −1
αk (π0) = αk /G; k = 0, . . . N − 1, G = αk .
k=0

When the RN is contending with other k, 0 ≤ k ≤

N − 1 nodes, the probability that the RN transmits a packet

successfully (successfully or with a failure), is given by Ps,k =

W −1 1 i=0 W

W −1−i W

k
( Ps f,k =

W −1 1 i=0 W

W −i k ),
W

where W is the contention backoff window size. Now, ps (π0) can be expressed as

N −1

ps (π0) = αk (π0) Ps,k.

(2)

k=0

Clearly, ps can be obtained by solving π0 ( ps) and ps (π0). Hence, both the system and the node DTMCs should be

operated interactively until the solution is converged. In the

same way, ps f can be calculated by replacing Ps,k with
Ps f,k in (2).
Similarly, by following the above procedure but using DTMCs in Tables IV and V, both pscpt and pscpf t for RI-CPT-WuR can be calculated.

V. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this section, we ﬁrst derive expressions for throughput, delay, packet reliability ratio, energy consumption and lifetime, as well as energy efﬁciency for the both RI-WuR and the RI-CPT-WuR MAC protocols, and then extend our analysis to error-prone channels. Note that the notations mentioned in the superscript of an expression are corresponding to the respective protocol (ri or cpt) or radio (wur or mr).

A. Duration of a Cycle
The duration between two consecutive wake-up calls is referred to as a cycle. As mentioned earlier, RI-CPT-WuR inherits some features of RI-MAC among which the cycle duration is an important metric in addition to the receiverinitiated operation. Therefore, we adopt the same calculation for RI-CPT-WuR as well for the sake of fair comparison. Accordingly, the sleep duration with length L in a cycle is variable and it varies between 0.5L and 1.5L following the uniform distribution [21]. Correspondingly, each cycle consists of a sleep duration generated randomly in the range of 0.5L and 1.5L. Therefore the average sleep interval of a cycle in this range is given by,

sl = (0.5L + 1.5L)/2 = L.

(3)

In receiver-initiated WuR MAC protocols, the active period depends on the number of conﬁgured slots which is decided by the number of retransmissions, R, allowed for a packet, together with N and Q. For a queue size Q and a network of N nodes, the active period contains at most N · Q · (R + 1) slots, i.e., n = N · Q · (R + 1). According to the operation of RI-CPT-WuR, the length of a cycle, Tc, is given by

Tc = n + L.

(4)

B. Node and Network Throughput
Deﬁne the node throughput, η, as the average number of packets successfully delivered by a node in a cycle. In both RI and RI-CPT-WuR MAC protocols, a node transmits all packets from its queue in multiple slots of a cycle. The number

GUNTUPALLI et al.: ENERGY EFFICIENT CONSECUTIVE PACKET TRANSMISSIONS

4739

of packets transmitted in a cycle by a node depends on packet arrival rate λ and the size of its queue, Q. In a cycle, the number of packets that can arrive to a node is λ · T , while the maximum number of packets that can enter into a node is Q. From the DTMC analysis, η is calculated by,

Q

η = i · πi ,

(5)

i =1

where πi is the probability that i packets are available in the RN’s queue. The achievable network throughput expressed in packets per cycle is therefore given by

T h = N · η.

(6)

C. Average Delay

In this study, we deﬁne delay as the number of slots required to deliver η packets successfully in a cycle. In the competition that takes place in a slot, a node wins with a
probability ps. If competition happens in every slot as used in RI-WuR, then the total number of competitions or slots needed to transmit η packets successfully is η/ ps. Differently, RI-CPT-WuR delivers all η packets when winning a competition and avoids (η − 1) competitions. In this case, the number of slots used to transmit η packets is 1/ pscpt + (η − 1). Therefore, the corresponding average delay per cycle in terms
of slots is calculated as,

Dri = η/ ps; Dcpt = 1/ pscpt + (η − 1).

(7)

D. Packet Reliability Ratio

The reliability of a packet transmission in this study refers to
its successful transmission without collision. We measure this
reliability in terms of the number of collisions encountered by a node in order to transmit η packets successfully. The fewer the collisions, the higher the reliability. Accordingly, we deﬁne packet reliability ratio as the number of packets delivered
successfully per collision. For RI-WuR, the number of slots having collisions is nrfi = (η/ ps) · p f , where p f = ps f − ps. For RI-CPT-WuR, it is ncfpt = (1/ pscpt )· pcfpt . Correspondingly, the packet reliability ratios per node for each protocol are given
respectively by

γ ri = 1/nrfi ; γ cpt = η/ncfpt .

(8)

the transmission, reception, and sleep power levels respectively of the WuR or MR. Note that among these energy consumption components we have Es = E f . The reason is as follows. In RI-CPT-WuR, a beacon message sent by the sink is always required after each DATA frame transmission. No matter it indicates the ongoing DATA transmission as successful or failed, the sending node needs to decode the beacon message, thus consuming the same amount of energy.
In a slot, when the RN is active, a successful transmission can occur with a probability ps or a collision may happen with a probability p f . If the RN is inactive, it will sleep. Consider that a cycle contains n slots. Obviously, these n slots include slots with a successful transmission and failed transmission due to collision as well as the slots in which the RN sleeps. It is clear that the energy consumed by the RN in a cycle includes all the energy consumptions during these mentioned slots.
For the RI-WuR operation, the number of successful slots is given by nrsi = η and the number of slots in which a collision happened is nrfi = (η/ ps) · p f . Similarly, the number of successful slots where the RN lost the competition can be calculated as nrl i = (η/ ps) · (1 − ps f ), where ps f = ps + p f . Therefore, the energy consumed by the RN in RI-WuR during an active period of a cycle is given by,
Earictive = (nrsi · Es + nrfi · E f + tW uC · Prwxur ) + nrl i · Eoh + (n −(nrsi + nrfi + nrl i )) · Eina . (9)
For the RI-CPT-WuR operation, the number of successful slots is given by ncspt = η and the number of slots in which a collision happened is ncfpt = (1/ pscpt ) · pcfpt . Similarly, the number of successful slots where the RN lost competition can be calculated as nlcpt = (1/ pscpt) · (1 − pscpf t ). The energy consumed by the RN in RI-CPT-WuR during an active period of a cycle, Eacpcttive can be calculated by replacing nrsi , nrfi , and nrl i values with ncspt , ncfpt , and nlcpt in (9). Therefore, the energy consumed by the RN during a sleep period of a cycle is given, in both RI-WuR and RI-CPT-WuR, by,
Esleep = ((n · Tslot )) · Pswl ur + (T − (n · Tslot ) − tW uC ) · (Prwxur + Psml r ). (10)
Then, the energy consumption in a cycle for each protocol is obtained by,

E = Eactive + Esleep.

(11)

Correspondingly, the lifetime of the RN is determined as,

E. Energy Analysis

To calculate the average energy consumed in a slot,

we consider the following energy consumption components

associated with the RN during: i) a successful transmission

when it contends with other k nodes Es = tD AT A · Ptmxr +

(Tslot − tD AT A) · Prmxr ; ii) a transmission failure (collision)

E f = tD AT A · Ptmxr + (Tslot − tD AT A) · Prmxr ; iii) overhearing

Eoh = Tslot · Prmxr ; and iv) the inactive period Eina = Tslot ·

Psml r ; where Tslot , t transmission times

D AT A are the corresponding slot and and Ptwxur/mr , Prwxur/mr , and Pswl ur/

packet mr are

LT = Einitial /E.

(12)

Finally, the energy efﬁciency of the RN is obtained as,

ξ = η/E.

(13)

F. Performance Analysis When Channel Is Not Error-Free
Packet error rate (PER) is an important performance parameter representing the ratio between the number of failed transmissions and the total number of transmissions. Generally, interference, noise and channel fading are the

4740

IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, VOL. 18, NO. 11, JUNE 1, 2018

predominant factors that cause errors during packet trans-

missions. These factors can be characterized by signal-to-

noise ratio or signal-to-interference-noise ratio. While many

prior studies concentrated on bit error rate (BER) [25]–[27],

some recent papers have also considered packet or frame error

rate [28]–[30].

In RI-CPT-WuR, a cycle starts from the successful transmis-

sion of a WuC frame, as shown in Fig. 3. Denote by Na the

number of active nodes and by qi the queue length for active

node i . In a cycle, there are β =

Na i =1

qi

number

of

DATA

packets to be transmitted including qi packets from each active

node and a beacon message, i.e., B, that is required after each

DATA transmission. Accordingly, the PER for a whole cycle, denoted by Pecppt , can be calculated as

TABLE VI THE CONFIGURED NETWORK PARAMETERS [10], [11], [21]

β
Pecppt = 1−(1− PeW uC) · [(1− PeD AT A j ) · (1− PeB j )] (14)
j=1

where PeW uC , PeD AT A j , and PeB j are the PER of the WuC, the j th DATA frame, and its corresponding beacon frame

due to channel impairment respectively. To obtain each of

these PER values, the generic relationship between BER, Pb,

and PER, Pe, applies, as Pe = 1 − (1 − Pb) f rame_length. Note that Pecppt represents the fraction of failed packet

transmissions due to channel impairments and it is different

from

P

cpt f

which

is

caused

by

collisions.

While

P

cpt f

happens

during a channel access competition, Pecppt is the consequence

of channel impairment after a node has obtained channel

access. Therefore, when the RI-CPT-WuR MAC protocol is

operating

under

an

error-prone

channel,

both

Pecppt

and

P

cpt f

need to be considered in performance analysis.

Denote by ρscpt the probability of having a successful

packet transmission in an error-prone channel. From the above

discussion, it is obtained by

ρscpt = (1 − Pecppt ) · Pscpt ,

(15)

where Pscpt is the probability of a successful transmission under an error-free channel obtained in Section IV. Clearly, a packet is successfully transmitted only when no channel error happened during the transmission even through the channel is error-prone. Similarly, the probability of a packet transmission in the error-prone environment, ρscfpt , is obtained as

ρscfpt = (1 − Pecppt ) · Pscpt + Pecppt · Pscpt

Correspondingly, the probability of a failed transmission under error-prone conditions, considering both collisions and channel failures, ρcfpt , is obtained by

ρ cf p t

By

respectively, the performance metrics under an error-prone

channel condition can be obtained in the same way as shown

earlier in this section for an error-free channel.

VI. SIMULATIONS AND NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we validate the proposed models by comparing the derived metrics from the models with the results obtained through discrete-event simulations. Both the RI-WuR and RI-CPT-WuR MAC protocols are simulated in a custombuilt simulator using the simulation and modeling programming language (SMPL) [36], [37]. The metric values per cycle reported in this section are the average values calculated over 5 · 106 cycles. The conﬁgured network parameters are listed in Table VI, where S is the packet size and D R is the transmission data rate of the MR.
Recall that the cycle length of a receiver-initiated MAC protocol is variable according to the number of slots. The conﬁgurable number of competing slots in a cycle depends directly on the number of nodes and the queue size, meaning that the duration of a cycle depends on both N and Q. Accordingly, the protocols are evaluated based on the following two conﬁgurations: 1) by varying the number of nodes N with a ﬁxed Q at 5 packets; and 2) by varying the maximum queue capacity Q with N = 5, ﬁrst under error-free channel conditions and then for error-prone channels. To obtain the numerical results presented below, all nodes behave homogeneously according to the adopted MAC protocol, with the same initial energy level as Einitial = 1 J .
A. Performance Comparison With Variable Number of Nodes
From the protocol principle of RI-CPT-WuR, it is clear that one of the essential operations is to complete the transmissions of all packets in the queue by all nodes in a cycle, regardless of queue length. Obviously, the same throughput is achieved by both RI-CPT and RI-WuR protocols as shown in Fig. 4. However, the other performance parameters are protocol speciﬁc. The cycle duration is shorter for a lower N and when few packets arrive at nodes and vice versa. Fig. 4 depicts the network throughput for different number of nodes in the network at a ﬁxed Q = 5 packets. As shown in the ﬁgure,

Fig. 6. Lifetime with different N.

Fig. 8. Delay with different N.

up to N = 4, when few packets arrive at nodes the number of packets accumulated in a cycle is not enough to achieve the maximum throughput. Since the maximum queue length is conﬁgured as Q = 5, each node should contain 5 packets in its queue in order to reach the achievable maximum throughput of η = 5. With N = 5, the cycle duration is sufﬁcient to accumulate 5 packets in the queue of each node, thus achieving the maximum node throughput. It can be observed that the increase in N attains higher T h and the throughput curve moves toward the maximal point.
As mentioned earlier, the higher the number of nodes, the larger the number of slots in a cycle. Accordingly, the energy consumed by the RN is higher in RI-WuR since it overhears the packets from the winning node in all slots. Even in case of collisions, all nodes overhear. As a result, E consumed in RI-WuR increases linearly with the congestion status in the network. On the other hand, RI-CPT-WuR substantially reduces energy consumption by conﬁning overhearing to merely one slot. Therefore, lower energy is consumed in RI-CPT-WuR when compared with RI-WuR, as shown in Fig. 5. Correspondingly, the lifetime of the RN is longer in RI-CPT-WuR. Moreover, the energy efﬁciency is also higher with RI-CPT-WuR due to the transmission of η packets per cycle with lower energy consumption per cycle than the ξ of RI-WuR which transmits the same number of packets but with higher E. In a nutshell, even though both LT and ξ decay with a higher competition, RI-CPT-WuR enhances the performance of these parameters by almost four times as acquired by RI-WuR at N = 10, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7 respectively.

Fig. 9. Packet reliability ratio with different N.
Similarly, the average number of slots required for transmitting all packets in a cycle is lower with the RI-CPT-WuR MAC protocol since it needs fewer competitions in a cycle, as shown in Fig. 8. With a lower number of competitions, the resulted delay with RI-CPT-WuR MAC is shorter by the factor of Q. For the same reason, the number of collisions which take place in RI-CPT-WuR is lower and the packet reliability ratio is higher when compared with RI-WuR, as depicted in Fig. 9. This result can easily be explained by the fact that RI-CPT-WuR delivers η packets with a fewer number of collisions where as RI-WuR delivers the same number of packets with a higher number of collisions. For packet reliability ratio, γ decreases with the node density in the network as ps reduces, RI-CPT-WuR achieves four times higher γ than the one gained by RI-WuR at N = 10.

B. Performance Comparison With Variable Queue Capacity

Fig. 15. Packet reliability ratio as Q varies.

As expected, the duration of cycles is longer with a larger Q and higher throughput is achieved when more packets are generated in the network. Fig. 10 depicts the network throughput with different queue sizes for both protocols. At N = 5, T h reaches its maximum even at Q = 1 and maintains the same for all Q values. Consequently E increases linearly, resulting a shorter lifetime with a larger Q in RI-WuR. In contrast, overhearing is conﬁned in RI-CPT-WuR. So lower energy is consumed and consequently it operates the network for a longer lifetime as presented in Figs. 11 and 12. Moreover, the energy efﬁciency of RI-CPT-WuR is increased signiﬁcantly and it gains almost four times higher than the one obtained by RI-WuR at Q = 10, as shown in Fig. 13. The reason for this result is the linear increment in η with slowly increasing energy consumption. However, the energy

efﬁciency of RI-WuR remains almost stable across different queue capacities with linear increments at the same rate for both η and E.
As illustrated in Fig. 14, the delay per cycle is longer in RI-WuR with a larger queue size as it needs to compete in more slots. On the other hand, the achieved delay with the RI-CPT-WuR MAC protocol is much shorter and it is almost stable. This is because of the fact that the number of competitions is directly corresponding to N which is ﬁxed as 5. For the same reason, ncfpt is lower and its packet reliability ratio is increased linearly with Q, as depicted in Fig. 15. This is the result of the fact that RI-CPT-WuR delivers η (≈ Q) packets with a fewer number of collisions, gaining Q times higher γ than that of RI-WuR at Q = 10.

C. Performance Comparison Under an Error-Prone Channel
To evaluate the performance of RI-CPT-WuR under errorprone channel conditions, we conducted simulations based on a network with a varying number of nodes N = 1 ∼ 10, each with Q = 5, λ = 0.5 packet/s, and it is operated under an error-prone channel with Pecppt = 0.1. In Figs. 16 to 18, we illustrate the performance in terms of delay, lifetime, and energy efﬁciency and compare the results with the ones obtained under an error-free channel.
In an extreme case when there is only one active node, that node will deliver its q packets consecutively after receiving a WuC. Even though some transmissions failed due to channel errors, those packets with failed transmissions will be retransmitted immediately. Therefore, the delay resulted in the errorprone channel is slightly longer than the one obtained in the error-free channel. However, access competition exists as more number of nodes become active. Recall that RI-CPT-WuR reserves slots as many as the number of packets nodes contain. Because of channel errors, some packets may have to be retransmitted. In that case, a packet with failed transmission is retransmitted in the next slot. The same procedure repeats for each packet in the queue until all reserved slots are utilized. When transmission failures occur, a node needs to compete again for transmitting its remaining packets by requiring additional slots, resulting in a longer delay. Therefore, the delay difference is larger when there are more active nodes in the network, as depicted in Fig. 16. At N = 10, on average 1.25 additional slot is required to transfer the same number of packets when Pecppt = 0.1.
Moreover, the larger the node population, the higher the access competition. Consequently, each node consumes higher energy in an error-prone channel, leading to a shorter lifetime, as shown in Fig. 17. For the same reason, lower energy efﬁciency is observed in Fig. 18 when more retransmissions are required due to channel failures. Note however that the same network throughput is achieved under both channel conditions. This is because throughput in this paper is deﬁned as the total number of packets delivered in the same cycle regardless of the number slots used in that cycle. In this case, the difference between these two channel conditions exists only in terms of energy consumption and energy efﬁciency. For a network with N = 10 nodes and the same conﬁguration for other parameters, a 10% error-prone channel causes on average 8.4% lower energy efﬁciency.

VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we proposed a novel receiver-initiated WuR MAC protocol in order to improve delay, packet reliability ratio, and energy efﬁciency for WuR enabled IoT networks. The proposed RI-CPT-WuR MAC protocol allows nodes transmit multiple packets consecutively with one successful access competition and its parameters are conﬁgurable based on trafﬁc arrival rate, network population, as well as queue size. Moreover, we developed two DTMC models to evaluate the performance of the RI-CPT-WuR MAC and RI-WuR protocols. By jointly solving these two DTMCs, the successful transmission probability is calculated. We further deduced expressions for performance metrics including node and network throughput, delay, packet reliability ratio, energy consumption and lifetime, as well as energy efﬁciency. The obtained numerical results based on both error-free and error-prone channel conditions demonstrate that the RI-CPT-WuR protocol outperforms the prevailing RI-WuR protocol with respect to all these studied parameters. The discrete-event simulation results conﬁrm that the operation of both RI-CPT-WuR and RI-WuR protocols can be precisely predicted based on the developed models.
